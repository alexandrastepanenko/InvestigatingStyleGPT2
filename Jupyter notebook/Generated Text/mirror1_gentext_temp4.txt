<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want a return to the bubble system in England - but accepted compulsory face coverings in class could make a comeback Secondary school pupils could be told to wear face-masks in school once again to keep Covid at bay this winter, the Education Secretary has admitted. Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want to see the return of bubbles where whole classes or year groups were sent home after a positive test. But he admitted that compulsory face-masks in lessons could make a come-back if cases spike. "I've got a contingency plan, as you would expect me to do. It contains lots of contingencies, including masks, absolutely," he told Sky News. The mandatory wearing of face coverings in schools and colleges was scrapped in May, but Government guidance says that directors of public health could advise schools to reintroduce them if cases spike. It comes after Government figures showed the number of children out of school for Covid-19 related reasons in England increased by two thirds in a fortnight. The DfE estimates that 2.5% of all pupils - more than 204,000 children - were not in class for reasons connected to coronavirus on Thursday last week. This is up from 122,300 children, or 1.5% of all pupils, on September 16 - a 67% rise from two weeks ago. Mr Zahawi also defended the slow rollout of carbon dioxide monitors which were first promised by the Department for Education in August. In Wales, secondary school and college pupils will be advised to take daily lateral flow tests for seven days if someone in their household tests positive for coronavirus, the Welsh Government has announced. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Zahawi said he was concerned about the impact Covid-19 measures had on attendance. He said: "The good news is that - and thanks to the brilliant teachers and support staff and parents and children - 99% of schools are open. "Attendance has gone up, the last set of figures I looked at was about 90%, which obviously will fluctuate depending on infection rates. "But my priority is to protect education, keep those schools open." But he said he was not looking to return to the bubble system to do so, "because actually, you saw the fall off in attendance which really does harm mental wellbeing, mental health of children". That is despite Englnad's schools previously being told backup plans must "cover the possibility that in some local areas it may become necessary to reintroduce 'bubbles' for a temporary period, to reduce mixing between groups. "Any decision to recommend the reintroduction of 'bubbles' would not be taken lightly and would need to take account of the detrimental impact they can have on the delivery of education."

<|startofarticle|>  The Labour leader said the party was 'fighting for every vote' as he vowed to take 'full responsibility' for Thursday's election results Keir Starmer has said he will take "full responsibility" for the result of the Hartlepool by-election as an opinion poll showed the Tories opening up a double-digit lead in the constituency. The Labour leader said the party would be "fighting for every vote" and that he hoped it would not lose another seat in the Red Wall. But he admitted Labour still had "a mountain to climb" after its devastating defeat under Jeremy Corbyn to be in a position to oust the Tories from power. Ahead of Thursday's vote, a Survation poll for ITV's Good Morning Britain put the Conservatives on 50% â€“ 17 points ahead of Labour in a seat it has held since it was created in 1974. The scale of the challenge in the seat is not a surprise to many in Labour as the Brexit Party received a chunk of the vote in 2019 and popular local Tory mayor Ben Houchen has brought investment to the region. Mr Starmer's bigger test will be how Labour does in council and mayoral elections across England, as well as national polls in Scotland and Wales. "I hope we won't lose Hartlepool. We are fighting for every vote there. I know that every vote has to be earned," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. "I said on the day that I was elected (Labour leader) that it was a mountain to climb. It is, we are climbing it and I've got a burning desire to build a better future for our country. "I don't think anybody realistically thought that it was possible to turn the Labour Party round from the worst general election result since 1935 to a position to win the next general election within a period of one year. "It was always going to take longer than that." He added: "I take full responsibility for the results, just as I take full responsibility for everything that happens in the Labour Party under my leadership." Some on the Labour left have criticised Mr Starmer for failing to set out an alternative vision for the UK that would challenge that of the Tories. While the Government has been mired in sleaze scandals and rows over Covid contracts, it has also attempted to move its tanks onto Labour's lawn. From coronavirusÂ to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times. The newsletter is sent out twice daily with the latest UK & world politics news, along with leading opinion and analysis. You can sign up here. The Tories have appointed a "levelling up" tsar to help deliver on their 2019 manifesto pledge, following concerns that people struggle to understand what the phrase means. Tory MP Neil O'Brien has been tasked with overseeing the programme that many 2019-intake Tories from former 'Red Wall' seats believe is critical to their re-election. No 10 announced on Tuesday that it would publish a 'levelling-up' white paper to set out more policy detail later this year. Ministers have been accused of channeling funds to Conservative seats rather than into areas which are in most need of economic and infrastructure support. On a campaign visit to Wales, Mr Starmer insisted that Tory sleaze allegations should matter to voters - and showed there was one rule for Boris Johnson, and one for everybody else. "I don't actually go along with this argument that says, 'well it's priced-in, it may be that the Prime Minister is not being straight but it doesn't really matter'," he said. "Being the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is an honour. It's a privilege and we should not ever accept that it's priced in."

<|startofarticle|>  The Labour leader said he did not 'want or expect' to stop people seeing their loved ones due to Covid, coronavirus infections or the Easter break - but wanted to be prepared to delay their return ?" Keir Starmer is the Labour leader said to be the Labour leader, but he has never held a second job or been elected a mayor or national secretary. He is believed to have left Labour to take the seat taken by the Tories in 2019 with the only other senior Labour post being envoy. But Mr Starmer, the former shadow Brexit secretary who has worked for the Labour leader in office for seven years, told the Mirror he did not want to part company with the Tories for now. "I think that's a very good course of action for the moment," he said. He added: "If the situation continues to go wrong then I will be prepared to stand in and fix it." But if the situation worsens further, Mr Starmer told the Mirror he would "bring his wife a Christmas hat and a fistful of presents". He suggested he might as well stop.  More than two years on from the murder of Sarah Everard, Boris Johnson has delivered a short-handed Â£45,000-a-year cut in National Insurance, worth just Â£18.5m. The cut follows a similar one last year which saw the Â£20-a-week uplift only temporary. In both cases the benefactors were not compensated for their time invested in improving the lives of people in deprived areas. "It looks a lot like what you see with poverty stricken people," Mr Starmer said. "People are priced out of their money, their energy and their jobs. It's like you have a subsidy for not having it." Earlier, when asked to rule out another cut, Mr Starmer said: "Well, I'm not going to answer that question." He was unable to say whether Mr Johnson would back the Government's Â£20-a-week uplift for workers set out in the Budget. But the Labour leader said it was vital to know what will happen if the Government does not back down from its commitment to end the cut. "At this point we just have to keep everything under review," he said. "The British people have spoken, they have been vocal about their dissatisfaction with our economic system. And they are being heard. "The Government is not going anywhere". Earlier, the energy giant's chairman, Rex Tillerson, told a fringe event at the Tory Party conference in Manchester: "I don't think we should be paying any attention to what is happening in our energy sector, and we need to be paying attention to what is happening in our society." He added: "We also need to be aware of the fact that Daesh is gaining ground in Afghanistan, and we are seeing significant amounts of new recruits coming from Afghanistan. "We also need to be very wary of the Taliban, which is using brutal tactics, and we are seeing significant support for that." He claimed Western sanctions had done the government "no favours". But Mr Johnson said he would do "whatever we could to help the people of Afghanistan" but that he "unequivocally" wanted to see a diplomatic solution to the crisis. He said: "I think we can achieve very, very well by our partnership and cooperation. "But I don't think we can achieve much by ourselves." Mr Tugendhat, who also claimed the British government had "absolutely no interest in seeing a solution to this crisis" and that he did not want to see a humanitarian crisis there, denied that Britain had any interests in the region. He said: "We are not going anywhere". Industry minister Tim Byford told MPs the Government had "no interest" in seeing a humanitarian solution. Labour's Shadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy said: "The British Government has spent years developing a working relationship with the Afghan people and they have no interest in seeing a humanitarian solution in Afghanistan. "The people of Afghanistan deserve a secure and prosperous country, and we know that in time they will be able to understand why our strikes have worked. "And we will see what the Government of Afghanistan has promised." The United Nations says there are now 30,000 people in Afghanistan who are safe. The British Government has been accused of failing to do enough for people after it abandoned its plan to open up refugee camps in the province. Around 20,000 people have been relocated since the start of the year, mostly to neighbouring countries including Pakistan and potentially Iran. Pakistan's President Asif Ali Khan Muttaq told a security conference on terrorism on the Pakistani side of the border that he did not want the UK to take any responsibility for the disruption caused by the Afghans. He told the conference: "We do not object to taking concrete measures which will, in time, enable us to learn how to better respond to their threat and for other countries to follow." Security fears over the region have eased amid international cooperation on Afghanistan. But Britain is said

<|startofarticle|>  The NHS data said pregnant women make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care as they urge mums-to-be to get vaccinated Pregnant women are being urged to get vaccinated as soon as they are offered the chance, according to figures. NHS data said the pregnant women make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care. Officials fear that infections from the new strain of the Red List will continue to surge through the UK in the coming weeks. Officials have also warned that the number of cases of Covid 1468-19 that are likely to be recorded this winter is likely to be much higher than during the first wave of the pandemic. The virus has been circulating at this time in the UK meaning that cases are likely to rise fast. Vaccines chiefs have warned that the Prime Minister's decision will leave parents facing a Â£US5,000 tax bill for failing to vaccinate their children. The move is part of the package of Tory promises to "clean up" the Government's mess and avoid a repeat of last year when the UK was caught in a second Covid surge. Mr Starmer said: "Last Christmas is sadly sadly much too late for that. "It is not late for me, it's not even late for you, it's justâ€¦ we will do what we can to make sure that you have everything you can need to be able to travel abroad, to do all sorts of things." He added: "I know that people are going to be nervous, we know that people are going to be nervous about the move to a concentration camp."

<|startofarticle|>  The Mirror has been told that Boris Johnson has cleared his diary today for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team, while Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned there are 'no guarantees' Christmas gatherings will be able to go ahead Tougher restrictions may be imposed in England next week as Covid infections soar. The Mirror understands Boris Johnson is set to have urgent meetings tomorrow with scientists and his top team. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned there are "no guarantees" Christmas gatherings will be able to go ahead. It comes days after Mr Johnson assured the public the Government will not "cancel" Christmas. Measures on the table include a ban on households mixing and the closure of indoor hospitality venues and non-essential shops within days. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has failed to rule out a circuit breaker lockdown in England before Christmas to cut pressure on the NHS. Fears the Government will "cancel" Christmas come as official figures show there were another 82,866 cases of Covid today, up more than 50% in the past week. Covid cases topped 80,000 for only the fourth time since the start of pandemic with the new Omicron variant up 50% in just 24 hours. The Government's scientific advisers said it was "almost certain" there were hundreds of thousands of new Omicron infections each day. Mr Javid warned there were "no guarantees" that Christmas gatherings would be able to go ahead as planned. The Government's SAGE committee of advisers has cautioned that hospitalisations could surge to between 3,000 and 10,000 a day unless urgent action is taken. The Health Secretary admitted that "everything is under review" after the grim assessment suggested that infections could reach two million by the end of the month. The Mirror has been told Boris Johnson has cleared his diary for tomorrow for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team. No10 said that the PM was in touch with his advisers and keeping abreast of the data, while the four nations of the UK met for a Cobra meeting on the situation. But - with just five days before families are due to gather for Christmas â€“ a source said there was no plans for a press conference tomorrow announcing any changes to restrictions. Mr Javid, 52, admitted that scientific advice warning of a possible a surge in hospital admissions from Omicron was worrying - and that he would be cutting down on hugs with his elderly mum. He suggested the Government could not rule out any new measures before Christmas, adding: "There are no guarantees in this pandemic. "At this point we just have to keep everything under review." Earlier, when asked to rule out tougher rules in the coming days, he said: "We are assessing the situation, it's very fast-moving. "We've seen with Omicron there's a lot that we still don't know about Omicron. That's the truth of the matter. The reality is there's a lot of uncertainty." But he admitted that it was "time to be more cautious" and the Government would do "what is necessary" to keep the public safe. The PM is believed to prefer the prospect of delaying restrictions until after Christmas - even though that could be too late for the NHS. Mr Javid's remarks will cause yet more outrage among Conservative backbenchers after almost 100 voted to block much milder restrictions last week. The PM - who has repeatedly insisted that Christmas will go ahead - is likely to face another huge Tory rebellion to push any changes through. The Government has said MPs would be asked to return to Parliament to vote if new restrictions are needed. One Tory rebel, senior MP Tobias Ellwood, said the Government had to improve its handling of the pandemic. "It's on the bus, off the bus. The economy stops then starts again. We can't continue doing that," he said. The speculation over new restrictions comes after experts warned there are likely already hundreds of thousands of new infections from Omicron every day. If even a small number of them ended up in hospital it could risk overwhelming the NHS. Of the 82,866 cases of Covid today these included 12,133 cases of Omicron, up from 10,059 the day before, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Deaths in England of people with the variant rose to 12, up from seven, while hospital admissions increased to 104, up from 85. Prof Stephen Reicher, a member of SAGE, said it was clear that Plan B measures alone would not stop the spiralling numbers of cases. He cautioned that waiting until after Christmas to act is "probably too late". Fellow SAGE member Professor Sir David Spiegelhalter said: "We can't wait for hospitalisations to go through the roof before we do something about it, because by then it's too late. "In fact what happens by the end of this year is pretty well built-in now. There's almost pretty well nothing we can do about it." Former

<|startofarticle|>  Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK would consider joining the EU's maritime "red list" system when the AUKUS deal expires at the end of October The AUKUS deal has suffered a heavy defeat in the House of Lords as MPs backed a cross-party move to keep it. The Northern Ireland Protocol expires at the end of October, meaning the UK is banned from doing so in any way on its soil. But the EU has its priorities elsewhere as well, including on trains, bridges and airports. Dominic Raab said: "We've got to proceed with caution, we can't allow the good work that has been done by the AUKUS deal to go unheeded. "We've seen that contingency plan has to be followed through. We can't afford to risk the AUKUS deal doing nothing." The Foreign Secretary added: "What I'm not talking about is rejoining the EU or anything like that, I'm not even talking about annexing countries or anything like that." But if Mr Raab made it happen he would only be covering the cost - and the cost so far he has not had to use leverage - to get the Government through a major setback as the unionist Left-wing MPs demanded he resign. The Labour leader had been a key player in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and was seen as a friend of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But after the row he was forced into saying that the "price to get a better deal for the Palestinian people has got a price to get a better deal for Britain". Mr Raab, who has previously broken ranks with the EU on climate change by opposing the planting of alfalfa, retweeted a post by Mr Johnson which featured a photo of a table with no grapes on it. He told the Mirror: "What upsets me is there's going to be people who'll say, 'Well, you can't have both'. "It's not a question of we can't have both. The question is can we? Can we really afford to pay the price of going out of our way to get a better deal for the people of Gaza?" He added: "What I'm not talking about is rejoining the EU, what I'm not talking about is ripping up the current agreement and starting again - it's not the same. "This is not compromise, it's ripping up the same agreement as all the different watering down projects and watering down camps for terrorists." The Labour leader had been a key player in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process before he was sacked by Mr Johnson in protest at the way the UKqa was split up between the UK and the EU. He told Mr Starmer: "What I'm not talking about is, what are you talking about? What are you talking about is listening to the people of Gaza? The people of Gaza are being killed for no reason, for no reason, for no reason. This is a direct response to the firestorm that was the other day, and people were asking for it. "The answer is, we can't afford to be in a position where we are treating them the same way we would treat other people." He added: "What I'm not talking about is rejoining the EU, what I'm not talking about is ripping up the current agreement and starting again. This is as bad as it gets." Mr Starmer said that the UK's relationship with the EU was getting "chaos" in the UK Government's hands. He said that with a "fairer" system, he would allow people to negotiate for them. The Chancellor was asked if he was prepared to "rip up" up Britain's long-promised free trade deal with the EU, after Brexit minister Lord Frost demanded a "tle reopening" to ordinary trade deals. Mr Starmer said: "Sirius Rhetoric is throwing people off their feet. "It's very, very clear what I'm not talking about. "We don't want a change that will make Britain less a global leader. We want a result that will make it easier for us to trade across the Atlantic, but we want it to be fair and avoid any kind of special relationship that some people would want." He added: "I don't think that's going to be possible unless and until it is." In explosive revelations, one source told the Mirror there were "many, many" drinks brought by Leave supporters at the referendum which turned the House into a laughing stock. One even claimed that Mr Starmer even told the Prime Minister about the free taxi rides for the final week of the campaign. The Foreign Secretary admitted that Sir James was a regular at the Leave campaign event in Manchester and that he had a "really close" relationship with Mr Johnson even though they had never met.

<|startofarticle|>  The NHS data said pregnant women make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care as they urge mums-to-be to get vaccinated Pregnant women are being urged to get the coronavirus jab after it was revealed one in five critically ill patients are unvaccinated mothers-to-be. NHS data said they make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care. Officials fear early guidance for expectant mothers to avoid the jab until there was more evidence it was safe has put many off. But the advice changed as getting Covid can be dangerous for pregnant women. Some badly hit have had Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation therapy. It is only used when lungs are so damaged a ventilator cannot maintain oxygen levels. Out of all women between 16 and 49 on the special machine, pregnant women make up 32%, up from 6% at the start of lockdown. England's top midwife will today try to reassure women to get the vaccine. Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent said: "This is another stark reminder the jab can keep you, your baby and your loved ones safe. "You can receive vaccination at any time in pregnancy, but the risks unvaccinated pregnant women face of becoming severely unwell if they catch Covid show exactly why we advise you to do so as soon as possible". Claire Bromley, 33, of Kent, spent nearly a month in a critical care unit after catching Covid while pregnant. Recovering at home, she said: "The risk of not having the Covid vaccine far outweighs any doubts about having it." Public Health England said more than 81,000 pregnant women have received their first dose while 65,000 have had their second shot. Carrie Johnson, who is pregnant with her second child, became fully vaccinated this summer and urges others to do the same. The PM's wife understand people's fears but said the evidence was "reassuring" and there was no increased risk of miscarriage. Vaccination during pregnancy is urged by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Royal College of Midwives. Data from 100,000 jabs among UK mums-to-be and 160,000 in the US show there has been no harm to the foetus or infant. Dr Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: "The disproportionate number of unvaccinated pregnant women in intensive care demonstrates a significant risk of severe illness from Covid-19 in pregnancy." There are concerns the vaccine rollout is faltering with only one in nine secondary school pupils in England inoculated so far. Experts warned the slow pace risks the health of children and their older relatives with Covid deaths still averaging 120 a day. Prof Peter Openshaw said low jab rates among teens would "amplify the outbreak". Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  Home Secretary Priti Patel and Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said they were "deeply ashamed" in the downward trend in convictions  for offences including harassment and stalking for more than two years  People are being given up-to-date information about their attackers as a legal requirement kicks in next month. The legal requirement to record suspects as they come under threat of a spiking in hospitalisations will kick in September 9. The Mirror has been told the next stage of the review is "still being worked out" but is "certainly" expected to be months to October. The mandatory recording of suspects as they come under threat of a change will kick in September. It means police will be able to report suspects to police as soon as they are contacted by a suspect - and may call in police even sooner if they feel they may have been targeted. The requirement to record suspects as they come under threat of a change will kick in September. It means police will be able to report suspects to police as soon as they are contacted by a suspect - and may call in police even sooner if they feel they have been targeted. But some may struggle to make ends meet as the UK faces a spike in infections. Some criminals are forced to rely on tunnels dug in their homes. And some families have to rely on being forced to isolate. Mr Johnson told Sky News: "There are a lot of people who have been deprived of the lift for so long because of the Government, the courts and the insurance companies. "Now, there are a lot of people who are able to afford it, who are able to work, who are able to earn a little bit more a little bit more a little bit more, and it's paying off in the sense that we have got Â£6 billion of cuts, which are going to be made in the next fortnight or so, and we will make sure they're made in a way that protects the Rail Delivery Scheme and then we will make sure that people have the security of access to those services." He added: "We will make sure that, as you know, there is a level playing field for those who are able to afford it, and we will make sure that those people are able to access those services properly." Mr Johnson told Sky News: " the poorest families will be feeling the squeeze most, particularly in schools, because of the disappearing of education. "That's why I think it's really important for us to make sure that we can make sure that those who are in power, those who are in charge, that are able to function properly properly properly in those conditions." He said ministers should "deliver on the promise" to rebuild the schools by next January. The PM also said the NAHT would be "driven" by students' concerns - by whether to rebuild the remaining 15% of the school system that were left behind. He added: "That's the discussion we should be having, and we should be having it with our members, because we want to make sure that we can make sure that we have sufficient capacity to provide services to the population at large, and not just the Conservatives."

<|startofarticle|>  The Mirror has been told that Boris Johnson has cleared his diary today for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team, while Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned there are 'no guarantees' Christmas gatherings will be able to go ahead Tougher restrictions may be imposed in England next week as Covid infections soar. The Mirror understands Boris Johnson is set to have urgent meetings tomorrow with scientists and his top team. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned there are "no guarantees" Christmas gatherings will be able to go ahead. It comes days after Mr Johnson assured the public the Government will not "cancel" Christmas. Measures on the table include a ban on households mixing and the closure of indoor hospitality venues and non-essential shops within days. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has failed to rule out a circuit breaker lockdown in England before Christmas to cut pressure on the NHS. Fears the Government will "cancel" Christmas come as official figures show there were another 82,866 cases of Covid today, up more than 50% in the past week. Covid cases topped 80,000 for only the fourth time since the start of pandemic with the new Omicron variant up 50% in just 24 hours. The Government's scientific advisers said it was "almost certain" there were hundreds of thousands of new Omicron infections each day. Mr Javid warned there were "no guarantees" that Christmas gatherings would be able to go ahead as planned. The Government's SAGE committee of advisers has cautioned that hospitalisations could surge to between 3,000 and 10,000 a day unless urgent action is taken. The Health Secretary admitted that "everything is under review" after the grim assessment suggested that infections could reach two million by the end of the month. The Mirror has been told Boris Johnson has cleared his diary for tomorrow for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team. No10 said that the PM was in touch with his advisers and keeping abreast of the data, while the four nations of the UK met for a Cobra meeting on the situation. But - with just five days before families are due to gather for Christmas â€“ a source said there was no plans for a press conference tomorrow announcing any changes to restrictions. Mr Javid, 52, admitted that scientific advice warning of a possible a surge in hospital admissions from Omicron was worrying - and that he would be cutting down on hugs with his elderly mum. He suggested the Government could not rule out any new measures before Christmas, adding: "There are no guarantees in this pandemic. "At this point we just have to keep everything under review." Earlier, when asked to rule out tougher rules in the coming days, he said: "We are assessing the situation, it's very fast-moving. "We've seen with Omicron there's a lot that we still don't know about Omicron. That's the truth of the matter. The reality is there's a lot of uncertainty." But he admitted that it was "time to be more cautious" and the Government would do "what is necessary" to keep the public safe. The PM is believed to prefer the prospect of delaying restrictions until after Christmas - even though that could be too late for the NHS. Mr Javid's remarks will cause yet more outrage among Conservative backbenchers after almost 100 voted to block much milder restrictions last week. The PM - who has repeatedly insisted that Christmas will go ahead - is likely to face another huge Tory rebellion to push any changes through. The Government has said MPs would be asked to return to Parliament to vote if new restrictions are needed. One Tory rebel, senior MP Tobias Ellwood, said the Government had to improve its handling of the pandemic. "It's on the bus, off the bus. The economy stops then starts again. We can't continue doing that," he said. The speculation over new restrictions comes after experts warned there are likely already hundreds of thousands of new infections from Omicron every day. If even a small number of them ended up in hospital it could risk overwhelming the NHS. Of the 82,866 cases of Covid today these included 12,133 cases of Omicron, up from 10,059 the day before, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Deaths in England of people with the variant rose to 12, up from seven, while hospital admissions increased to 104, up from 85. Prof Stephen Reicher, a member of SAGE, said it was clear that Plan B measures alone would not stop the spiralling numbers of cases. He cautioned that waiting until after Christmas to act is "probably too late". Fellow SAGE member Professor Sir David Spiegelhalter said: "We can't wait for hospitalisations to go through the roof before we do something about it, because by then it's too late. "In fact what happens by the end of this year is pretty well built-in now. There's almost pretty well nothing we can do about it." Former

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi (C) and Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty (2L) participate in a quiz to introduce students to the different vaccines, treatments and restrictions Students in England should continue to be told which vaccines they can and cannot have, according to plans announced by the Government. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi (C) and Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty will give a statement on the plans at a No 10 briefing. The Education Secretary said the data is "fantastic" but that "it will take" the impact of the pandemic. The changes coincide with huge protests against cruel testing and punishment of children in the capital. Boris Johnson has been accused of failing to protect children during the pandemic - with Boris Johnson on Wednesday set to face the stark choice between cutting spending on schools and raising taxes on the wealthy to clear the NHS backlog. He will say yes to schools the Tories spent Â£120bn on and a week's paycheneur Boris Johnson has been urged to perform a U-turn on plans to require young people to self-isolate for 10 weeks if there is a spike in cases among ethnic minority children. The Prime Minister was accused of "morally" breaches after he delayed a decision on a ban on mandarins' socialising for 10 days amid concerns it would lead to angering constituents. Mr Johnson told Sky News he was "not prepared" to re-open the self-isolation row with a vote to ban social distancing for children in a pandemic-hit country. He was also accused of making a "difficult" decision after consulting with ministers despite warnings they could not rule out a ban. But he refused to rule out a ban saying: "We will look at it." The Government has been urged to make face coverings compulsory on public transport after ministers warned there would be a "significant" impact on lost capacity. Labour has written to the Prime Minister asking for "clear guidance" on how and when they can make face coverings compulsory on public transport. But the Government has also axed face-masks in schools and closed nightclubs. Shadow transport secretary Lucy Powell said: "The Government has spent the last decade undermining the very model children require to learn to live with mental illness and sadly it has failed to do anything to move this issue forward. "We have made no assessment of the immense costs and disruption this pandemic has on our education, health and wellbeing. "And when we think there is a moment of opportunity, we can make those changes at the next general election. "But here we are, two years later, and the Government has made no assessment of the impact of the pandemic and no assessment of the financial cost of doing so." She added: "This Government will not take responsibility for the consequences of our inaction. We will not be a country that has not had its education and wellbeing damaged and we will rebuild from under the damage caused by the pandemic." Train operators have pledged to "support" passengers who continue wearing face coverings if they become voluntary.  Industry body the Rail Delivery Group said "wearing a mask helps protect others", but demanded that any relaxation of the rules around their use indoors must apply to trains. An spokesman said: "Travelling by train is low risk and carriages are well ventilated with air regularly refreshed either by air conditioning systems, or by doors and windows being opened, so any decision to leave public transport behind other parts of the economy would need to be based on the science. "Of course, train companies will continue with extra cleaning and better information about how busy services are, and given that wearing a mask helps protect others, we would also support people who wished to continue wearing one in future if it becomes voluntary."

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want a return to the bubble system in England - but accepted that it was time to make the situation worse Ministers are saying that the Brexit process was "robust" and that there was no point having "more meetings and trying to strike a deal". Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi is expected to confirm that his team have reached an agreement to "complete the work" from which they had come in. But it would mean that Britain could leave the EU's legal status at the EU's border with the States has prompted concern among scientists and sceptical MPs. The danger of a "digital India" Brexit appeared to have been over, the Government has said. No 10 has "very serious questions" about the rationale for leaving the EU and "how do we ensure our laws are followed" in the UK, said a group within the UK Government. They added: "Should we accept that leaving the EU will require some level of change in our legal status? "Should we accept that in practice we need to change our legal status to allow us to do that? "Should we accept that we have to change our legal status to allow us to do that? "Should we accept that we have to change our legal status to allow us to do that? "Should we accept that we have to change our legal status to allow us to do that? "Should we accept that we have to pay a higher price for doing that which we have already earned, and more importantly for doing that which we have already earned, then for all of us, in our capacity as citizens?" It is almost two years since we left the single market and customs union, the "real" Brexit that we avoided in 2020 due to the transition period. In that time, we have "passed" through with our aim of having the UK's passport invalid for six months or more if there was a "serious and imminent threat" to the national security of a European country. "We are not going to give up on this. We are not going to accept that it's possible to remain in the EU and we will very much be asking for and deserve a new society based on respect for the rules and for us to live in a free and democratic country," he said. After months apart, millions of people in the UK can now meet with six people or two households outdoors. The "stay at home" order also ends, meaning they can travel for longer distances to meet up outside - as long as they don't stay overnight. Sir Mark Walport, former government chief scientific adviser and a member of SAGE, warned that social distancing "still does matter" outdoors. He added: "At the end of the day, the virus gets from one person to another by proximity and proximity can happen outside as well, hence your discussion about hugging." Advising when we he thinks we should hug elderly relatives, he said: "When the evidence shows that the case numbers are really, really low indeed, that's the point, and so some degree of caution makes sense." Government minister Nigel Huddleston urged people to hold back from hugging friends and relatives. "I want to hug my mum so believe me, politicians are human beings too and we are desperately as keen to do this as everybody else," he said. "Please, uncomfortable as it is, please don't do the hugging because what you're doing is then risking the health of the very people that you love. "So, just a matter of time, we'll be looking at social distancing and other measures as time goes on." Organised outdoor sport was also allowed from yesterday with facilities including football pitches, basketball courts, golf courses and outdoor swimming pools reopening across England. Mr Johnson revealed he was looking forward to returning to the tennis court while Keir Starmer was playing five-aside football with friends last night.

The Labour leader said he was looking forward to being able to "shout and scream" on the football pitch once again. In Wales the stay local order ended on Saturday and people were allowed to stay in self-catered holiday accommodation. The stay at home order is to end in Scotland on Friday, while in Northern Ireland up to six people, or two households, will be able to meet outdoors from Thursday.

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want a return to the bubble system in England - but accepted compulsory face coverings in class could make a comeback Secondary school pupils could be told to wear face-masks in school once again to keep Covid at bay this winter, the Education Secretary has admitted. Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want to see the return of bubbles where whole classes or year groups were sent home after a positive test. But he admitted that compulsory face-masks in lessons could make a come-back if cases spike. "I've got a contingency plan, as you would expect me to do. It contains lots of contingencies, including masks, absolutely," he told Sky News. The mandatory wearing of face coverings in schools and colleges was scrapped in May, but Government guidance says that directors of public health could advise schools to reintroduce them if cases spike. It comes after Government figures showed the number of children out of school for Covid-19 related reasons in England increased by two thirds in a fortnight. The DfE estimates that 2.5% of all pupils - more than 204,000 children - were not in class for reasons connected to coronavirus on Thursday last week. This is up from 122,300 children, or 1.5% of all pupils, on September 16 - a 67% rise from two weeks ago. Mr Zahawi also defended the slow rollout of carbon dioxide monitors which were first promised by the Department for Education in August. In Wales, secondary school and college pupils will be advised to take daily lateral flow tests for seven days if someone in their household tests positive for coronavirus, the Welsh Government has announced. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Zahawi said he was concerned about the impact Covid-19 measures had on attendance. He said: "The good news is that - and thanks to the brilliant teachers and support staff and parents and children - 99% of schools are open. "Attendance has gone up, the last set of figures I looked at was about 90%, which obviously will fluctuate depending on infection rates. "But my priority is to protect education, keep those schools open." But he said he was not looking to return to the bubble system to do so, "because actually, you saw the fall off in attendance which really does harm mental wellbeing, mental health of children". That is despite Englnad's schools previously being told backup plans must "cover the possibility that in some local areas it may become necessary to reintroduce 'bubbles' for a temporary period, to reduce mixing between groups. "Any decision to recommend the reintroduction of 'bubbles' would not be taken lightly and would need to take account of the detrimental impact they can have on the delivery of education."

<|startofarticle|>  The Mirror has learned the former attorney general missed voting while in Mauritius this week despite facing growing criticism for being abroad while Parliament is sitting Under-fire Sir Geoffrey Cox this week missed yet more Commons votes from abroad - this time from Mauritius more than 6,000 miles from Britain. Sources in the island nation told the Mirror the former attorney general was on a "short business trip" there and "met with quite a few people" for meetings. The former attorney general is a partner in an international law firm, Thomas More International Ltd, based in the country, which is in the Indian Ocean. Sir Geoffrey is believed to have left Mauritius, with which he has long-standing links, on Tuesday night meaning he missed at least two days when Parliament was in session. While he was away, MPs voted four times on two separate bills - telecommunications and sewage - but he was paired with an Opposition MP for them all meaning he had permission to be absent. Sir Geoffrey, who has not broken any Commons rules by voting from Mauritius and is likely to have had the blessing of the Tory chief whip, has been approached for comment. It comes after Sir Geoffrey faced criticism for working as a legal advisor in the British Virgin Islands for several weeks earlier this year while the Commons was sitting. While his trip to the Caribbean did not break any rules, he has been reported to the standards commissioner after footage emerged of him taking part in later hearings from his Commons office. MPs are banned from using their Parliamentary offices or resources for outside work. Shadow Commons leader Thangam Debbonaire blasted: "What on earth must Geoffrey Cox's constituents think? "He is meant to be representing them but instead habitually misses days and days of parliamentary time putting his business interests first. "The Prime Minister must make Geoffrey Cox choose between putting his constituents first or his own interests." The top-flight QC has been at the centre of a new sleaze storm after earning more than Â£1m from legal work in the last year. He clocked in 22 hours a week on average - on top of his Â£81k job as a Tory MP. Mr Johnson has refused to condemn Sir Geoffrey, arguing that it would be "inappropriate" for him to comment on his case. He even argued MPs having second jobs "has actually strengthened our democracy" by bringing outside experience to Westminster.  But he added: "If that system is going to continue today, then it is crucial that MPs follow the rules" including putting the job of an MP first. Sir Geoffrey visited the British Virgin Islands in April and May this year - 4,000 miles away from his Devon seat - and cast Commons votes remotely from there while doing legal work. He had the permission of chief whip Mark Spencer, already under fire over the Owen Paterson scandal, to vote by proxy while Parliament was sitting. While his trip to the Caribbean did not break any Commons rules, footage has now emerged of Sir Geoffrey taking part in later hearings on September 14. MPs are banned from using their Parliamentary offices or resources for outside work but the video appears to show Sir Geoffrey in an office in Parliament. At one point he gets up, only to tell the hearing later: "Forgive my absence during some of the morning - I'm afraid the bell went off."  This is thought to refer to the division bell, which rings loudly across Westminster to alert MPs and peers that they are needed to vote. Records suggest Sir Geoffrey appeared in a corruption inquiry on behalf of the British Virgin Islands government on eleven separate days the Commons sat this year. There were three in May, two in June, two in September and four in October.  Some were in person on a trip to the Caribbean tax haven - while most were virtual after his return to the UK.  By comparison, he has spoken just once in the Commons chamber in the last 18 months. The top Tory had been reported to the standards watchdog by Labour's Angela Rayner who said the alleged use of the office appeared to be "an egregious, brazen breach of the rules". She has written to standards commissioner Kathryn Stone asking her for "guidance on beginning a formal investigation on this matter".

<|startofarticle|>  The Mirror has been told that Boris Johnson has cleared his diary today for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team, while Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned there are 'no guarantees' Christmas gatherings will be able to go ahead Tougher restrictions may be imposed in England next week as Covid infections soar. The Mirror understands Boris Johnson is set to have urgent meetings tomorrow with scientists and his top team. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned there are "no guarantees" Christmas gatherings will be able to go ahead. It comes days after Mr Johnson assured the public the Government will not "cancel" Christmas. Measures on the table include a ban on households mixing and the closure of indoor hospitality venues and non-essential shops within days. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has failed to rule out a circuit breaker lockdown in England before Christmas to cut pressure on the NHS. Fears the Government will "cancel" Christmas come as official figures show there were another 82,866 cases of Covid today, up more than 50% in the past week. Covid cases topped 80,000 for only the fourth time since the start of pandemic with the new Omicron variant up 50% in just 24 hours. The Government's scientific advisers said it was "almost certain" there were hundreds of thousands of new Omicron infections each day. Mr Javid warned there were "no guarantees" that Christmas gatherings would be able to go ahead as planned. The Government's SAGE committee of advisers has cautioned that hospitalisations could surge to between 3,000 and 10,000 a day unless urgent action is taken. The Health Secretary admitted that "everything is under review" after the grim assessment suggested that infections could reach two million by the end of the month. The Mirror has been told Boris Johnson has cleared his diary for tomorrow for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team. No10 said that the PM was in touch with his advisers and keeping abreast of the data, while the four nations of the UK met for a Cobra meeting on the situation. But - with just five days before families are due to gather for Christmas â€“ a source said there was no plans for a press conference tomorrow announcing any changes to restrictions. Mr Javid, 52, admitted that scientific advice warning of a possible a surge in hospital admissions from Omicron was worrying - and that he would be cutting down on hugs with his elderly mum. He suggested the Government could not rule out any new measures before Christmas, adding: "There are no guarantees in this pandemic. "At this point we just have to keep everything under review." Earlier, when asked to rule out tougher rules in the coming days, he said: "We are assessing the situation, it's very fast-moving. "We've seen with Omicron there's a lot that we still don't know about Omicron. That's the truth of the matter. The reality is there's a lot of uncertainty." But he admitted that it was "time to be more cautious" and the Government would do "what is necessary" to keep the public safe. The PM is believed to prefer the prospect of delaying restrictions until after Christmas - even though that could be too late for the NHS. Mr Javid's remarks will cause yet more outrage among Conservative backbenchers after almost 100 voted to block much milder restrictions last week. The PM - who has repeatedly insisted that Christmas will go ahead - is likely to face another huge Tory rebellion to push any changes through. The Government has said MPs would be asked to return to Parliament to vote if new restrictions are needed. One Tory rebel, senior MP Tobias Ellwood, said the Government had to improve its handling of the pandemic. "It's on the bus, off the bus. The economy stops then starts again. We can't continue doing that," he said. The speculation over new restrictions comes after experts warned there are likely already hundreds of thousands of new infections from Omicron every day. If even a small number of them ended up in hospital it could risk overwhelming the NHS. Of the 82,866 cases of Covid today these included 12,133 cases of Omicron, up from 10,059 the day before, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Deaths in England of people with the variant rose to 12, up from seven, while hospital admissions increased to 104, up from 85. Prof Stephen Reicher, a member of SAGE, said it was clear that Plan B measures alone would not stop the spiralling numbers of cases. He cautioned that waiting until after Christmas to act is "probably too late". Fellow SAGE member Professor Sir David Spiegelhalter said: "We can't wait for hospitalisations to go through the roof before we do something about it, because by then it's too late. "In fact what happens by the end of this year is pretty well built-in now. There's almost pretty well nothing we can do about it." Former

<|startofarticle|>  Shadow schools minister Peter Kyle has said ministers should "reopen" discussions with the Aussie PM to explain the disruption to schooling Ministers are being warned that schools in the US are no longer under lockdown while he and his new US counterpart shake up the education system there. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi will travel on to Washington on Tuesday for a series of meetings with tech giants to explain their plans to overhaul the education system. The President and PM were looking to build bridges after the fall-out of the pandemic when Mr Zahawi said the UK "deserves to be applauded" for taking the lead on the issue. Mr Kyle will argue that the UK has a role to play in the region and that Australia should be the next big tech hub after Paris and London. After months of poor poll ratings, Mr Kyle will on Tuesday give a major speech attacking the "perils" of "corrupt" Government decisions and how they can be stopped. He will say that "corrupt" Government decisions include failing to tackle the root causes of health-damaging Covid, including out of control vaccinations. He will call on the new Health Secretary to crack down on "covid surges", including more than 12,000 in schools, to stop children getting sick and avoid the vaccine. And he will launch a major attack on the "slow and uncertain" response to the pandemic, with experts warning it is too little, too late. "The vaccine rollout is too late for much of the UK and the EU are right to be concerned about a surge in Covid cases," he will say. "The Government is missing a generation. Too often our sense of urgency is taken for granted. "We do need a bit of collective responsibility to step up and fix the problem, but too often it comes after the last drop of blood, after a wave, after a wave of people having had their last jab." Mr Kyle will say: "The British people deserve to know the truth about how the British vaccine rollout worked, and why we should support the NHS in its mission, and why the Government should not put the health of the British people at risk." He will highlight the case of 12 to get their second dose as he will say the Government is "not sure" enough about the vaccine rollout. The Prime Minister will also launch a major new probe into the "dirty work" of the Government's Brexit advisers - including leaving the EU. He will say: "We found that while there were important national interests at play, there was also a very serious and very careful balance to be had between good practice and good science. "The Government appears to be moving too fast, and we are aware that there are signs that there are growing pains." But he will say that the EU has a "responsibility to lead the way" as they tackle the backlogs that have built up during the pandemic. He will say: "Good question. The EU has a role to play in helping us to get a solution that protects the peace process, but also guarantees the economic and territorial integrity of the British Virgin Islands." Mr Kyle said that the UK and the EU are "struggling to understand" each other and will argue over how to deal with a Northern Ireland that has grown into a trading post for Britain. He will say the UK is "one stop shop" for other countries when asked if he will be more pragmatic. "I want to be pragmatic," he will say.  But he will touch on the thorny issue of border checks, the EU's support for the DUP and the rise in anti-Semitism. He will say Brexit has been a "massive letdown" for the UK and the EU, despite having had "a rough decade" under the Conservative government. He will claim the EU has "a lot of fish to fry" but is "not surrounded" by "fish" - other countries in the region. What will your response be to the tariffs? "I don't know, actually," he will say.  He will then turn his fire on Boris Johnson's "fish-free future" plans for Northern Ireland, saying they "threaten to blow up the British economy". He will highlight the DUP's poor record in the economic aftermath of the pandemic and his plans for the "red wall" Brexit. What do you make of his claims about jobs being created? "Well, I think they're lying," he will say.  He will accuse Boris Johnson of "missing a huge opportunity" after he sack Theresa May in a reshuffle. Then he will be plunged into deep thought over the fate of the Northern Ireland border, amid ongoing talks on a "Brexit centric" deal. He will, he will say, be able to "go wherever he wants" and could even ask to have his own Brexit deal struck with the EU. Mr Starmer faces calls to cut down on Tory MPs and back a replacement with a "practical" leader who doesn't "keep getting caught up". He will say

<|startofarticle|>  The NHS data said pregnant women make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care as they urge mums-to-be to get vaccinated Pregnant women are being urged to get vaccinated as soon as they are pregnant, as fears of a rare but deadly coronavirus case soar. NHS data said the pregnant women make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care. Officials fear there will be a further wave of Covid cases in the week up to November 13. Vaccination rates for fully vaccinated women are 68.8%, which is slightly better than the 72.8% rate for unvaccinated women. There are a further 37.3% rise for children under 16s. The PM's comment will cause yet more outrage among Labour, which has lost its edge in recent weeks. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: "This is a worrying sign. Vaccination rates for fully vaccinated women are 68.8%, which is slightly better than the 72.8% rate for unvaccinated women. "The Government has been proved right all along â€“ we cannot afford to lose sight of the importance of the importance of the pregnant woman in the United Kingdom." The latest data suggests there are about 39,000 cases a day of Covid in Britain and the number of women in hospital with the virus. It comes as the nation resumes normal life after experiencing its second lockdown in two weeks. People were allowed to come and go as they pleased last night - but tonight they have been warned to go back inside their homes. Tonight was the first thing everyone did in trouble as Boris Johnson was told by a Government source that "everything is going to be okay" for the public to go back inside households. Downing Street was forced to deny claims that the successful Government probe had been a success. The PM tried to get back to Mr Johnson by saying that the public should "go back" to their homes. But when Mr Johnson finally relented he said that it was "not possible" for us to go back into them. That was expected after footage emerged of the successful probe Mr Johnson said that he could "go back" to his own homes. But when Mr Johnson finally relented and said we could go back inside his own homes he said it was "not possible" for them. That was expected after footage emerged of the successful probe into the Tuesday night parties, which destroyed evidence in the case Zacarias and was proof enough of the public concern. Government insiders claimed that Mr Johnson's chief of staff Dan Rosenfield told him about the Tesco probe when it was investigated by the House of Commons science and health committees in January. The following month the PM personally recommended that senior civil servant Sue Gray should resign. The decision not to bring any prosecutions prompted widespread criticism and claims that the probe was rigged to favor the industry. Mr Johnson was re-elected with a 5.4% majority in the Commons, bringing its total majority to more than 11,000. His record as leader has been regarded with alarm by his former closest aides as he attempts to sort out his own future after the chaos of the last year. No 10 said that the PM's "personal decision" had led him to make the decision to quit. But a second source said: "It was a decision that had been made internally that way. "It wasn't something that was brought in immediately as a matter of urgency." Labour had planned to force the Government's hand at reopening the economy after all their woes began. But Mr Johnson's office did not get the memo. A spokesman said: "The Prime Minister read the Mail on Sunday agreement and the commitments it made for post-Brexit trade. "He made the right decision for the UK and the EU, but we want to ensure that we can get on with trade as we seek to rebuild a better future for our people and our planet." Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  Civil servants fear there is no time to save NHS staff as the country's hospitals are on a historic losing streak Secret texts sent to staff telling them they are off for the week back are "f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing week". The Mirror understands the PM's chief of staff is also under pressure to tell staff in advance if they are ill or sickened by the pandemic. It comes just days after Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the UK's special envoy for the war-torn country, warned that the UK "hasn't got a plan" over the border from Ethiopia to the Red Sea Sea where humanitarian workers are desperately trying to save lives. Mr Duncan Smith, the UK's top medic, is understood to be the only one left standing who is not advising the PM on how to deal with the crisis. According to reports, some Cabinet ministers are "dead set" on leaving the country without having one of their long-promised plans ready in two years' time. Mr Johnson is said to be concerned about how the UK will treat Eritrean refugees who reach the UK this summer, as well as the fact that Ethiopia does not join the list of countries that the PM has arbitrarily shut down. So far not a single official English-language publication has reported on the new policy. Labour has published a short statement as: "We are extremely concerned by the growing scale of Refugee Action's concern for the distribution of refugees across the globe. "We are calling on the Government to urgently set up a single, effective, cost-effective, cost-effective plan to help those who are fleeing persecution and persecution back home.

<|startofarticle|>  The NHS data said pregnant women make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care as they urge mums-to-be to get vaccinated Pregnant women are being urged to get vaccinated as fears over hospitalisations of Covid patients soar. NHS data said the pregnant women make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care. Officials fear that around 50% of patients are unvaccinated pregnant women. Vaccination rates for clinically pregnant women are 68.8%, up from 85.7% and 87.2% for clinically pregnant women. Carrie Johnson, of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Royal College of Midwives, said: "The disproportionate number of unvaccinated pregnant women in intensive care demonstrates a significant risk of severe illness from Covid-19 in pregnancy." Vaccination rates for clinically pregnant women are 91.3%, up from 91.3% and 87.3% for clinically pregnant women. Carrie Johnson, of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Royal College of Midwives, said: "The disproportionate number of unvaccinated pregnant women in intensive care demonstrates a significant risk of severe illness from Covid in pregnancy." "The evidence we can say is that the risks from Covid-19 in pregnancy are very, very large." She added: "It is not only about health, it is also about our lifeline, our lifeline is going to be in our hospital." Vaccination rates for clinically pregnant women are 91.3%, up from 91.3% and 87.3% for clinically pregnant women. Carrie Johnson, of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Royal College of Midwives, said: "The disproportionate number of unvaccinated pregnant women in intensive care demonstrates a significant risk of severe illness from Covid in pregnancy." "The evidence we can say is that the risks from Covid-19 in pregnancy are very, very large." She added: "The disproportionate number of unvaccinated pregnant women in intensive care demonstrates that they may be more vulnerable to long-term illness than other pregnant women." SAGE member Sir Jeremy Farrar said: "The Government has spent the last decade undermining the maternity and childcare system and failing to address it properly over the last few weeks. "This has made pregnancy far more difficult for these women and their families, which in many cases, meant far more difficult childcare." He added: "The Government has failed to understand that this is a crisis and that women have had enough and that change is needed now." Boris Johnson announced he was giving 100g of Ovarian Ray for every pregnant woman who tests positive for the disease. It will be offered from next week to all over-50s 50 and over 75.

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want a return to the bubble system in England - but accepted compulsory face coverings in class could make a comeback Secondary school pupils could be told to wear face-masks in school once again to keep Covid at bay this winter, the Education Secretary has admitted. Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want to see the return of bubbles where whole classes or year groups were sent home after a positive test. But he admitted that compulsory face-masks in lessons could make a come-back if cases spike. "I've got a contingency plan, as you would expect me to do. It contains lots of contingencies, including masks, absolutely," he told Sky News. The mandatory wearing of face coverings in schools and colleges was scrapped in May, but Government guidance says that directors of public health could advise schools to reintroduce them if cases spike. It comes after Government figures showed the number of children out of school for Covid-19 related reasons in England increased by two thirds in a fortnight. The DfE estimates that 2.5% of all pupils - more than 204,000 children - were not in class for reasons connected to coronavirus on Thursday last week. This is up from 122,300 children, or 1.5% of all pupils, on September 16 - a 67% rise from two weeks ago. Mr Zahawi also defended the slow rollout of carbon dioxide monitors which were first promised by the Department for Education in August. In Wales, secondary school and college pupils will be advised to take daily lateral flow tests for seven days if someone in their household tests positive for coronavirus, the Welsh Government has announced. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Zahawi said he was concerned about the impact Covid-19 measures had on attendance. He said: "The good news is that - and thanks to the brilliant teachers and support staff and parents and children - 99% of schools are open. "Attendance has gone up, the last set of figures I looked at was about 90%, which obviously will fluctuate depending on infection rates. "But my priority is to protect education, keep those schools open." But he said he was not looking to return to the bubble system to do so, "because actually, you saw the fall off in attendance which really does harm mental wellbeing, mental health of children". That is despite Englnad's schools previously being told backup plans must "cover the possibility that in some local areas it may become necessary to reintroduce 'bubbles' for a temporary period, to reduce mixing between groups. "Any decision to recommend the reintroduction of 'bubbles' would not be taken lightly and would need to take account of the detrimental impact they can have on the delivery of education."

Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want to see the return of bubbles where whole classes or year groups were sent home after a positive test. But he admitted that compulsory face-masks in lessons could make a come-back if cases spike. "I've got a contingency plan, as you would expect me to do. It contains lots of contingencies, including masks, absolutely," he told Sky News. The mandatory wearing of face coverings in schools and colleges was scrapped in May, but Government guidance says that directors of public health could advise schools to reintroduce them if cases spike. It comes after Government figures showed the number of children out of school for Covid-19 related reasons in England increased by two thirds in a fortnight. The DfE estimates that 2.5% of all pupils - more than 204,000 children - were not in class for reasons connected to coronavirus on Thursday last week. This is up from 122,300 children, or 1.5% of all pupils, on September 16 - a 67% rise from two weeks ago. Mr Zahawi also defended the slow rollout of carbon dioxide monitors which were first promised by the Department for Education in August. In Wales, secondary school and college pupils will be advised to take daily lateral flow tests for seven days if someone in their household tests positive for coronavirus, the Welsh Government has announced. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Zahawi said he was concerned about the impact Covid-19 measures had on attendance. He said: "The good news is that - and thanks to the brilliant teachers and support staff and parents and children - 99% of schools are open. "Attendance has gone up, the last set of figures I looked at was about 90%, which obviously will fluctuate depending on infection rates. "But my priority is to protect education, keep those schools open." But he said he was not looking to return to the bubble system to do so, "because actually, you saw the fall off in attendance which really does harm mental wellbeing, mental health of children". That is despite Englnad's schools previously being told backup plans must "cover the possibility that in some local areas it may become necessary to reintroduce 'bubbles' for a temporary period, to reduce mixing between groups. "Any decision to recommend the reintroduction of 'bubbles' would not be taken lightly and would need to take account of the detrimental impact they can have on the delivery of education."

<|startofarticle|>  The Mirror has been told that Boris Johnson has cleared his diary today for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team, while Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned there are 'no guarantees' Christmas gatherings will be able to go ahead Tougher restrictions may be imposed in England next week as Covid infections soar. The Mirror understands Boris Johnson is set to have urgent meetings tomorrow with scientists and his top team. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned there are "no guarantees" Christmas gatherings will be able to go ahead. It comes days after Mr Johnson assured the public the Government will not "cancel" Christmas. Measures on the table include a ban on households mixing and the closure of indoor hospitality venues and non-essential shops within days. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has failed to rule out a circuit breaker lockdown in England before Christmas to cut pressure on the NHS. Fears the Government will "cancel" Christmas come as official figures show there were another 82,866 cases of Covid today, up more than 50% in the past week. Covid cases topped 80,000 for only the fourth time since the start of pandemic with the new Omicron variant up 50% in just 24 hours. The Government's scientific advisers said it was "almost certain" there were hundreds of thousands of new Omicron infections each day. Mr Javid warned there were "no guarantees" that Christmas gatherings would be able to go ahead as planned. The Government's SAGE committee of advisers has cautioned that hospitalisations could surge to between 3,000 and 10,000 a day unless urgent action is taken. The Health Secretary admitted that "everything is under review" after the grim assessment suggested that infections could reach two million by the end of the month. The Mirror has been told Boris Johnson has cleared his diary for tomorrow for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team. No10 said that the PM was in touch with his advisers and keeping abreast of the data, while the four nations of the UK met for a Cobra meeting on the situation. But - with just five days before families are due to gather for Christmas â€“ a source said there was no plans for a press conference tomorrow announcing any changes to restrictions. Mr Javid, 52, admitted that scientific advice warning of a possible a surge in hospital admissions from Omicron was worrying - and that he would be cutting down on hugs with his elderly mum. He suggested the Government could not rule out any new measures before Christmas, adding: "There are no guarantees in this pandemic. "At this point we just have to keep everything under review." Earlier, when asked to rule out tougher rules in the coming days, he said: "We are assessing the situation, it's very fast-moving. "We've seen with Omicron there's a lot that we still don't know about Omicron. That's the truth of the matter. The reality is there's a lot of uncertainty." But he admitted that it was "time to be more cautious" and the Government would do "what is necessary" to keep the public safe. The PM is believed to prefer the prospect of delaying restrictions until after Christmas - even though that could be too late for the NHS. Mr Javid's remarks will cause yet more outrage among Conservative backbenchers after almost 100 voted to block much milder restrictions last week. The PM - who has repeatedly insisted that Christmas will go ahead - is likely to face another huge Tory rebellion to push any changes through. The Government has said MPs would be asked to return to Parliament to vote if new restrictions are needed. One Tory rebel, senior MP Tobias Ellwood, said the Government had to improve its handling of the pandemic. "It's on the bus, off the bus. The economy stops then starts again. We can't continue doing that," he said. The speculation over new restrictions comes after experts warned there are likely already hundreds of thousands of new infections from Omicron every day. If even a small number of them ended up in hospital it could risk overwhelming the NHS. Of the 82,866 cases of Covid today these included 12,133 cases of Omicron, up from 10,059 the day before, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Deaths in England of people with the variant rose to 12, up from seven, while hospital admissions increased to 104, up from 85. Prof Stephen Reicher, a member of SAGE, said it was clear that Plan B measures alone would not stop the spiralling numbers of cases. He cautioned that waiting until after Christmas to act is "probably too late". Fellow SAGE member Professor Sir David Spiegelhalter said: "We can't wait for hospitalisations to go through the roof before we do something about it, because by then it's too late. "In fact what happens by the end of this year is pretty well built-in now. There's almost pretty well nothing we can do about it." Former

<|startofarticle|>  The SNP's Pete Wishart told the PA there was a 'real danger' that Labour could be held back from a Brexit deal after it emerged Boris Johnson's former aide was accused of having sex with a senior Tory at work. SNP deputy leader Pete Wishart asked the PM to explain his colleagues' actions. The SNP is demanding that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) face a) bringing a criminal case against the parties and b) pursuing justice for victims of the December 15 event. In a letter to the CPS, Mr Williamson said: "I am sorry that my actions had caused such great suffering and grief. "I am truly sorry for the suffering the people of this country experiences. "But this is not a time for complacency or for looking back, this is a time for clarity and for seeing that this was wrong and that this is a mistake." Mr Williamson is believed to have left No 10 without a vote after the vote on the No 10 bill was delayed by the pandemic. Brexiteers heckled the move when it was confirmed by the vote. Labour had been thought to be able to force a vote on the amendment after it was blocked by the SNP. But the party that had been the front-runner for the Labour leadership insisted it would be difficult to rewrite the rules in such a way as to prevent a Tory-led committee from taking up the issue. Mr Williamson had insisted that he had read the original amendment first, which said the government should "keep going with caution" after a report suggested doing no more would be "probably too risky". But the move had been expected after the second bout of lockdown in November. Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want a return to the bubble system in England - but accepted that it had to change                             'It's not working. It's not having the right framework. It's not being sure you're going to be sure for a while. When you get used to it, then you'll have to go back' - Mrs Zahawi told the Mirror as she told the public how her organisation was losing members An education secretary has joined a growing chorus of anger at claims her organisation was being "dragged kicking and screaming" to get its Â£20-a-week pay cut. National Education Union general secretary Paul Whiteman told the Mirror: "It's not working. "We cannot have an education system that is rigged against us. "We cannot have an education system that expects teachers to do the right thing when they are stressed and stressed." He added: "We also need a proper education system that is tuned for the different children that are coming into our school."' This is not a pay cut for actors or politicians,' said Labour's deputy leader, Asma Jahmandu, who said the pay cut was a "shameful" event. 'It's not even close. It's not even close,' she said. 'It's not a pay cut for actors or politicians. It's not even close.' Ms Jandy was brought in as a Â£20-a-week, state-funded teacher in the fall of 2019 to win over the under-18s and help run the learning process for the whole family. But after they had finished, she said, "they told themselves it was fine, it was just a matter of time before they got to where they are today. "Now they feel like they are entitled to more pay, more control and more dissatisfaction with the way things were before." Last week, the BBC's news editor said that the BBC was witnessing the "end of story support" for a dramatic cut in funding which had saved Britain's flagship channel Â£20 a week. The cut, planned for this week, will hit around 10million people least able to work. And it will hit low-paid and insecure work. Ms Jandy said that "only" 8.3% of people who will be affected by the cut are in the state pension, while 6.8% are in the lower income group. She added: "At the moment, the lion's share of that money is going to be going to the NHS. "The only way that will change is if the Government brings in a real structural change which means that you can expect to see the funding for that is going to be created not through the Department but through the Treasury." Labour has suggested that leaving state pension levels relatively stable over the next decade would be a "stepping stone" to a more permanent uplift. Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  The SNP's Pete Wishart told the Commons it was 'cash for honours 2.0' as he confirmed he had submitted a formal complaint to the Met The SNP has made a formal complaint to the Metropolitan Police over claims the Tories awarded peerages to donors who gave millions to the party. SNP Commons Leader Pete Wishart asked Scotland Yard to investigate whether the "cash for peerages" allegations were in breach of the law. Boris Johnson's party has been accused of abusing the honours system by giving seats in the Lords to a select group of donors who each donated large sums to the party. An investigation found that eight of the nine last Tory main treasurers had been offered peerages - with each of those appointed since 2014 donating at least Â£3m. In his letter to the Met, Mr Wishart wrote that the allegations were "deeply undermining public trust and confidence" and should be urgently investigated. He suggested the police should focus on whether Boris Johnson, his immediate predecessors as PM and Tory officials had breached the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925. It is the latest sleaze allegation levelled at Mr Johnson's Government in the wake of the Owen Paterson scandal which saw his personal ratings slump to their lowest ever level. The SNP was behind the original complaints to the Met Police in the cash for peerages scandal that rocked Tony Blair's government in 2006. Scotland Yard has been approached for comment but the Mirror understands that Met chief Dame Cressida Dick has assured a speedy response to the letter. Mr Wishart told the Commons it was "cash for honours 2.0", telling MPs the "price to get into the House of Lords has gone up from Â£1 million from New Labour to Â£3 million from the Conservatives". He added: "It now seems that nearly all the past treasures of the Conservative Party of later years are in that place, wearing their ermine, taking a part in the legislative decisions of this country. "The only characteristic they seem to have, the only defining feature that seems to get them a place in that House, is the fact they're able to give several million pounds to this Government." A government spokesman said: "Peerages reflect long-standing contributions to civic life and also a willingness to further contribute to public life as a legislator in the second chamber. "It is wrong to criticise individuals being honoured just because they have also chosen to support or donate to a political party. "Donations should be transparent, but that is not an excuse to knock people for broader philanthropy, enterprise and public service." Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi (C) and Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty (2L) pose at a news conference announcing the Government's Â£10 million funding round led by former Bank of England governor Mark Carney, as revealed by the Mirror, are among hundreds of thousands of schemes being furloughed or axed across the country Boris Johnson is under pressure to bring back billions of pounds of free school meals for pupils as the nation faces a new strain of the double-digit school attendance figures. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi will announce the funding round led by former Bank of England governor Mark Carney, which also included Â£20m from the EU, was launched today. It is under discussion by Boris Johnson that millions of children could be hit hardest by the second wave of the pandemic. Hundreds of schools across the country will be told to accept that they cannot expect to attend a face-to-face learning environment any time in the summer of 2024. So far only schools in London and Manchester have been told to accept this option. But a second school for 12-year-olds will be told to accept it on August 5. If they refuse to take it off then they will be subject to a Â£5,000 fine. If they do accept it and allow time for testing then it will be up to them to decide if they want to continue the schooling. But if they have already made this decision they will be asked to make another decision based on the data they gather. Personally I would not be sending out testing children anymore as it would not do any good for my health and the damage it did to my health would be too late. Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  The NHS data said pregnant women make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care as they urge mums-to-be to get vaccinated Pregnant women are being urged to get vaccinated as soon as they are pregnant, as fears of a new Covid surge in the UK soar. NHS data said the number of confirmed cases of the highly contagious new strain has quadrupled in the last six weeks, up to 2,323. But the number of women reporting cases is 26, down from 33, while the number of cases is 26 for every 100,000 people over the age of 60. The Government has urged women to get the jab as there are currently 14,389 cases of the highly contagious new strain in England. Mr Williamson said: "I'm delighted that the furlough rules have been followed. "But I fear that the virus is going to get even worse before we reach the peak of the wave which is already causing concern for millions." He stressed that women should "keep their distance" from children as they "can be infected while trying to carry on." But Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the Government would not "cancel" jabs. Ministers have insisted that there will be no "pre-departure" levels before July 19 which would mean travellers should be able to book their break now. But they have not said how that would work, with experts warning it would require more detail. One Government insider told the Mirror: "It would be premature to do this before the summer so far. We're looking at factors beyond the flu. "The winter. The uncertainty. The weather. We don't want that to happen before July 19." However, one Government insider told the Mirror: "The issue is not whether to keep the jab or not, it's whether you can get the vaccine." The spokesman said: "The committee is satisfied that there is evidence to suggest that returning to work should be a priority for this government. "However, we need to look at the evidence and say we can't afford to continue with the current arrangements." Experts will also issue a statement saying they are "satisfied" that the vaccination is "essential" for public health. But Mr Williamson said the SAGE report, which was delayed by the pandemic, meant that "it's not clear how the vaccine will be used in schools". He added: "It's not clear how the jabs will work in schools, and I'm not sure we should go back into lockdown again." Labour has suggested that the decision should have been made earlier because the pandemic makes it look as though vaccines will be available in schools from this week. Shadow education secretary Kate Green said: "The Government is failing to do its bit over children's lives during the pandemic. "Parents have been crying out for help and are now asking for it. The Government should be applauded for doing its bit, doing their bit, and letting us do our bit." Read More Read More

Fears the Government will "cancel" Christmas come as official figures show there were another 82,866 cases of Covid today, up more than 50% in the past week. Covid cases topped 80,000 for only the fourth time since the start of pandemic with the new Omicron variant up 50% in just 24 hours. The Government's scientific advisers said it was "almost certain" there were hundreds of thousands of new Omicron infections each day. Mr Javid warned there were "no guarantees" that Christmas gatherings would be able to go ahead as planned. The Government's SAGE committee of advisers has cautioned that hospitalisations could surge to between 3,000 and 10,000 a day unless urgent action is taken. The Health Secretary admitted that "everything is under review" after the grim assessment suggested that infections could reach two million by the end of the month. The Mirror has been told Boris Johnson has cleared his diary for tomorrow for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team. No10 said that the PM was in touch with his advisers and keeping abreast of the data, while the four nations of the UK met for a Cobra meeting on the situation. But - with just five days before families are due to gather for Christmas â€“ a source said there was no plans for a press conference tomorrow announcing any changes to restrictions. Mr Javid, 52, admitted that scientific advice warning of a possible a surge in hospital admissions from Omicron was worrying - and that he would be cutting down on hugs with his elderly mum. He suggested the Government could not rule out any new measures before Christmas, adding: "There are no guarantees in this pandemic. "At this point we just have to keep everything under review." Earlier, when asked to rule out tougher rules in the coming days, he said: "We are assessing the situation, it's very fast-moving. "We've seen with Omicron there's a lot that we still don't know about Omicron. That's the truth of the matter. The reality is there's a lot of uncertainty." But he admitted that it was "time to be more cautious" and the Government would do "what is necessary" to keep the public safe. The PM is believed to prefer the prospect of delaying restrictions until after Christmas - even though that could be too late for the NHS. Mr Javid's remarks will cause yet more outrage among Conservative backbenchers after almost 100 voted to block much milder restrictions last week. The PM - who has repeatedly insisted that Christmas will go ahead - is likely to face another huge Tory rebellion to push any changes through. The Government has said MPs would be asked to return to Parliament to vote if new restrictions are needed. One Tory rebel, senior MP Tobias Ellwood, said the Government had to improve its handling of the pandemic. "It's on the bus, off the bus. The economy stops then starts again. We can't continue doing that," he said. The speculation over new restrictions comes after experts warned there are likely already hundreds of thousands of new infections from Omicron every day. If even a small number of them ended up in hospital it could risk overwhelming the NHS. Of the 82,866 cases of Covid today these included 12,133 cases of Omicron, up from 10,059 the day before, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Deaths in England of people with the variant rose to 12, up from seven, while hospital admissions increased to 104, up from 85. Prof Stephen Reicher, a member of SAGE, said it was clear that Plan B measures alone would not stop the spiralling numbers of cases. He cautioned that waiting until after Christmas to act is "probably too late". Fellow SAGE member Professor Sir David Spiegelhalter said: "We can't wait for hospitalisations to go through the roof before we do something about it, because by then it's too late.

<|startofarticle|>  The Government has made clear it expects schools, in particular primaries, to be the very last thing that closes in the event of further restrictions  Education chiefs have insisted the final step out of lockdown in the UK will be a "gradual and incremental" transition. Labour has suggested that it would be harder than in the US where strict rules were followed at all times. Labour has also suggested that it would be more difficult than in the US where strict rules were followed at all times. Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner told MPs: "We've got to do something radical. We've got to do something radical in terms of curbs on a billion a year, which are broken every single day." She added: "I think it is very important that we don't just leave people to their devices, we have to make sure that we can get back to a reasonable standard of care." The Mirror understands that Boris Johnson is set to have to make a decision on his own after the dismissal of Catherine Dowden from her role as Sajid Javid's press secretary. Sources suggest that Mr Johnson is not expected to make a decision until after the summer break. Mr Dowden will remain at the Department as its new communications director, taking over responsibility for enforcing the rules on masks and overseeing the rollout to the large majority of older people. Dowden will move to make sure that children who are vulnerable to infection get the help they need, and that they are not forced to self-isolate. She said: "He's made a commitment that they will have to self-isolate. It's very important that we get that right." Health Secretary Sajid Javid is understood to be reluctant to make any more changes to the system, with some MPs suggesting that he should resign. A Health Secretary who has had a varied career in public health could be put in charge of any department. But Mr Javid's other jobs include whip at the Police and Crime Committee and bear in his power. Labour wants him to lead the force back into Government in 2019 after its landslide election victory last week. But Mr Javid faces internal divisions over rules for MPs to be split up into smaller committees to be more accountable rather than the usual wave of layoffs and consolidations that rocked previous Tory governments. Some MPs are split over the PM's plans for the Online Safety Bill, including Keir Starmer who wants to keep the Â£20-a-week uplift until the Tories back it. Mr Starmer said last week: "We've got to do what is necessary to keep the internet safe, and that is affordable." He added: "The Government can't tell us when the next stage of the UK's roadmap we can follow is, we need to know right now. "The Prime Minister has been too busy trying to appease members of his own party who have been determined to put an early end to the 16-year-rule on which we were all raised." But Mr Starmer was unable to say whether Labour would back Labour's strategy of suppressing any opposition Labour has to cling onto the "red wall" in the wake of the Owen Paterson scandal. The Labour leader did say that the "red wall" would be shuttered "if there was a moment where that happened" - and that the "price to get into government was right". Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want a return to the bubble system in England - but accepted compulsory face coverings in class could make a comeback Secondary school pupils could be told to wear face-masks in school once again to keep Covid at bay this winter, the Education Secretary has admitted. Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want to see the return of bubbles where whole classes or year groups were sent home after a positive test. But he admitted that compulsory face-masks in lessons could make a come-back if cases spike. "I've got a contingency plan, as you would expect me to do. It contains lots of contingencies, including masks, absolutely," he told Sky News. The mandatory wearing of face coverings in schools and colleges was scrapped in May, but Government guidance says that directors of public health could advise schools to reintroduce them if cases spike. It comes after Government figures showed the number of children out of school for Covid-19 related reasons in England increased by two thirds in a fortnight. The DfE estimates that 2.5% of all pupils - more than 204,000 children - were not in class for reasons connected to coronavirus on Thursday last week. This is up from 122,300 children, or 1.5% of all pupils, on September 16 - a 67% rise from two weeks ago. Mr Zahawi also defended the slow rollout of carbon dioxide monitors which were first promised by the Department for Education in August. In Wales, secondary school and college pupils will be advised to take daily lateral flow tests for seven days if someone in their household tests positive for coronavirus, the Welsh Government has announced. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Zahawi said he was concerned about the impact Covid-19 measures had on attendance. He said: "The good news is that - and thanks to the brilliant teachers and support staff and parents and children - 99% of schools are open. "Attendance has gone up, the last set of figures I looked at was about 90%, which obviously will fluctuate depending on infection rates. "But my priority is to protect education, keep those schools open." But he said he was not looking to return to the bubble system to do so, "because actually, you saw the fall off in attendance which really does harm mental wellbeing, mental health of children". That is despite Englnad's schools previously being told backup plans must "cover the possibility that in some local areas it may become necessary to reintroduce 'bubbles' for a temporary period, to reduce mixing between groups. "Any decision to recommend the reintroduction of 'bubbles' would not be taken lightly and would need to take account of the detrimental impact they can have on the delivery of education."

<|startofarticle|>  Shadow schools minister Peter Kyle has said the Government needs to "don't talk to us" and the NAHT proposal to toughen sanctions against the EU for failing to tackle the pandemic  People are "reluctantly now" refusing to support a toughened sanctions regime for Russia after it breaches our elections. Ministers have downplayed suggestions that Tory MPs are prepared to support the toughened sanctions measures if the numbers of Scots who fail to meet the minimum standards imposed on them rise. Ahead of the debate, he said: "Ministers tell us that we can't afford not to do what we are doing. "They are deliberately putting us off." Mr Kyle added: "The truth is that we are absolutely desperate. "We have got to find a way in which we can continue to raise our voice and express support for our economic recovery in Scotland." The NAHT proposal is part of a package of economic and security plans the Government is expected to announce on Thursday. But it is understood to be the only way the Government will be able to afford the cost of doing so. A No 10 insider said: "It's a very good plan. It will save us Â£20bn a year and it will help us cope in a world that is nutritious and safe." She added: "It is not a plan that we will be able to afford. We are going to be paid Â£2.5bn a year. We are not going to be able to afford it. We are going to lose Â£9bn a year." The shadow business secretary has faced internal criticism over the lengths she has gone to ensure the Tories do not lose a Commons seat in 2019. She has also faced calls to ditch her predecessor's leadership after the party's devastating defeat in last week's by-election. But Ms Rayner said she would not quit if Labour loses the crucial by-election, where Kim Leadbeater, the Labour leader in the North Shropshire, loses. "If business people don't like our economy, we will not accept that and we will defend our seats according to our heart and will take action if we have to," she said. She said she remained committed to the following: "We will not resign if we don't get it right - including being extra-brief about what happened in the House of Lords." Labour has published the full text of its new charter as "Tories pledge to clean up politics" as it emerged from talks with the US President. It said the group wants "to clean up politics" and promised "a fresh start" for the Labour leadership. Mr Starmer has been rebuked by the party for a short address at the party conference in Brighton. But Ms Rayner insisted he would not be meeting that target expected to be reached after the party conference in the wake of the Owen Paterson scandal. "I don't think it's going to happen here. I think it's going to be a series of smaller, incremental steps that we can take here," he said. "And I'll be taking responsibility for them." He said that while he hoped to persuade the PM to back Labour, there was "not enough political capital" to go round" from the election. "He's not going to get a gander from the people who are actually supporting him. He's going to get his foot in their door." Mr Starmer has faced internal criticism over his leadership of the campaign to oust Tory MP Owen Paterson amid claims that he was trying to gain a grip on the party. After the party was accused of "scaremongering" about the situation in Northern Ireland last week, he said he had a "four-point plan" to deliver answers. He said: "It's not about personnel, it's not because it's Jeremy Corbyn, it's about our democracy. "No, I don't. I think it's about our democracy, it's about our democracy comes from a core value of the British people have asked for and deserve to know that the Government is serious about protecting it." But he rejected claims that he isjointly donated to the Labour Party by Sir Geoffrey, who has written an open letter calling for the Red Wall to be dug more deeply into the events of last week, and that the financial support given to the party has gone to the cause. "No, I don't. I think that's not true," he said. "The only reason that money is being given to the Labour Party is because of which Labour people deserve it." However, he was unable to rule out that a Labour-related scandal may break out as a result of the probe. "There will be a consequence," he said. "We've seen what happened with the pandemic and with outside donations. "I don't think it's going to be in the cards any time soon." He said that while he thinks of Labour as "a Government that is above the ordinary people", and that the Government is "not necessarily a Cabinet Office"

The PM - who has repeatedly insisted that Christmas will go ahead - is likely to face another huge Tory rebellion to push any changes through. The Government has said MPs would be asked to return to Parliament to vote if new restrictions are needed. One Tory rebel, senior MP Tobias Ellwood, said the Government had to improve its handling of the pandemic. "It's on the bus, off the bus. The economy stops then starts again. We can't continue doing that," he said. The speculation over new restrictions comes after experts warned there are likely already hundreds of thousands of new infections from Omicron every day. If even a small number of them ended up in hospital it could risk overwhelming the NHS. Of the 82,866 cases of Covid today these included 12,133 cases of Omicron, up from 10,059 the day before, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Deaths in England of people with the variant rose to 12, up from seven, while hospital admissions increased to 104, up from 85. Prof Stephen Reicher, a member of SAGE, said it was clear that Plan B measures alone would not stop the spiralling numbers of cases. He cautioned that waiting until after Christmas to act is "probably too late". Fellow SAGE member Professor Sir David Spiegelhalter said: "We can't wait for hospitalisations to go through the roof before we do something about it, because by then it's too late. "In fact what happens by the end of this year is pretty well built-in now. There's almost pretty well nothing we can do about it." Former

<|startofarticle|>  The Mirror has been told that Boris Johnson has cleared his diary today for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team, while Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned there are 'no guarantees' Christmas gatherings will be able to go ahead  Boris Johnson has cleared his diary for tomorrow for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team. No10 said that the Prime Minister was in touch with his advisers and keeping abreast of the data. But he has also asked his top team to prepare a strategy to avoid a hard border with the South Africa strain and to help prevent cases from spreading across the continent. Mr Johnson told Sky News: "ivorycraft" was a "better" measure of what is needed now. "It's not enough to say Christmas is here. You have to do something. "So, if there is a problem, what is the solution? What is the message? "It's not enough to say 'we're not sure this is it. We need to do more', it is possible to go further and to say 'we know that this is a long road'. "Poverty is a virus, it affects people differently than most people realise." Prof Sharad Pawar, deputy chair of the British Medical Association, said: "We know that when we make infections worse, people will turn against us. "We have to do more." Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the Government's failure to address the pandemic in "cautious enough" ways had "days, not hours", of delaying the vaccines roll-out. He told the Mirror: "It's a mess. We have got hours, not days, to get this sorted out. "The sense in the House is that the PM lacks the political will to do this. He lacks the political will to do this. He lacks a mandate to do this." The Government's own Covid priority list includes "Only Priority One," saying it would be "premature" to book summer breaks. Mr Johnson told the Mirror: "What we don't know is exactly how busy Priority 1 and Priority 3 will be, and how quickly those breaks will be available. "We have already spent Â£1.7 billion and - very significant given the speed of the vaccine rollout - we have enough to get everyone out of the country." But Mr Johnson said he was "not sure" where the Â£10 billion needed was.

<|startofarticle|>  The Mirror has been told that Boris Johnson has cleared his diary today for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team, while Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned there are 'no guarantees' Christmas gatherings will be able to go ahead  Boris Johnson has cleared his diary for tomorrow for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team. No10 said that the Prime Minister had "very much" expected the vaccines to roll out to the over-80s, but that they needed to be "stretched a bit more" to allow for the "easier" rollout to the over-18s. He has also confirmed that Dame Cressida will be asked to appear at the G7 summit in Cornwall. If she agrees to hold talks with the US and EU over her plans. Mr Johnson has said he wants "to see what can be done" to help the vaccine roll-out. The Prime Minister said he was "very much looking at" the issue and that he had "strong plans" to do so. There are now also plans for the PM to hold a "big bang" test on 12 million vaccine doses in the autumn. The Government has also axed restrictions on free movement for scientific advice and officials will be allowed to treat their staff "as friends and not as rivals". No 10 said it was "very serious" about the protocols. Labour "Jo Stevens has done a really good job at avoiding being branded 'Covid-19'," Mr Johnson told Sky News. "These are big decisions affecting everyone's lives, it's affecting everybody's livelihoods. "The PM is right to want to have the technology. He is wrong to turn away from the opportunity to roll out a vaccine. We need a new beginning." The Government has already spent almost Â£300bn on coronavirus measures â€“ a third of that in England. The PM wants to ensure everyone has the vaccine as soon as they are permitted, even if they want to have it. He said the Government could not rule out a "vaccular" moment when case rates soar. "At this point we don't know if that will happen," he said. "At the moment we are in a position where we can immunise millions, we can't immunise just any way." But he said the need to vaccinate millions "wasn't decided at this point". Sajid Javid, the chair of the British Medical Association, said: "The Government is advising the public to meet outdoors where possible, and to wear masks in crowded indoor spaces. "We have got to proceed with caution. We have got to proceed with caution." He said that when people first get used to the new measures, they are likely to relax. "They may stop now, that's fine, but now is the time to let our minds go open to the world outside". And he said he hoped there would be no need to continue wearing them indoors in the autumn. The PM will tell the packed House of Commonss this week that he is "happy to say" he has backed the concept of wearing masks in "structurally sound" spaces. The Government has also axed restrictions on community gatherings, banned the wearing of face coverings in hospitals and set up coronavirus "prevention" units to be set up in each community to deal with any new restrictions. No 10 said that the proposals would be "modest" and did not intend to change the existing units. However, Labour has said that the proposals "wouldn't make any sense" and would "moderately" reduce the number of coronavirus deaths. The Mirror understands that Health Secretary Sajid Javid will be asked to explain his colleagues' decision to keep wearing masks in Parliament. He will then have to agree to help Mr Johnson with his own plans for mask taxes, which he has negotiated. The Government has already spent almost Â£300m on coronavirus units, while the Treasury will have to agree to a total increase of Â£96m. The PM's spokesman said: "The Government has been mired in escalating scandals for years with no accountability and with increasing public frustration." Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want a return to the bubble system in England - but accepted compulsory face coverings in class could make a comeback Secondary school pupils could be told to wear face-masks in school once again to keep Covid at bay this winter, the Education Secretary has admitted. Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want to see the return of bubbles where whole classes or year groups were sent home after a positive test. But he admitted that compulsory face-masks in lessons could make a come-back if cases spike. "I've got a contingency plan, as you would expect me to do. It contains lots of contingencies, including masks, absolutely," he told Sky News. The mandatory wearing of face coverings in schools and colleges was scrapped in May, but Government guidance says that directors of public health could advise schools to reintroduce them if cases spike. It comes after Government figures showed the number of children out of school for Covid-19 related reasons in England increased by two thirds in a fortnight. The DfE estimates that 2.5% of all pupils - more than 204,000 children - were not in class for reasons connected to coronavirus on Thursday last week. This is up from 122,300 children, or 1.5% of all pupils, on September 16 - a 67% rise from two weeks ago. Mr Zahawi also defended the slow rollout of carbon dioxide monitors which were first promised by the Department for Education in August. In Wales, secondary school and college pupils will be advised to take daily lateral flow tests for seven days if someone in their household tests positive for coronavirus, the Welsh Government has announced. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Zahawi said he was concerned about the impact Covid-19 measures had on attendance. He said: "The good news is that - and thanks to the brilliant teachers and support staff and parents and children - 99% of schools are open. "Attendance has gone up, the last set of figures I looked at was about 90%, which obviously will fluctuate depending on infection rates. "But my priority is to protect education, keep those schools open." But he said he was not looking to return to the bubble system to do so, "because actually, you saw the fall off in attendance which really does harm mental wellbeing, mental health of children". That is despite Englnad's schools previously being told backup plans must "cover the possibility that in some local areas it may become necessary to reintroduce 'bubbles' for a temporary period, to reduce mixing between groups. "Any decision to recommend the reintroduction of 'bubbles' would not be taken lightly and would need to take account of the detrimental impact they can have on the delivery of education."

The Mirror understands Boris Johnson is set to have urgent meetings tomorrow with scientists and his top team. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned there are "no guarantees" Christmas gatherings will be able to go ahead. It comes days after Mr Johnson assured the public the Government will not "cancel" Christmas. Measures on the table include a ban on households mixing and the closure of indoor hospitality venues and non-essential shops within days. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has failed to rule out a circuit breaker lockdown in England before Christmas to cut pressure on the NHS. Fears the Government will "cancel" Christmas come as official figures show there were another 82,866 cases of Covid today, up more than 50% in the past week. Covid cases topped 80,000 for only the fourth time since the start of pandemic with the new Omicron variant up 50% in just 24 hours. The Government's scientific advisers said it was "almost certain" there were hundreds of thousands of new Omicron infections each day. Mr Javid warned there were "no guarantees" that Christmas gatherings would be able to go ahead as planned. The Government's SAGE committee of advisers has cautioned that hospitalisations could surge to between 3,000 and 10,000 a day unless urgent action is taken.

Earlier, when asked to rule out tougher rules in the coming days, he said: "We are assessing the situation, it's very fast-moving.

NHS data said the pregnant women make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care. Officials fear that the vaccine backlog is holding back deliveries. More than 32,000 Covid patients are now in intensive care with some dying in hospital. Ministers warned it would be "premature" to book summer breaks as Covid case rates soar across Europe. Downing Street said it "hoped and indeed expected" the vaccine would make a "emergency" decision as it was "heavy handed" and might not reflect the new regulations. No 10 said: "We're taking steps backwards that could mean that they [the Cabinet Office] don't like it." Mr Johnson told Sky News: "The decision last week to not vaccinate pregnant women was a result of weeks of consideration not months. "It is very important that pregnant women are having their second dose and that is really the message to pregnant women that we need to get that out of the pregnancy." He added: "We will, we will also want to want to want to be very wary about the development in India of releasing highly infectious variants that can be very dangerous."

<|startofarticle|>  The Prime Minister raised the cricket tournament with Aussie PM Scott Morrison over dinner in Washington DC Hopes of the Ashes going ahead this winter have risen after Boris Johnson revealed he had asked the Aussie PM to find a way round strict Covid rules. The Prime Minister raised the cricket tournament with Scott Morrison over dinner in Washington DC on Tuesday night. England's players are concerned about Australia 's strict coronavirus protocols and there are particular issues surrounding whether or not their families will be able to join them in Australia. The Ashes is due to kick off in December with five matches played over the following two months around Australia, which has virtually closed its borders to foreign nationals. Mr Johnson told reporters: "I raised it and he said he was going to do his best for the families. " "He totally got the point that the cricketers, it's very tough to ask people be away from their families for so long over Christmas." But Mr Morrison did not agree to set up a travel taskforce or to consider allowing all double jabbed Brits to enter the country. The PM added: "He merely undertook to go away and come back with a solution if he could find one". Several England players could face up to four months without seeing their loved ones if they play at both the T20 World Cup and the Ashes. Jos Buttler, for example, last month said he could not rule out the prospect of skipping the series, having already pulled out of the IPL after his wife gave birth to their second child. He told the Sunday Times: "One of the challenges is working out where the line is where you say I can't do that. I've sacrificed a lot for cricket and my wife and family have sacrificed a lot. "You have to be open to saying no. It would be incredibly disappointing if some players feel like they can't do it, but we're in a world at the moment where that is a possibility." Stuart Broad, meanwhile, has committed himself to the tour, saying he is "happy to get on a plane to Australia". James Anderson has also said he is willing to go, revealing that his family "have already said they are not going to Australia" and admitting that the situation is "easier" for him as he only plays Test cricket. Speaking on the Wisden Cricket Weekly podcast, Butcher called for all of England's players to commit themselves to the Ashes. "I'm slightly furious about the idea that players are thinking about not going on an Ashes tour because they're worried about the quarantine requirements for their wives and kids," he said. "Now, wives and kids going on trips in my time was very much a privilege, it wasn't expected. "I know times have changed a lot but given that everybody is having to make various sacrifices, lots of sacrifices, lots of things are different because of Covidâ€¦ "This is a one-off Ashes trip. Chances are, the next time it comes around, four years' time, every thing will be relatively back to normal and you'll have your families there for Christmas and all the rest of it. "But this is your job. This is how you earn your money."

We can't continue doing that," he said. The speculation over new restrictions comes after experts warned there are likely already hundreds of thousands of new infections from Omicron every day. If even a small number of them ended up in hospital it could risk overwhelming the NHS. Of the 82,866 cases of Covid today these included 12,133 cases of Omicron, up from 10,059 the day before, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Deaths in England of people with the variant rose to 12, up from seven, while hospital admissions increased to 104, up from 85. Prof Stephen Reicher, a member of SAGE, said it was clear that Plan B measures alone would not stop the spiralling numbers of cases. He cautioned that waiting until after Christmas to act is "probably too late". Fellow SAGE member Professor Sir David Spiegelhalter said: "We can't wait for hospitalisations to go through the roof before we do something about it, because by then it's too late. "In fact what happens by the end of this year is pretty well built-in now. There's almost pretty

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi (C) and Justice Secretary Robert Buckland (2nd L) look at evidence during the daylong debate as they claimed the Government's flagship justice package did not do enough to end violence against women â€™s death threats Just one week into the biggest Commons Commons Commons debate on the treatment of women, the fate of victims of violent crime has been left in women. After months of flailing about the issue, No 10 finally appears to have learned the lesson of the last 18 months and not only has it again failed to provide sufficient support for women who have been threatened with violence, but also failed to provide the resources and support required to get a conviction. The Mirror revealed earlier this week that the number of women convicted of crimes such as rape, attempted rape, stalking and domestic murder has gone up by 53% in a year. Just a third of victims are male, with just over 10% of the population. The record low conviction rates across all age groups means that victims are often left feeling unsafe. "There is no doubt that this has affected the way women are perceived by the police and courts. "The fear of repeat offenders is not helping the rate of crime increase." Ms Rayner said: "The fear of women going back to being stalked, battered and murdered is unfounded. "We know that to be wrong and we will take decisive action to fix it. "But I fear that this report does nothing to deal with the root causes of crime and sexual violence, and we will never get a grip on the force that has been broken by this pandemic." She added: "The only way we can get a grip on this is by talking about the solutions we can already do for women." Labour has proposed two measures - one to toughen sentences for rape and murder and the other to crack down on the practice - but the Government has not said how to deal with the extra risk of new variants. Ms Rayner said: "The Government has been absolutely clear that this is a new approach to dealing with violence against women. "We don't want it to be rape but it does raise some questions. "For one thing, do they want to punish women in this way they cannot control their impulses? And again, do they not want to punish men in this way they cannot control their impulses? "Or do they not want to punish women in this way they cannot control their impulses? "We have seen what is happening with the police and courts is happening with the public. We have seen what is happening with the Government's own crime bill." The Government has announced plans for porn sites to be banned from their sites and online spaces to help keep women safe. But ministers face growing criticism for not doing more to close down the internet and for imposing stronger restrictions before the next election. They have claimed that doing so would "increase the effectiveness" of the blocking system, adding: "We will not put up with this." But at a Downing Street briefing, No 10 insiders claimed that No 10 was not clear how the Government will deal with the surge in illegal porn on the internet. They suggested that the security of the internet was "not a priority" for ministers - and that there was no plan to speed up the ban on porn on British soil. Mr Johnson told the Commons at Prime Minister's Questions: "The absolutely vital thing is that we can get a grip on this, and we can get a grip on this quickly enough." He said that the crisis on women's safety had become "fantastic and serious" and said the police should be asked to look at whether porn sites are hosting child pornography. The PM also said the "epidemic" of violence against women was not a "military concept". He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: "There were a number of measures taken in the manifesto that are working. We have to take a harder approach than ever we have in the last 20 months." He added: "I know that is very important to recognise, but we have got a very serious epidemic on our hands that needs to be addressed." Mr Johnson told the BBC's Newscast: "I said on the day that I was elected (Labour leader) that we had a plan for fighting the virus and tackling violence against women. "There is no plan, we have got to tackle the problem head on." He insisted that Labour had "not won" the battle over violence against women and girls since the Tories came into power. "They have lost the battle over police, it's very important to us, the very definition of elite," he said. "This party has lost the battle over police, it's very important to us. "We have lost the battle over a manifesto commitment, it's very important to us." But Mr Johnson's no-onsense approach to the pandemic row has exposed the deep divisions within the party on issues including tax rises, defence and foreign policy. Labour is now the only party that has lost the battle over the

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want a return to the bubble system in England - but accepted compulsory face coverings in class could make a comeback Secondary school pupils could be told to wear face-masks in school once again to keep Covid at bay this winter, the Education Secretary has admitted. Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want to see the return of bubbles where whole classes or year groups were sent home after a positive test. But he admitted that compulsory face-masks in lessons could make a come-back if cases spike. "I've got a contingency plan, as you would expect me to do. It contains lots of contingencies, including masks, absolutely," he told Sky News. The mandatory wearing of face coverings in schools and colleges was scrapped in May, but Government guidance says that directors of public health could advise schools to reintroduce them if cases spike. It comes after Government figures showed the number of children out of school for Covid-19 related reasons in England increased by two thirds in a fortnight. The DfE estimates that 2.5% of all pupils - more than 204,000 children - were not in class for reasons connected to coronavirus on Thursday last week. This is up from 122,300 children, or 1.5% of all pupils, on September 16 - a 67% rise from two weeks ago. Mr Zahawi also defended the slow rollout of carbon dioxide monitors which were first promised by the Department for Education in August. In Wales, secondary school and college pupils will be advised to take daily lateral flow tests for seven days if someone in their household tests positive for coronavirus, the Welsh Government has announced. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Zahawi said he was concerned about the impact Covid-19 measures had on attendance. He said: "The good news is that - and thanks to the brilliant teachers and support staff and parents and children - 99% of schools are open. "Attendance has gone up, the last set of figures I looked at was about 90%, which obviously will fluctuate depending on infection rates. "But my priority is to protect education, keep those schools open." But he said he was not looking to return to the bubble system to do so, "because actually, you saw the fall off in attendance which really does harm mental wellbeing, mental health of children". That is despite Englnad's schools previously being told backup plans must "cover the possibility that in some local areas it may become necessary to reintroduce 'bubbles' for a temporary period, to reduce mixing between groups. "Any decision to recommend the reintroduction of 'bubbles' would not be taken lightly and would need to take account of the detrimental impact they can have on the delivery of education."

<|startofarticle|>  The SNP's Pete Wishart told the Commons it was 'cash for honours 2.0' as he confirmed he had submitted a formal complaint to the Met The SNP has made a formal complaint to the Metropolitan Police over claims the Tories awarded peerages to donors who gave millions to the party. SNP Commons Leader Pete Wishart asked Scotland Yard to investigate whether the "cash for peerages" allegations were in breach of the law. Boris Johnson's party has been accused of abusing the honours system by giving seats in the Lords to a select group of donors who each donated large sums to the party. An investigation found that eight of the nine last Tory main treasurers had been offered peerages - with each of those appointed since 2014 donating at least Â£3m. In his letter to the Met, Mr Wishart wrote that the allegations were "deeply undermining public trust and confidence" and should be urgently investigated. He suggested the police should focus on whether Boris Johnson, his immediate predecessors as PM and Tory officials had breached the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925. It is the latest sleaze allegation levelled at Mr Johnson's Government in the wake of the Owen Paterson scandal which saw his personal ratings slump to their lowest ever level. The SNP was behind the original complaints to the Met Police in the cash for peerages scandal that rocked Tony Blair's government in 2006. Scotland Yard has been approached for comment but the Mirror understands that Met chief Dame Cressida Dick has assured a speedy response to the letter. Mr Wishart told the Commons it was "cash for honours 2.0", telling MPs the "price to get into the House of Lords has gone up from Â£1 million from New Labour to Â£3 million from the Conservatives". He added: "It now seems that nearly all the past treasures of the Conservative Party of later years are in that place, wearing their ermine, taking a part in the legislative decisions of this country. "The only characteristic they seem to have, the only defining feature that seems to get them a place in that House, is the fact they're able to give several million pounds to this Government." A government spokesman said: "Peerages reflect long-standing contributions to civic life and also a willingness to further contribute to public life as a legislator in the second chamber. "It is wrong to criticise individuals being honoured just because they have also chosen to support or donate to a political party. "Donations should be transparent, but that is not an excuse to knock people for broader philanthropy, enterprise and public service." Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  Shadow schools minister Peter Kyle has said ministers should "reopen" discussions with the jabs experts to explain the delay on whether to approve vaccines for 12 to 15-year-olds Ministers are being warned that schools will become a "cauldron of Covid" unless heads get more support to avoid further disruption this autumn. Labour wants schools to have more flexibility over whether children wear masks in class or 'bubbles' are asked to self-isolate at home in the event of an outbreak. Vaccines chiefs also face pressure to speed up their decision to approve jabs for 12 to 15-year-olds to prevent another wave of infection. Shadow schools minister Peter Kyle told the Mirror that ministers should "reopen" discussions with the jabs experts to explain the delay. Millions of younger children in the United States and across Europe are already getting jabbed. School leaders and teaching unions have warned that heads have been left without sufficient tools to manage any Covid outbreak in their schools. The Government scrapped the measures at the end of last term after hundreds of thousands of children were forced to miss class. They handed over responsibility for testing and tracing to the failed Government scheme. Mr Kyle said: "Next week, because of Government scrapping mitigation measures and the failure to vaccinate they have created a situation where schools will be a cauldron of Covid. "This is so serious that if Covid does not tear through our school system in the autumn term, then it's acting in a different way than it has been over the last 18 months." The Labour MP questioned how medicines' regulator the MHRA could declare the Pfizer vaccine safe for young teenagers but the JCVI delay in recommending it. Ministers have asked the NHS to start preparing for the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines to all children aged 12 to 15 from September, pending approval. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has already delayed taking part in the testing of over-12s, although he has said there will be a back-up plan for those who want to participate in the testing. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has already delayed taking part in the testing of children aged 12 to 15 as the number of cases of the new Covid vaccine increases. Ministers have also suggested that senior civil servants will not be asked to attend the Defence-row quiz and Government sources admit that of the 18- to 15-year-olds quizzed this term, only one was selected. Mr Kyle said that Health Secretary Sajid Javid should "reopen" discussions with the JCVI about allowing young people back in on the island. He tweeted: "If ministers want to allow young people back in on #JCVI they have to ask." The Government has promised that the end of school unions' strike action in 2022. As recently as September, members of both unions and the government had been at loggerheads over the exact wording of the Government's UC strike action plan. It was then revealed that ministers had decided to keep the plan unchanged after a 10-day public vote. But Mr Kyle suggested that a new, tougher UC strike action plan should be brought forward as a "once in a lifetime opportunity" for employers. He said: "If you want to be a leader on that front you have got to be prepared to face all of the challenges ahead." But Labour is concerned that the UC plan could make it impossible for companies to offer younger workers more flexible working arrangements. "The UC system is broken. It's failing to even make it through with UC because of the pandemic. "If they're going to make it, they have to make it before the pandemic." Mark Harper, Labour's shadow Financial Secretary to the Treasury, said: "The Conservatives have spent the last decade undermining workers' rights, undermining the very foundations of employment, and absolutely cannot produce a decent, secure, secure future for our country. "They have failed to keep their promise to British workers and their aspirations, and they have failed to do a right by workers and their families over the next few years." BBC director-general Tim Davie has already said that the union movement is "struggling to build a voice in this country" and is "struggling to this day to express our dissatisfaction".

<|startofarticle|>  The Mirror has been told that Boris Johnson has cleared his diary today for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team, while Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned there are 'no guarantees' Christmas gatherings will be able to go ahead Tougher restrictions may be imposed in England next week as Covid infections soar. The Mirror understands Boris Johnson is set to have urgent meetings tomorrow with scientists and his top team. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned there are "no guarantees" Christmas gatherings will be able to go ahead. It comes days after Mr Johnson assured the public the Government will not "cancel" Christmas. Measures on the table include a ban on households mixing and the closure of indoor hospitality venues and non-essential shops within days. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has failed to rule out a circuit breaker lockdown in England before Christmas to cut pressure on the NHS. Fears the Government will "cancel" Christmas come as official figures show there were another 82,866 cases of Covid today, up more than 50% in the past week. Covid cases topped 80,000 for only the fourth time since the start of pandemic with the new Omicron variant up 50% in just 24 hours. The Government's scientific advisers said it was "almost certain" there were hundreds of thousands of new Omicron infections each day. Mr Javid warned there were "no guarantees" that Christmas gatherings would be able to go ahead as planned. The Government's SAGE committee of advisers has cautioned that hospitalisations could surge to between 3,000 and 10,000 a day unless urgent action is taken. The Health Secretary admitted that "everything is under review" after the grim assessment suggested that infections could reach two million by the end of the month. The Mirror has been told Boris Johnson has cleared his diary for tomorrow for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team. No10 said that the PM was in touch with his advisers and keeping abreast of the data, while the four nations of the UK met for a Cobra meeting on the situation. But - with just five days before families are due to gather for Christmas â€“ a source said there was no plans for a press conference tomorrow announcing any changes to restrictions. Mr Javid, 52, admitted that scientific advice warning of a possible a surge in hospital admissions from Omicron was worrying - and that he would be cutting down on hugs with his elderly mum. He suggested the Government could not rule out any new measures before Christmas, adding: "There are no guarantees in this pandemic. "At this point we just have to keep everything under review." Earlier, when asked to rule out tougher rules in the coming days, he said: "We are assessing the situation, it's very fast-moving. "We've seen with Omicron there's a lot that we still don't know about Omicron. That's the truth of the matter. The reality is there's a lot of uncertainty." But he admitted that it was "time to be more cautious" and the Government would do "what is necessary" to keep the public safe. The PM is believed to prefer the prospect of delaying restrictions until after Christmas - even though that could be too late for the NHS. Mr Javid's remarks will cause yet more outrage among Conservative backbenchers after almost 100 voted to block much milder restrictions last week. The PM - who has repeatedly insisted that Christmas will go ahead - is likely to face another huge Tory rebellion to push any changes through.

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has confirmed that the final step out of lockdown could be reached by text or by mail. But Mr Kyle suggested the EHMA should reconsider its decision not to vaccinate over-12s who are still in contact with people who can receive them from their GP. "If they're not sending people into the virus, it's not because it's not mandated," he said. "It's because they're not with us, it's because they're not with us not having our vaccination." Some Department of Health officials believe the delay in recommending the vaccine is a sign the vaccine needs to be made more difficult. Dr Mary Bousted of the University of Strathclyde said: "This is a long-term trend. If you have symptoms of Covid, see a GP or have someone in your household who is having the virus." The HSE has received more than 62,000 complaints about vaccine hesitancy in recent weeks, with many relating to Covid. Many of the delays have been blamed for the soaring rates of Covid in schools. The HSE has received more than 62,000 complaints about vaccine hesitancy in recent weeks, with many relating to Covid. More than 86,000 people have now had their first dose and more than 62,000 have had their second. Many parents are opting not to have their children's first jab, with most opting to have their second delivered via a hospital frontage. Vaccine hesitancy in young people has decreased by 11% in the last year, with the figure for young people 30 to 39% . Former primary school teacher Rosie Winterton, who is advising children to get a Covid jab, said: "I think it is down to the virus not being able to carry the virus into your school. "If it's not vaccinated, it can get very, very busy." Health Secretary Matt Hancock urged people to take their Covid vaccine as it was "extremely unlikely" that there would be more schools provided the booster shot. He told MPs: "I think it is quite likely that we are going to have to leave the country. "Dr Murphy's comments are causing quite a stir. "It's quite true that we can leave the country, we can do whatever we want with as much as we want." However, Labour's Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green said: "While the Government has been warned off the continent, we do want to leave some flexibility in the rules so it's not just a matter of leaving England, it's also a matter of leaving Europe. "If you are wanted in the UK, you need a visa for that, and you need one for travel to and from the EU where you are wanted for something like this. "I think the Government is absolutely out of touch with the ordinary people who live and travel every day." But the Labour leader said the Government was "acting in accordance" with the law by deciding to ignore it. Mr Kyle said: "What I'm really concerned about is that they're not being followable by the police or the courts and are acting in accordance with the law."

<|startofarticle|>  The Mirror has been told that Boris Johnson has cleared his diary today for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team, while Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned there are 'no guarantees' Christmas gatherings will be able to go ahead Tougher restrictions may be imposed in England next week as Covid infections soar. The Mirror understands Boris Johnson is set to have urgent meetings tomorrow with scientists and his top team. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned there are "no guarantees" Christmas gatherings will be able to go ahead. It comes days after Mr Johnson assured the public the Government will not "cancel" Christmas. Measures on the table include a ban on households mixing and the closure of indoor hospitality venues and non-essential shops within days. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has failed to rule out a circuit breaker lockdown in England before Christmas to cut pressure on the NHS. Fears the Government will "cancel" Christmas come as official figures show there were another 82,866 cases of Covid today, up more than 50% in the past week. Covid cases topped 80,000 for only the fourth time since the start of pandemic with the new Omicron variant up 50% in just 24 hours. The Government's scientific advisers said it was "almost certain" there were hundreds of thousands of new Omicron infections each day. Mr Javid warned there were "no guarantees" that Christmas gatherings would be able to go ahead as planned. The Government's SAGE committee of advisers has cautioned that hospitalisations could surge to between 3,000 and 10,000 a day unless urgent action is taken. The Health Secretary admitted that "everything is under review" after the grim assessment suggested that infections could reach two million by the end of the month. The Mirror has been told Boris Johnson has cleared his diary for tomorrow for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team. No10 said that the PM was in touch with his advisers and keeping abreast of the data, while the four nations of the UK met for a Cobra meeting on the situation. But - with just five days before families are due to gather for Christmas â€“ a source said there was no plans for a press conference tomorrow announcing any changes to restrictions. Mr Javid, 52, admitted that scientific advice warning of a possible a surge in hospital admissions from Omicron was worrying - and that he would be cutting down on hugs with his elderly mum. He suggested the Government could not rule out any new measures before Christmas, adding: "There are no guarantees in this pandemic. "At this point we just have to keep everything under review." Earlier, when asked to rule out tougher rules in the coming days, he said: "We are assessing the situation, it's very fast-moving. "We've seen with Omicron there's a lot that we still don't know about Omicron. That's the truth of the matter. The reality is there's a lot of uncertainty." But he admitted that it was "time to be more cautious" and the Government would do "what is necessary" to keep the public safe. The PM is believed to prefer the prospect of delaying restrictions until after Christmas - even though that could be too late for the NHS. Mr Javid's remarks will cause yet more outrage among Conservative backbenchers after almost 100 voted to block much milder restrictions last week. The PM - who has repeatedly insisted that Christmas will go ahead - is likely to face another huge Tory rebellion to push any changes through. The Government has said MPs would be asked to return to Parliament to vote if new restrictions are needed. One Tory rebel, senior MP Tobias Ellwood, said the Government had to improve its handling of the pandemic. "It's on the bus, off the bus. The economy stops then starts again. We can't continue doing that," he said. The speculation over new restrictions comes after experts warned there are likely already hundreds of thousands of new infections from Omicron every day. If even a small number of them ended up in hospital it could risk overwhelming the NHS. Of the 82,866 cases of Covid today these included 12,133 cases of Omicron, up from 10,059 the day before, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Deaths in England of people with the variant rose to 12, up from seven, while hospital admissions increased to 104, up from 85. Prof Stephen Reicher, a member of SAGE, said it was clear that Plan B measures alone would not stop the spiralling numbers of cases. He cautioned that waiting until after Christmas to act is "probably too late". Fellow SAGE member Professor Sir David Spiegelhalter said: "We can't wait for hospitalisations to go through the roof before we do something about it, because by then it's too late. "In fact what happens by the end of this year is pretty well built-in now. There's almost pretty well nothing we can do about it." Former

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want a return to the bubble system in England - but accepted compulsory face coverings in class could make a comeback Secondary school pupils could be told to wear face-masks in school once again to keep Covid at bay this winter, the Education Secretary has admitted. Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want to see the return of bubbles where whole classes or year groups were sent home after a positive test. But he admitted that compulsory face-masks in lessons could make a come-back if cases spike. "I've got a contingency plan, as you would expect me to do. It contains lots of contingencies, including masks, absolutely," he told Sky News. The mandatory wearing of face coverings in schools and colleges was scrapped in May, but Government guidance says that directors of public health could advise schools to reintroduce them if cases spike. It comes after Government figures showed the number of children out of school for Covid-19 related reasons in England increased by two thirds in a fortnight. The DfE estimates that 2.5% of all pupils - more than 204,000 children - were not in class for reasons connected to coronavirus on Thursday last week. This is up from 122,300 children, or 1.5% of all pupils, on September 16 - a 67% rise from two weeks ago. Mr Zahawi also defended the slow rollout of carbon dioxide monitors which were first promised by the Department for Education in August. In Wales, secondary school and college pupils will be advised to take daily lateral flow tests for seven days if someone in their household tests positive for coronavirus, the Welsh Government has announced. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Zahawi said he was concerned about the impact Covid-19 measures had on attendance. He said: "The good news is that - and thanks to the brilliant teachers and support staff and parents and children - 99% of schools are open. "Attendance has gone up, the last set of figures I looked at was about 90%, which obviously will fluctuate depending on infection rates. "But my priority is to protect education, keep those schools open." But he said he was not looking to return to the bubble system to do so, "because actually, you saw the fall off in attendance which really does harm mental wellbeing, mental health of children". That is despite Englnad's schools previously being told backup plans must "cover the possibility that in some local areas it may become necessary to reintroduce 'bubbles' for a temporary period, to reduce mixing between groups. "Any decision to recommend the reintroduction of 'bubbles' would not be taken lightly and would need to take account of the detrimental impact they can have on the delivery of education."

<|startofarticle|>  The NHS data said pregnant women make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care as they urge mums-to-be to get vaccinated Pregnant women are being urged to get vaccinated as soon as they are offered the chance, according to figures. NHS data said the pregnant women make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care. Officials fear that infections from the new strain of the Red Wall virus are also on the rise, raising fears of a new Covid surge. Infections in hospitals have risen by more than 12,000 in the last month, with London Hospital's system dangerously overwhelmed. The chances of the NHS data link the soaring hospitalisations with the new strain which is expected to hit in May. Vaccination rates are expected to be even higher this week than they were last week, with cases expected in Bolton and Glasgow. The mood among women has been "satisfied" with their vaccination rates. Ministers have confirmed that the "board is open" to discussing jabs for the over-80s and "desires" of staff include being able to "stay at home". But ministers warned that the "economically illiterate" part of the population could be "burdened" by the soaring hospitalisations. Tory MP Philip Davies asked Health Secretary Sajid Javid : "Can you give me any reason at all why I shouldn't vaccinate my daughter?" He replied: "We can't eliminate the virus, we can try to protect people." Mr Javid said that as long as children who are contacts are not ill, they can continue to have contact. The Health Secretary was unable to say how many contacts there will be between teenagers and adults. Ministers have asked ministers to give them a "clear and present danger" to prevent more cases of the virus spreading across the country. Mr Javid said that as long as children who are contacts are not ill, they can continue to have contact. The Government is not currently recommending that people who can pass the jab be forced to isolate. But the PM is open to looking at the case fatality rules, which would mean that one in ten people who are forced to isolate will die. The rules for third countries are yet to be drawn, but the Government is believed to be interested in having them overturned. Mr Javid said that if the evidence were to show that a case was more likely to pop up than anywhere else, it would be "very worrying". The PM was not specific about when the changes would be made. Labour has published a policy paper setting out proposals to toughen sentences for offences such as failing to attend appointments, distributing vaccines without a vaccination, and failing to attend a meeting. Shadow justice secretary David Lammy said: "The Conservatives have spent the last decade undermining the NHS, stopping doors from being opened, and failing to protect our NHS. "It's unbelievable that, after so many years of neglect, this waste of time and money should finally be scrapped. "It's a truly shocking verdict on the part of the Prime Minister." Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves added: "The people of England should not have their healthcare disrupted while they are stuck in a Covid-19 pandemic. "The Prime Minister should apologise, and apologise now." Health Minister Helen Whatley also tweeted: "The Prime Minister should resign." Irish PM Micheal Martin said it was "cash for honours 2.0", and said it was an "abusers' charter" that would not be used. No 10 failed 19 times to correct the PM's false claim. Former international aid secretary Andrew Mitchell, who led the push for a U-turn at the time, said the move would be "frivolous" and illegal. And Scottish Government leader Keir Starmer said it was "cash for honours 2.0". Former international aid secretary Whatley Woodward said: "This is a woefully inadequate response given the scale of the UK's humanitarian crisis since the pandemic. "The Government is now short of funding for key areas where we can do more good, where we can provide additional support for the most desperate people." International development minister Nadhim Zahawi said: "The U-turn on the jab is a woefully inadequate step. "It's contrary to the most recent UK Government's position, which is that the UK will continue to provide essential assistance to those in need and we will continue to invest in the best means we can." Labour's Rachel Reeves said: "The hypocrisy from this Government is appalling. "It is total nonsense. "The Prime Minister said he was not cancelling the deliveries so we can have our best delivery in a pandemic zone. "Not only that, but he's right to cancel the deliveries as well." International development minister Nadhim Zahawi said: "This is a woefully inadequate step. "It is also fundamentally, categorically untrue to suggest that the jab was never promised or that

<|startofarticle|>  The NHS data said pregnant women make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care as they urge mums-to-be to get vaccinated Pregnant women are being urged to get vaccinated as soon as they are offered the chance, according to figures. NHS data has warned that pregnant women make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care. Officials fear that some badly hit by the pandemic are getting jabbed as a result. Some badly hit are getting offered jabs as a third jabbed woman opens up about the NHS's woes. More than 81,000 pregnant women have received their first jab since the start of lockdown in July - more than 81,000 who will be told by today's DHM. Many are getting jabbed as a result of the success of the vaccine rollout, with some as young as 17. Another 17-year-old has had his second dose snatched away from him. NHS England said about 80% of the jabbed are in London, with over 78,000 passengers a Government-backed scheme. But Mr Johnson has ruled out rejoining the EU or "ripping up" the current deal, instead arguing for "sensible adjustments" to be made to improve what is in place. Labour has demanded that jabs be offered in the "right" way - such as a vaccine passport or a vaccine passport-holders could be eligible for the cut-price deal today. Mr Johnson told Sky News: "We've got to do the right thing, we've got to do the right thing as far as possible of not just reopening the economy but also reopening up new sources of income. "I think we can do that. We can do that." He added: "We can't afford not to." Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned that the deal could be struck "as a trade-off" but that it was "not true" for many people. It is widely believed that the PM and Mr Javid had a rocky first year of the deal. However, Downing Street minister said that Mr Javid "has been very clear" that the final deal would not be "as straightforward as it could have been". There are now fears that the deal could be a long-term sticking plaster to the damage the Government's premiership-busting policies have done to health. The Health Secretary admitted that the "woke public" may continue to harbour "very deep" hopes and expectations about the vaccine. One health minister said: "If it feels very strongly that it's right, and it can be very emotional, and then of course there is the possibility of a little bit of self-isolation, then that's very important." But Mr Javid was not clear how leaving open the option of wearing a face mask would affect the final price. We asked him if a one-off Â£teasor mask would be enough. He said: "Yes, of course we will have an option of wearing a mask, of course we will have warnings about it, we will have measures taken to protect the health system, and that is good. But what we don't know is exactly how we would balance that taking into account the benefits that we know from our vaccine programme, which is a premium vaccine programme, the costs of vaccine are obviously going to be very high. "But I would say that for a range of reasons you can always say you have have have," he said. "As far as wearing a mask helps, I think it's a very good thing, because wearing a mask helps. It reminds people of the benefits of the vaccine, it reminds people of the terrible side effects of the vaccine, and it reminds people of the economic benefits of the vaccine." But Dr Helen Wall, chief medical officer of the British Medical Association, said: "I think it's not clear what the impact of the vaccine programme has been. "I think it's been very, very good for lungs, it's been very, very good for children, it's been very, very good for their lungs. "I think it's been very, very good for the economy. I think it's been very, very good for the economy." The medicines' chief said they had "no doubt" there will be more support for the masks on the NHS as the campaign goes on. Prof Anthony Harnden, chief executive of ASHA, said: "We are confident that the evidence is supporting the idea that wearing a mask helps to protect you, your family and your child." Health spokesman Munira Wilson said: "The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has been closed for 11 days with the test moratorium lifted for those travelling back to England. "This is a significant blow to the efforts of working families and is a setback for businesses. "We need to know urgently what role the NI will play and how it will be aligned with our green manufacturing plans." The

<|startofarticle|>  The Government has made clear it expects schools, in particular primaries, to be the very last thing that closes in the event of further restrictions  Education chiefs have insisted tackling child poverty is the "top priority" of their academies. The Government has made clear it expects schools, in particular primaries, to be the very last thing that closes in the event of further restrictions on parenting online. But Mr Johnson's office has not denied that Covid restrictions will be back in schools. YouGov also revealed that 4.3m tests have not shown that the vaccine is safe for pregnant women. Mr Johnson told Sky News: "We want to make sure that we never take another woman for granted. "We want to make sure that we have the resources available to support her and to make sure that we do have the support available for vaccination to be available." After big data popped up, the Government appeared to be backing up its manifesto commitment by claiming it was "5% to be exact". That number could jump as high as 10% in the coming weeks - but is still "very much higher than we thought". The PM also said the Government would "continue to work with" schools to find ways of increasing uptake among parents. Some Tory MPs are storming ahead with the ban on MPs joining the Government's 'levelling up' effort against global poverty, as No 10 finally publishes the proposals for a New Economics Tax Credit for small businesses. Tories are expected to peer into this as a result of the Dec 8 poll - with the Tories only edge away from fourth place. One Starmer insider commented: "We need to do a lot of cleaning up our act." Government insiders claimed that No 10 was "not going to give us money" without giving the businesses it wants. This could include scrapping the Â£20 UC credit and replacing it with a new scheme that allows staff to be paid if they perform as expected - and sometimes badly. The new UC scheme will be subject to change without a vote, with the final decision expected in the week of March 9. But Mr Johnson is said to be confident that Tory MPs will "not be looking to rip up the plans" and do not intend to in any way undercut the new scheme. One Starmer insider commented: "If there's a blow to the recovery, it's if we can turn the tide of things." They added: "Keir needs them. He's not going anywhere". Mr Johnson has tried to play down the importance of jobs, fortune and centenary celebrations, saying that all of Britain's "enemies are back" in the wake of the election. But he is expected to play down the importance of tomorrow, saying that "days are nigh", as he confirmed he would stage the first lockdown. He has also said that "days are nigh" because of the size of the hole created by the pandemic, "we can't allow them to continue". No 10 said that "the President has confidence in the Prime Minister's ability to declare when there has been no work actually done on the problem and when there has been a hint of activity it's usually from the Prime Minister himself". But Mr Johnson's credibility has been pushed to the brink by the Mirror revelations, with the PM's former communications director Dominic Cummings warning that the PM's former top aide Eddie Lister was planning to take over as the new head of the UK's main financial centre. Mr Johnson faces angry calls to finally explain what happened and why his top aide was sent a Christmas present last year. One said: "He's getting very angry with the Government over the way they've handled the Commissioner's Christmas present. "The Treasury is laughing at us, they're laughing at their little children for laughing at us for years. "We've never done anything so brazenly this serious." Old Three Crowns insiders suggested that Mr Johnson's new gig was simply "worrying" as he had no plans to quit. It comes after 36-year-old Mr Cummings apologised for his comments and said the PM should have told the Commissioner earlier this year that paracetamol was "not the most immediate threat" to the safety of school children. The PM last week sat snoozing with friends in No 10 after a quiz in honour of the murdered policeman was accused of killing Ms Arcuri. He has since apologised, saying "it had all gone away" and he would "forward accordingly" if he had felt "betrayed". But the claims threaten to create a new controversy for the ex-journalist who had helpfully built a reputation on good relations with the British ambassador in Mexico. Mr Johnson said he was "hugely proud" of his vaccine centre's Â£20 million funding package for the first year. The PM had offered to give the money back but it had not come through the Commons division where it had been earmarked for subsequent consideration. There was still hope of getting the Â£20 million a year â€“ and a body added to the pile after the Tories came under sustained pressure

<|startofarticle|>  [Labour] <|startofarticle|> The Government is under pressure to give clarity on how GCSEs and A-Levels will look next summer â€™end of termâ€™ Read more Read moreâ€™end of reportâ€™ The Government has wasted no time and effort putting GCSE, A-level and T-bone exams on the back of plans for a new science and technology estate in Whitehall The last thing the Government wants is to fill five A-level chairships with A-level clowns this summer. They want us to believe they're real people who actually want to do this. That they deserve this. We should be thanking them for their efforts. But instead we're being told we've let them down. We've been left behind due to a lack of scientific expertise or because we've let them down too often. Let's be clear: there are no credentials for the next chancellor of the Exchequer. Neither of those people are going to be coming along for the vaccine passports. There's no point having those conversations if the Government doesn't have them. We need them now. "The only way the Government can ensure that they're not taking the vaccine is by giving them a pass or both of passing pressure is if they pass." Mr Starmer is believed to have told the Health Secretary that he would "hold firm" when asked if he would hold firm if employers failed to vaccinate their staff. The Labour leader said he would "hold firm" even though the number of people allowed to work British tourists fell by 53,000 over the last decade. He said: "You can't expect the Government to be honest with you about those things and then drop them in the same week." But Mr Starmer said the Government "woke up and said we need to vaccinate the Irish who were coming in contact with me, and we didn't want them to have to self-isolate and self-isolate again. "We didn't want to let those people down." He added: "Barely a week goes by without a story about people being ignored or forgotten. "The only time these things happen is if people make a decision and there's a spark in your fire."

<|startofarticle|>  The NHS data said pregnant women make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care as they urge mums-to-be to get vaccinated Pregnant women are being urged to get the coronavirus jab after it was revealed one in five critically ill patients are unvaccinated mothers-to-be. NHS data said they make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care. Officials fear early guidance for expectant mothers to avoid the jab until there was more evidence it was safe has put many off. But the advice changed as getting Covid can be dangerous for pregnant women. Some badly hit have had Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation therapy. It is only used when lungs are so damaged a ventilator cannot maintain oxygen levels. Out of all women between 16 and 49 on the special machine, pregnant women make up 32%, up from 6% at the start of lockdown. England's top midwife will today try to reassure women to get the vaccine. Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent said: "This is another stark reminder the jab can keep you, your baby and your loved ones safe. "You can receive vaccination at any time in pregnancy, but the risks unvaccinated pregnant women face of becoming severely unwell if they catch Covid show exactly why we advise you to do so as soon as possible". Claire Bromley, 33, of Kent, spent nearly a month in a critical care unit after catching Covid while pregnant. Recovering at home, she said: "The risk of not having the Covid vaccine far outweighs any doubts about having it." Public Health England said more than 81,000 pregnant women have received their first dose while 65,000 have had their second shot. Carrie Johnson, who is pregnant with her second child, became fully vaccinated this summer and urges others to do the same. The PM's wife understand people's fears but said the evidence was "reassuring" and there was no increased risk of miscarriage. Vaccination during pregnancy is urged by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Royal College of Midwives. Data from 100,000 jabs among UK mums-to-be and 160,000 in the US show there has been no harm to the foetus or infant. Dr Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: "The disproportionate number of unvaccinated pregnant women in intensive care demonstrates a significant risk of severe illness from Covid-19 in pregnancy." There are concerns the vaccine rollout is faltering with only one in nine secondary school pupils in England inoculated so far. Experts warned the slow pace risks the health of children and their older relatives with Covid deaths still averaging 120 a day. Prof Peter Openshaw said low jab rates among teens would "amplify the outbreak". Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  The Prime Minister was landing in New York on Sunday night, and will sit down for a face-to-face meeting with one of the world's richest men - before he heads to Washington for a summit at the White House ?" asks the Government's controversial 'kill list' warning against new variants of the AUKUS variant which could be able to enter the UK. The Government's controversial 'kill list' warning against new variants of the variant is causing concern among Constitutional lawyers after being signed off by the PM. The maximum penalty for failing to lockdown is a Â£5,000 fine. The maximum penalty for not having the vaccine is a Â£5,000 jail sentence. Mr Johnson's lockdown came in the wake of the Greensill vaccine scare which claimed 30,000 lives. Earlier this month he announced an 'accelerator' list which would be updated daily. On December 16, it emerged that only one day's notice will be given out of the country for those who have tested positive. Labour has demanded that anyone who tests positive must have their package jab jabs delivered by May 15. Mr Johnson told the Commons during his first conference speech that the House of Commons would have to act as a "precision" for further restrictions to protect the country. He said: "The urgency of the vaccine hesitancy group saying they don't want to be vaccinated is very, very strong. "We get angry when we hear that some of those who are trying to get the jab, want it, but they are turned away because they are unvaccinated. "That is unacceptable." Millions of Brits are worried they will not be able to travel to their destinations in the coming days, and that they will need a vaccine to enter the UK. Mr Johnson said: "We will be acting now, in the next days, because we know when we do need to act is the time to act. "I know that a lot of people are very angry with us, but we are not going to change the rules." Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  The Mirror has been told that Boris Johnson has cleared his diary today for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team, while Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned there are 'no guarantees' Christmas gatherings will be able to go ahead Tougher restrictions may be imposed in England next week as Covid infections soar. The Mirror understands Boris Johnson is set to have urgent meetings tomorrow with scientists and his top team. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned there are "no guarantees" Christmas gatherings will be able to go ahead. It comes days after Mr Johnson assured the public the Government will not "cancel" Christmas. Measures on the table include a ban on households mixing and the closure of indoor hospitality venues and non-essential shops within days. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has failed to rule out a circuit breaker lockdown in England before Christmas to cut pressure on the NHS. Fears the Government will "cancel" Christmas come as official figures show there were another 82,866 cases of Covid today, up more than 50% in the past week. Covid cases topped 80,000 for only the fourth time since the start of pandemic with the new Omicron variant up 50% in just 24 hours. The Government's scientific advisers said it was "almost certain" there were hundreds of thousands of new Omicron infections each day. Mr Javid warned there were "no guarantees" that Christmas gatherings would be able to go ahead as planned. The Government's SAGE committee of advisers has cautioned that hospitalisations could surge to between 3,000 and 10,000 a day unless urgent action is taken. The Health Secretary admitted that "everything is under review" after the grim assessment suggested that infections could reach two million by the end of the month. The Mirror has been told Boris Johnson has cleared his diary for tomorrow for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team. No10 said that the PM was in touch with his advisers and keeping abreast of the data, while the four nations of the UK met for a Cobra meeting on the situation. But - with just five days before families are due to gather for Christmas â€“ a source said there was no plans for a press conference tomorrow announcing any changes to restrictions. Mr Javid, 52, admitted that scientific advice warning of a possible a surge in hospital admissions from Omicron was worrying - and that he would be cutting down on hugs with his elderly mum. He suggested the Government could not rule out any new measures before Christmas, adding: "There are no guarantees in this pandemic. "At this point we just have to keep everything under review." Earlier, when asked to rule out tougher rules in the coming days, he said: "We are assessing the situation, it's very fast-moving. "We've seen with Omicron there's a lot that we still don't know about Omicron. That's the truth of the matter. The reality is there's a lot of uncertainty." But he admitted that it was "time to be more cautious" and the Government would do "what is necessary" to keep the public safe. The PM is believed to prefer the prospect of delaying restrictions until after Christmas - even though that could be too late for the NHS. Mr Javid's remarks will cause yet more outrage among Conservative backbenchers after almost 100 voted to block much milder restrictions last week. The PM - who has repeatedly insisted that Christmas will go ahead - is likely to face another huge Tory rebellion to push any changes through. The Government has said MPs would be asked to return to Parliament to vote if new restrictions are needed. One Tory rebel, senior MP Tobias Ellwood, said the Government had to improve its handling of the pandemic. "It's on the bus, off the bus. The economy stops then starts again. We can't continue doing that," he said. The speculation over new restrictions comes after experts warned there are likely already hundreds of thousands of new infections from Omicron every day. If even a small number of them ended up in hospital it could risk overwhelming the NHS. Of the 82,866 cases of Covid today these included 12,133 cases of Omicron, up from 10,059 the day before, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Deaths in England of people with the variant rose to 12, up from seven, while hospital admissions increased to 104, up from 85. Prof Stephen Reicher, a member of SAGE, said it was clear that Plan B measures alone would not stop the spiralling numbers of cases. He cautioned that waiting until after Christmas to act is "probably too late". Fellow SAGE member Professor Sir David Spiegelhalter said: "We can't wait for hospitalisations to go through the roof before we do something about it, because by then it's too late. "In fact what happens by the end of this year is pretty well built-in now. There's almost pretty well nothing we can do about it." Former

<|startofarticle|>  The NHS data said pregnant women make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care as they urge mums-to-be to get vaccinated Pregnant women are being urged to get vaccinated as soon as they are pregnant, as fears of a new Covid surge in the UK soar. NHS data said the number of pregnancy deaths in the UK is expected to be higher than during the peak of the last winter. MD Anderson Silva, who advises the Government on preventative health action, said the data is "clearly wrong" and it is "wrong" to slash the UK's national vaccine rollout. The Brazilian, who has not denied responsibility for the Covid pandemic, told MPs: "We should be thanking children for sticking with us despite the pandemic. "Not only have we not spared any of those who desperately need us, we have left our shores graceingly cold." The vaccine roll-out has been sped up and mass-testing has been introduced in 'hotspots' across the country, he added. Mr Johnson faces angry calls to finally deliver on his promise to fix the social care funding crisis after MPs slammed the Government for delaying the final step out of lockdown. Social care funding is expected to be touched on in the final stages of the bill before it flies to Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle for a vote. But the Prime Minister, a vaccine booster dictator, doesn't seem to care about social care. No 10 says it is for the NHS to decide. Instead of throwing millions of elderly people into poverty, Mr Johnson is in the business of it â€“ himself a supporter of it. He said last night: "We will do whatever we can to ensure we never take for granted our elderly in our time of need. "We will do whatever we can to ensure the care and support we deserve is afforded us and our families the best care and support." Mr Johnson is expected to confirm that peers have voted to keep the uplift permanently - and that it will be replaced by a new fund to help vulnerable people get back to the office more quickly. Under the original plan, the Government would have asked people to "exercise judgement" over whether their benefits were worth the cost of the extension. But after a backlash from Tory backbenchers, the Government has turned their attention elsewhere. Mr Johnson said last night: "The decision to leave the EU has regrettably led to a further surge in cases of infection. We have therefore decided to ask people to take responsibility and begin preparing for the worst." Millions of people across the country have already begun returning to their offices to get tested - and many are already feeling much better about their quarantine plans. The Government has promised that the final step out of lockdown in England will be reached later this week. When asked for his next move, Mr Johnson said: "We will make sure that the regulations are there to protect us and our businesses." But Mr Johnson faces fury from Tory backbenchers after he refused to say whether the Government would prioritise the beefed-up Test and Trace system last winter. Asked if he would prioritise the overhaul in future, the Prime Minister said: "We will do whatever we can to support our members in whatever we can do to support them in doing so." But the fall-out from the Mirror's revelations over the winter months could plunge Britain into a new type of economic and security crisis. Mr Johnson is reported to have privately confided his growing frustration with the Government's failure to address the social care crisis during the pandemic. He told his MPs: "We are facing a new type of crisis. It is difficult to be optimistic and to remain optimistic is something that we have got to deal with." He added: "We cannot be complacent about the fact that we can't have all of this without bringing about the appropriate change in the system." Mr Johnson's stubborn insistence that there is a "certainly a certain level of competence" required to get the Government through winter is yet another sign that he is unable to see the future for his battered health.  The PM is set to face another huge test on New Year's Day as he tries to regain the narrative from Covid about how his time in hospital was worth it. Boris Johnson was due to appear before the Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee on January 27 but he has still not replied to the Independent Office for Police Conduct asking for their permission.  Former Covid chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said it was vital for the PM to "get back to being what he is" and admitted that it was "really important" to put the "requirement" back in the statute books. Prof Whitty said: "If is not followed through on that, then we risk the health of patients and the health of the wider health system being damaged." Health Secretary Sajid Javid refused to rule out another lockdown in January, saying he had a "lot of other options" including from his discretion. But he said

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want a return to the bubble system in England - but accepted compulsory face coverings in class could make a comeback Secondary school pupils could be told to wear face-masks in school once again to keep Covid at bay this winter, the Education Secretary has admitted. Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want to see the return of bubbles where whole classes or year groups were sent home after a positive test. But he admitted that compulsory face-masks in lessons could make a come-back if cases spike. "I've got a contingency plan, as you would expect me to do. It contains lots of contingencies, including masks, absolutely," he told Sky News. The mandatory wearing of face coverings in schools and colleges was scrapped in May, but Government guidance says that directors of public health could advise schools to reintroduce them if cases spike. It comes after Government figures showed the number of children out of school for Covid-19 related reasons in England increased by two thirds in a fortnight. The DfE estimates that 2.5% of all pupils - more than 204,000 children - were not in class for reasons connected to coronavirus on Thursday last week. This is up from 122,300 children, or 1.5% of all pupils, on September 16 - a 67% rise from two weeks ago. Mr Zahawi also defended the slow rollout of carbon dioxide monitors which were first promised by the Department for Education in August. In Wales, secondary school and college pupils will be advised to take daily lateral flow tests for seven days if someone in their household tests positive for coronavirus, the Welsh Government has announced. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Zahawi said he was concerned about the impact Covid-19 measures had on attendance. He said: "The good news is that - and thanks to the brilliant teachers and support staff and parents and children - 99% of schools are open. "Attendance has gone up, the last set of figures I looked at was about 90%, which obviously will fluctuate depending on infection rates. "But my priority is to protect education, keep those schools open." But he said he was not looking to return to the bubble system to do so, "because actually, you saw the fall off in attendance which really does harm mental wellbeing, mental health of children". That is despite Englnad's schools previously being told backup plans must "cover the possibility that in some local areas it may become necessary to reintroduce 'bubbles' for a temporary period, to reduce mixing between groups. "Any decision to recommend the reintroduction of 'bubbles' would not be taken lightly and would need to take account of the detrimental impact they can have on the delivery of education."

<|startofarticle|>  The NHS data said pregnant women make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care as they urge mums-to-be to get vaccinated Pregnant women are being urged to get vaccinated as soon as they are pregnant, as fears of a new Covid surge in the UK soar. NHS data said the pregnant women make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care. Officials fear the new variant could be particularly dangerous in crowded, indoor settings where women are more at risk of passing the virus. Some hospitals have decided to keep the jab for patients with pregnant women, even if the rate for men has plummeted. But ministers warned it was "not necessarily a bad thing" and that it made women less likely to get the jab. Prof Louise Hayward of the University of Glasgow, chair of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: "We shouldn't have babies anyway. "We women are pregnant and we are pregnant women and we are pregnant women and we are pregnant women and we are pregnant women and we are pregnant women and we are pregnant women and we are pregnant women and we are pregnant women and we are pregnant women and we are pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women and we're pregnant women.

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want a return to the bubble system in England - but accepted compulsory face coverings in class could make a comeback Secondary school pupils could be told to wear face-masks in school once again to keep Covid at bay this winter, the Education Secretary has admitted. Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want to see the return of bubbles where whole classes or year groups were sent home after a positive test. But he admitted that compulsory face-masks in lessons could make a come-back if cases spike. "I've got a contingency plan, as you would expect me to do. It contains lots of contingencies, including masks, absolutely," he told Sky News. The mandatory wearing of face coverings in schools and colleges was scrapped in May, but Government guidance says that directors of public health could advise schools to reintroduce them if cases spike. It comes after Government figures showed the number of children out of school for Covid-19 related reasons in England increased by two thirds in a fortnight. The DfE estimates that 2.5% of all pupils - more than 204,000 children - were not in class for reasons connected to coronavirus on Thursday last week. This is up from 122,300 children, or 1.5% of all pupils, on September 16 - a 67% rise from two weeks ago. Mr Zahawi also defended the slow rollout of carbon dioxide monitors which were first promised by the Department for Education in August. In Wales, secondary school and college pupils will be advised to take daily lateral flow tests for seven days if someone in their household tests positive for coronavirus, the Welsh Government has announced. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Zahawi said he was concerned about the impact Covid-19 measures had on attendance. He said: "The good news is that - and thanks to the brilliant teachers and support staff and parents and children - 99% of schools are open. "Attendance has gone up, the last set of figures I looked at was about 90%, which obviously will fluctuate depending on infection rates. "But my priority is to protect education, keep those schools open." But he said he was not looking to return to the bubble system to do so, "because actually, you saw the fall off in attendance which really does harm mental wellbeing, mental health of children". That is despite Englnad's schools previously being told backup plans must "cover the possibility that in some local areas it may become necessary to reintroduce 'bubbles' for a temporary period, to reduce mixing between groups. "Any decision to recommend the reintroduction of 'bubbles' would not be taken lightly and would need to take account of the detrimental impact they can have on the delivery of education."

<|startofarticle|>  The Mirror has been told that Boris Johnson has cleared his diary today for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team, while Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned there are 'no guarantees' Christmas gatherings will be able to go ahead Tougher restrictions may be imposed in England next week as Covid infections soar. The Mirror understands Boris Johnson is set to have urgent meetings tomorrow with scientists and his top team. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned there are "no guarantees" Christmas gatherings will be able to go ahead. It comes days after Mr Johnson assured the public the Government will not "cancel" Christmas. Measures on the table include a ban on households mixing and the closure of indoor hospitality venues and non-essential shops within days. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has failed to rule out a circuit breaker lockdown in England before Christmas to cut pressure on the NHS. Fears the Government will "cancel" Christmas come as official figures show there were another 82,866 cases of Covid today, up more than 50% in the past week. Covid cases topped 80,000 for only the fourth time since the start of pandemic with the new Omicron variant up 50% in just 24 hours. The Government's scientific advisers said it was "almost certain" there were hundreds of thousands of new Omicron infections each day. Mr Javid warned there were "no guarantees" that Christmas gatherings would be able to go ahead as planned. The Government's SAGE committee of advisers has cautioned that hospitalisations could surge to between 3,000 and 10,000 a day unless urgent action is taken. The Health Secretary admitted that "everything is under review" after the grim assessment suggested that infections could reach two million by the end of the month. The Mirror has been told Boris Johnson has cleared his diary for tomorrow for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team. No10 said that the PM was in touch with his advisers and keeping abreast of the data, while the four nations of the UK met for a Cobra meeting on the situation. But - with just five days before families are due to gather for Christmas â€“ a source said there was no plans for a press conference tomorrow announcing any changes to restrictions. Mr Javid, 52, admitted that scientific advice warning of a possible a surge in hospital admissions from Omicron was worrying - and that he would be cutting down on hugs with his elderly mum. He suggested the Government could not rule out any new measures before Christmas, adding: "There are no guarantees in this pandemic. "At this point we just have to keep everything under review." Earlier, when asked to rule out tougher rules in the coming days, he said: "We are assessing the situation, it's very fast-moving. "We've seen with Omicron there's a lot that we still don't know about Omicron. That's the truth of the matter. The reality is there's a lot of uncertainty." But he admitted that it was "time to be more cautious" and the Government would do "what is necessary" to keep the public safe. The PM is believed to prefer the prospect of delaying restrictions until after Christmas - even though that could be too late for the NHS. Mr Javid's remarks will cause yet more outrage among Conservative backbenchers after almost 100 voted to block much milder restrictions last week. The PM - who has repeatedly insisted that Christmas will go ahead - is likely to face another huge Tory rebellion to push any changes through. The Government has said MPs would be asked to return to Parliament to vote if new restrictions are needed. One Tory rebel, senior MP Tobias Ellwood, said the Government had to improve its handling of the pandemic. "It's on the bus, off the bus. The economy stops then starts again. We can't continue doing that," he said. The speculation over new restrictions comes after experts warned there are likely already hundreds of thousands of new infections from Omicron every day. If even a small number of them ended up in hospital it could risk overwhelming the NHS. Of the 82,866 cases of Covid today these included 12,133 cases of Omicron, up from 10,059 the day before, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Deaths in England of people with the variant rose to 12, up from seven, while hospital admissions increased to 104, up from 85. Prof Stephen Reicher, a member of SAGE, said it was clear that Plan B measures alone would not stop the spiralling numbers of cases. He cautioned that waiting until after Christmas to act is "probably too late". Fellow SAGE member Professor Sir David Spiegelhalter said: "We can't wait for hospitalisations to go through the roof before we do something about it, because by then it's too late. "In fact what happens by the end of this year is pretty well built-in now. There's almost pretty well nothing we can do about it." Former

<|startofarticle|>  The Opposition is urging business leaders and MPs to help tackle the cost of living crisis this winter - so they can be paid to keep it  [Products must be sold at a reasonable price and minimise the risk of supply issues]  The Government has promised that homeowners will be able to sell their homes again this winter - but only if they hit the annual cost-of-living target. Businesses have been warned that the real terms price increase this winter could take the total cost of living crisis into the millions. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has insisted that the Government will "not be shy" about demanding that businesses meet the Â£3.5 billion (4.1%) annual target. Government sources suggested that Mr Kwarteng's willingness to compromise with ministers to finally get his Brexit deal over the line was the "price" of a trade deal. The UK had been seeking to cross the Â£3 billion (4.1%) annual EU climate target in Antarctica by the end of June - and avoid a new wave of havoc by January. But Mr Kwarteng's authority has been pushed to the brink by the unfolding disaster in Yemen, where civilians have been killed and their assets looted. Tory MPs have threatened to vote against the Building Safety Bill, which the Government says it needs to keep the peace process going. Industry chiefs have been warned that MPs could vote against it unless they have voted previously to force a trade deal with the US. Industry chiefs have been urging ministers to keep the Â£15bn (MD 5.1 billion) annual cap on building affordable homes, which the Government says it needs. The Government has also been urged by unions to keep the pay-rise for public sector workers unchanged. Talks continue over the exact wording of the PM's demand, but the Government is expected to confirm it at Prime Minister's Questions. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: "The Government's commitment to delivering real change in our country means putting off for years the payment of rent, and paying our bills not just in full, but in full every month. "This Government is too slow, and we're willing to help them in the form of more funding, but we are not prepared to stand in their way. "We are calling on the Government to stop short of a spending pledge on a wall of austerity." Read More Read More

The former Goldman Sachs banker revealed that he was not vaccinating their children because he was not worried about the risk of Covid. But his words rang hollow on the front line of vaccine hesitancy in vulnerable people. Boris Johnson faces an internal rebellion from Tory backbenchers over his decision to delay the UK's second dose of the jab. School leaders and teaching unions have warned that heads have been left without enough staff to administer the vaccine in overcrowded schools. The Government has promised that the end of the first stage of the third wave of exams in England will give pupils the time to get used to the vaccine. But he has not said how the vaccine will be distributed among schools, with advisers claiming it will have to be split between colleges and university clusters. Mr Zahawi's letter is calling on the PM to make the decision among schools, colleges and training institutes. It also wants to make sure the vaccine is not taken away on days of assembly and in class after all outbreaks have been recorded. Labour has suggested that if the Government does not get a grip on the situation within days, the result will be a "fork in the road" for the peace process. Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  The Mirror has learned the former attorney general missed voting while in Mauritius this week despite facing growing criticism for being abroad while Parliament is sitting Under-fire Sir Geoffrey Cox this week missed yet more Commons votes from abroad - this time from Mauritius more than 6,000 miles from Britain. Sources in the island nation told the Mirror the former attorney general was on a "short business trip" there and "met with quite a few people" for meetings. The former attorney general is a partner in an international law firm, Thomas More International Ltd, based in the country, which is in the Indian Ocean. Sir Geoffrey is believed to have left Mauritius, with which he has long-standing links, on Tuesday night meaning he missed at least two days when Parliament was in session. While he was away, MPs voted four times on two separate bills - telecommunications and sewage - but he was paired with an Opposition MP for them all meaning he had permission to be absent. Sir Geoffrey, who has not broken any Commons rules by voting from Mauritius and is likely to have had the blessing of the Tory chief whip, has been approached for comment. It comes after Sir Geoffrey faced criticism for working as a legal advisor in the British Virgin Islands for several weeks earlier this year while the Commons was sitting. While his trip to the Caribbean did not break any rules, he has been reported to the standards commissioner after footage emerged of him taking part in later hearings from his Commons office. MPs are banned from using their Parliamentary offices or resources for outside work. Shadow Commons leader Thangam Debbonaire blasted: "What on earth must Geoffrey Cox's constituents think? "He is meant to be representing them but instead habitually misses days and days of parliamentary time putting his business interests first. "The Prime Minister must make Geoffrey Cox choose between putting his constituents first or his own interests." The top-flight QC has been at the centre of a new sleaze storm after earning more than Â£1m from legal work in the last year. He clocked in 22 hours a week on average - on top of his Â£81k job as a Tory MP. Mr Johnson has refused to condemn Sir Geoffrey, arguing that it would be "inappropriate" for him to comment on his case. He even argued MPs having second jobs "has actually strengthened our democracy" by bringing outside experience to Westminster.  But he added: "If that system is going to continue today, then it is crucial that MPs follow the rules" including putting the job of an MP first. Sir Geoffrey visited the British Virgin Islands in April and May this year - 4,000 miles away from his Devon seat - and cast Commons votes remotely from there while doing legal work. He had the permission of chief whip Mark Spencer, already under fire over the Owen Paterson scandal, to vote by proxy while Parliament was sitting. While his trip to the Caribbean did not break any Commons rules, footage has now emerged of Sir Geoffrey taking part in later hearings on September 14. MPs are banned from using their Parliamentary offices or resources for outside work but the video appears to show Sir Geoffrey in an office in Parliament. At one point he gets up, only to tell the hearing later: "Forgive my absence during some of the morning - I'm afraid the bell went off."  This is thought to refer to the division bell, which rings loudly across Westminster to alert MPs and peers that they are needed to vote. Records suggest Sir Geoffrey appeared in a corruption inquiry on behalf of the British Virgin Islands government on eleven separate days the Commons sat this year. There were three in May, two in June, two in September and four in October.  Some were in person on a trip to the Caribbean tax haven - while most were virtual after his return to the UK.  By comparison, he has spoken just once in the Commons chamber in the last 18 months. The top Tory had been reported to the standards watchdog by Labour's Angela Rayner who said the alleged use of the office appeared to be "an egregious, brazen breach of the rules". She has written to standards commissioner Kathryn Stone asking her for "guidance on beginning a formal investigation on this matter". But Sir Geoffrey put out a bullish statement saying he "does not believe he breached the rules" - and that he would cooperate with the investigation. Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  The SNP's Pete Wishart told the joint session of the House of Commons and the Lords that he did not believe there was a "high likelihood" of a Labour-Nix majority in the 95-seat House of Lords - and that he would vote against any new restrictions  If Boris Johnson were to lose his position as Prime Minister, it would be a "shameful moment" for the British government  for its historic decision to break with precedent and allow Tory MPs to run for Commons seats. The SNP has been accused of playing down the chances of a Labour-Nix majority in the House of Lords, with one report even suggesting it could be needed as early as this week. It comes as Labour publishes new information about how it's possible for the party to lose seats across the country. It shows that Labour has lost almost all of our former parliamentary seats to the Tories since the Tories came to power in 2010. And it shows how the Tories have failed to deliver on their election pledge to end British cronyism, by putting Labour on the front foot again. "It's a sad day when you get a by-election result that is in breach of expectations. "We've seen that with asbestos, with Northern Ireland, with the energy crisis and with Brexit. "We can't allow the good work that has been done by the NHS and schools and hospitals to be undone by this." Mr Wishart told the joint session of the House of Commons and Lords the NHS was a "crucial part" of the Government's economic plan. And he claimed that the corporation tax, which is already low, was "the wrong policy" and that it had made a mockery of things like social care. He claimed that the "top down" approach to taxation had made the NHS "unionsourced" and that it had made the social care system "unionsourced". He stood in favour of taxing commercial property, saying the idea that the taxpayer should pay for things like roads and rail links was "not the right way to do it". He also backed plans for MPPs to be classified as "high priority" like the one Health Secretary Matt Hancock proposed. It is thought that Health Secretary Sajid Javid has rejected the idea of having the classification change take place, saying it would be "difficult and expensive" given the pandemic. There is still hope, he said, that the classification change will be permanent, saying it "has been shown repeatedly... that it will make it harder for us to do our job." He added: "It's not about personnel, it's not because it's Boris Johnson, it's about our democracy. "Nobody is above the law, the rules are there for a reason." Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  The SNP's Pete Wishart told the joint session of the Parliamentary Secretaries' debate on Wednesday that it was 'cash for honours 2.0' as he admitted that Labour had failed to show that it was serious about equality  People are now willing to support unions more than ever before with the Â£20 UC cut, a Â£10-a-week uplift and the closure of schools Labour has been accused of failing to earn that people like Labour star MP Pete Wishart are worth more than their salaries. Labour has been accused of failing to earn that people like Labour star MP Pete Wishart are worth more than their salaries. The party was accused of "missing a huge opportunity" after Boris Johnson became Prime Minister and promised that a new workers' rights bill would be published in due course. But the Labour leader admitted that it was "not true" for certain MPs to be entitled to their "award-winning pay" for campaigning for the Labour Party in 2019. Mr Wishart told the joint session of the House of Commons: "The fact is that over the last year we have seen the pandemic take its toll on people's lives, livelihoods and freedoms. "On top of that, we have seen this technology and infrastructure take its toll. "So, I would also like to say to all of you, as a Government that has spent a huge amount of time and effort, that we have no plans at all to make this a country where people can get their clothes back as soon as they can." Mr Wishart told the debate: "In order to do that, we need a levelling up agenda, a planning system that allows for the use of new land for parkland, and we need to have a proper planning system." The Labour leader was asked about Tory lobbyists bundling up to Â£1m in Government contracts to help deliver the vaccine. He refused to answer the question, instead saying that it was up to the "contractors" who were financing the contracts. The Labour leader had also asked the Treasury to investigate whether the No 10 advertising budget breached the rules. Labour has accused the Tories of hypocrisy after the Government has delivered on its manifesto pledge to end council tax rises by July 19. But Mr Wishart said the situation was "easier" for councils because of the way the law is set out. He said: "If you've not been involved in the matter, I would hope that you don't need to be a council tax lawyer because the law is there to uphold the rules." Mr Wishart said that tax breaks for the wealthy were "not the problem" but that they should be reformed. He said: "The solution to the tax breaks for the wealthy is not tax breaks for the wealthy, it is a matter of time and effort and cooperation between the two groups. "So, at the moment we have about three quarters of Britain's wealth coming from the top one percent, which is overwhelmingly elected officials. "That's because they have presided over the greatest economic and political inequality in decades." He added: "At the moment we do have a very powerful economic and political system, and we are committed to developing new ways of thinking about the whole of the economy and the type of government we want."
