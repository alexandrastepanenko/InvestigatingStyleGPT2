<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer Nicola Sturgeon must learn to live with the virus for another term, claims a damaging new poll shows. Pollsters Opinium say Scots have turned on the Government in the last 12 months because it wasn't tough enough to stop the virus. The Centre For Scottish Politics/Researchers have found "deep" mistrust of the Government is holding people back - and threatening their lives. People are also worried that the warnings about the Government are being ignored. The survey by the Centre for Scottish Politics also found 35 per cent of those polled said they would be less likely to return to school if the Government ignored their warnings.

<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer Joe Biden has hit out at his former senior adviser Dominic Cummings for suggesting "ethnic mixing" is a big problem in Britain. Mr Biden's comments sparked anger from Mr Cummings who is said to be particularly critical of the new White House and the new Secretary of State. In an interview with the Guardian newspaper Mr Biden also took aim at his former chief of staff Dominic Cummings, saying he was "very hostile" to the new White House boss. The spat came as Mr Johnson claimed that Mr Cummings' use of a personal phone number to call people was "coordinated and carried out by a friend or official of his" and suggested he was the target of a hit piece by the left-wing National Review. The row came as Mr Johnson said he had "never" signed up to a register of political donors and that he has yet to receive it. That would be a major breach of the code of conduct for ministers. It comes after aides to the PM said Mr Cummings' use of a personal phone number was "coordinated and carried out by a friend or official of his". Yesterday the Electoral Commission rapped its local election controller for failing to report a social media activity. Cllr James Jamieson, acting boss of the council, said: "This is a council where I'm sure that you would expect to be … a council, you would expect to … you would expect to see this behaviour on the internet. "It's an offence against the rules. "It's an offence to be seen doing so." The watchdog, which has previously levied severe fines for social media posts, yesterday said: "It is clear that the Prime Minister and his aides have a detailed picture of what's going on that they don't want anyone else to see." It added: "It is a clear breach of the rules. There's no legitimate question for the Government to raise in its report what this technology initiative is doing to help people improve their lives." A Cabinet Minister said: "I'm not standing here denying the evidence of social media will do us in." "But nor will anyone else. There's a proper duty to investigate." The Electoral Commission said it was receiving complaints from people who felt their information was being breached. It said it was investigating the "pervasive practice" of social media users "responding in kind to complaints" to Twitter. The party requested details from Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. A spokesman said: "We are looking into what they are doing and why they are doing so, and have received no response." The Electoral Commission said it was "looking into the allegations" but did not recognise "an action as serious as the one taken by Twitter".

<|startofarticle|> ICAL swerved help to avoid a shutdown over the NHS after claims a call with the Prime Minister was "inconceivable". A livid Mr Johnson hit back: "Have you ever seen a call where the Prime Minister, in a call with a Prime Minister of the UK Government,…suggested that I might have to change my mind? "You are put on notice that I have every confidence in the competence of the Home Secretary and the Prime Minister." He added: "You are put on notice that I also have every confidence in the Chancellor of the Exchequer." The row came as Mr Johnson yesterday claimed No10 did not warn him of a No10 lockdown and therefore did not trigger a code of conduct. However, leaked texts sent by one Mr Johnson to a colleague sparked alarm amongst No10 chiefs who thought the Prime Minister was "reading Duke Lackey's book club report". Mr Johnson also said No10 was not under any lockdown and that no decisions had been made. However, the PM hit back: "I think the chief of the police can tell you what I think of as a code of conduct, 'let's not do anything that could raise suspicions'. "I think the way that the government of England approach to this situation is, first of all, closed societies don't come into being." He said added: "The Prime Minister and the Home Secretary, adhere to all the rules, and IwellMentions."
====================
<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer Boris Johnson has been warned he is drinking in the last-chance saloon after his party's huge by-election defeat. The Conservatives lost the once ultra-safe seat of North Shropshire for the first time in 200 years in the wake of sleaze scandals and Christmas party rows. Jubilant Liberal Democrats wiped out the 23,000 majority to seize the seat with their own 6,000 margin after it was vacated by the disgraced ex-Cabinet Minister Owen Paterson. Lib Dem candidate Helen Morgan took the seat with 17,957 votes, pushing Tory Neil Shastri-Hurst into second place on 12,032 — with a 34 per cent swing against him. That is the fourth largest swing in a by-election in the past 30 years. The Tories' thumping was the seventh biggest upset in a by-election since World War Two. But the Prime Minister took "full responsibility" for the defeat and vowed to kick-start his faltering Downing Street operation after weeks of torrid headlines and scandals. He acknowledged he needed to fix the anger over No10 parties and the controversy of his Downing Street refurbishment. But he insisted a "constant litany of stuff about politics and politicians" had overshadowed the Government's successes, such as the rapid roll-out of the Covid booster jab campaign. He told reporters: "I've got to put my hands up and say, 'Have I failed to get that message across in the last few weeks? Has it been obscured by all this other stuff?' Yes, I'm afraid it has." But last night Mr Johnson's Tory enemies spoke out to declare he was one strike away from being ousted. Devout Remainer Sir Roger Gale said: "I think this has to be seen as a referendum on the Prime Minister's performance — and I think that the Prime Minister is now in last orders time." The Kent MP added: "One more strike and he's out." Sir Charles Walker, vice-chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, said a leadership contest would be completely self-indulgent — but added Mr Johnson had a year at most to make a difference. He told Times Radio: "The Prime Minister has got weeks, months, a year to sort himself out. If we go on making unforced errors over the next three to six months or nine months, it will become a lot more serious. It's serious now, but it's not at a critical level yet." Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the treasurer of the 1922 Committee, said it was not the time for a "big blame game" but that Mr Johnson needed to stop the "self-inflicted own goals". However, it was not just the old guard who were calling for Mr Johnson to get a grip. North West Durham MP Richard Holden — who sensationally won the mining community for the Tories in 2019 — warned support for Mr Johnson was not unconditional. Boris faces a tough few months, with the soaring cost of living, threat of future Covid restrictions and biting tax rises next April. The PM's allies are braced for a leadership crisis after potentially painful local elections in May. The Tories hit a historic high in council seats last fought in 2019 under then PM Theresa May. But they risk of losing thousands of council seats next spring at a time described as the "moment of maximum danger" for the PM. This has to be seen as a referendum on the Prime Minister's performance — and I think that the Prime Minister is now in last orders time. Last night, ex-Scottish Tory leader Baroness Ruth Davidson — a long standing critic of the PM — said he was drinking in the last chance saloon and had been "put on warning by his MPs". She said the party was looking for him to sharpen the operation at No10. And she warned it was time "for a bit of bloody grip to be exerted" if he wanted to stay in Downing Street.

<|startofarticle|>  Labour has been accused of "sitting on a egg" after claims a junior minister was blackmailed out. The Labour leader and former minister took to the airwaves to demand "someone" take down James Bond from the airwaves. As the latest scandal demonstrates, there is only one way to win elections. The more people know about this and the less likely it is that someone will be caught.

<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer Alex Hendry has been forced into a new prison because he was not truthful in his defence, a new report reveals. The Sentencing and Parole Board ruled last week that Mr Hendry's sentence was unfair. After deliberation Justice Robert Buckland wrote: "The sentence imposed is in breach of the statutory standards by which the courts should operate." He said: "You provided information which was 'factually untrue', 'substantially false', 'it was an act of criminal misconduct', 'it was not prone to falsification' and 'it was rendered in error'. "It is clear from the appellants' responses that the sentence is not proportionate and, in particular, it is not proportionate in respect of the essential elements of the offence." Priti Patel, our Home Secretary, requested his extradition and the US Government refused. The CBRB report, dated March 2018, states that the US Government "did not knowingly deny or fail to inform the Commission that it was investigating an offence." It adds: "The Commission found no support for its conclusions from the Commission's report."

<|startofarticle|>  Labour has been accused of "sacrificing" its leader - Natalie Bennett - after she called the BBC "overrated, under-educated and racist". The UK's two most left-wing leaders, aged 22 and 12, had been warmly received by the party's new senior figures. But they were told the new members would be given a shot at the first Cabinet ministers post-Brexit. The row was confirmed by a member of the party's security team who was present at the first call with the new members on Wednesday. The man said: "There were a number of people at the conference, some of them even working together, and I think a lot of people were expecting a bit of flak, but at the moment, the response is pretty much the same as everybody says." He added: "I think people are starting to understand the importance of thinking big and being accountable. "This is all about thinking big in theory, but in the end, what you have is you put together a lot of boxes that go 'this is what I want this to look like and therefore I should take this as a whole, my wholeheartedly, but nevertheless, I must say in part because I think it's important in principle to do what's in the best interest of the country and the Union and therefore I am taking this as a whole, my wholeheartedly, as I understand it, as a whole, an independent programme." Despite criticising the new members as "non-engaged" they did not rule out a return to some form of cooperation, saying: "As a small but growing party, we hold you to a high standard. "But, obviously, the question is, once again, whether or not to allow people to come into the party." The plans will be outlined to MPs tomorrow lunchtime.

<|startofarticle|> ICAL swagger is the new normal for a Carrie Johnson film career, The Sun can reveal. The Oscar-winning actress, who has done a double take at BAFTA-winning actress Lucy - who has done a number of nods in the top job - and spoke last night to fear that big studio contracts and a bad show on the studio signside support. She told the BBC it was "a real worry" and she was "increasingly frustrated" that the studio system "makes it hard for people to make original, important, important contributions". And she warned: "It's very difficult, in my opinion, to make important, important contributions in the world without having some sort of sort of sort of echo chamber in which other people's work is scrutinised. "And so it's very, very important that we keep pushing this important argument, which is that people of colour have a right to be heard."
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour has been accused of "sitting on a egg" after claims Cabinet Secretary Simon Case admitted to having "interfered" in the outcome of the vote. The Tories and Lib Dems are furious they voted against legislation that will help the NHS do more for the summer. Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said last night: "It is clear that the Government did not consider the evidence to be conclusive, and therefore it has decided to continue with the policy of allowing the NHS to be done for the summer." He insisted he "noted the guidance that the evidence was inconvenient for allowing the NHS to be done until August, and the subsequent decision to continue." He added: "It is clear that the evidence is inconvenient for allowing the NHS to be done until August. "So it's not surprising that the Home Secretary will justify the decision to continue to do this, even though it is now clear that the data is not going to support that decision. "She has made it very clear she wants to continue to do so. "And now that the data is clearer, it's now more likely she will comply." Embarrassingly, Mr Case did not deny reports that she told confidants she was cutting ties in September.

<|startofarticle|>  Labour has been accused of "sitting on a throne" and "beating on a stick" after sweeping the constituency in a shock election upset. The Conservatives swept to an outright majority in the traditionally red and blue seat of Stoke-on-Trent, which came a year after the Tories' shock election upset. The Tories' thumping was the seventh biggest upset in a by-election since World War Two. But the party showed no sign of letting up - with the result held by a landslide despite the Conservatives huge lead in the vote. The Conservatives have a slim 5,000 majority in the Commons where they have been on a losing track since the departure of big-spending Speaker Norman Lamont. The backbencher has been accused by MPs, ministers and Ms Symonds of breaking cover to demand a leadership election. Allegations came to light last night after Downing Street confirmed a reshuffle. No10 had expected Mr Cummings to head up the group that campaigned against the Government. Instead, he was instead appointed defence secretary and head of the international affairs arm of the UK Security Council. He is also the chairman of the Foreign and Business Offices of the Cabinet Office. Mr Cummings' group of former high-ups including then-PM Theresa May and then-PM Theresa May were backed by 58 Tory MPs. Some even credit him with persuading the PM to return to the table after his third major election victory in six years. But Mr Johnson's and Sir Keir's team's claim was "baffled" by the number of Tories in the Maidenhead and Redbridge by----election and that more than doubled to 70 last night. Last. Saturday. — Mr Johnson won by double digits in a by-election in the Old Town — but he was slammed by MPs as a soft-left wrecking ball who broke new ground by wrecking the already struggling Conservative Party.

<|startofarticle|>  Labour has been accused of "sitting on a throne" and "beating on a stick" and of "sticking up to our king". The party's new national leader, 19, had been camping in the Black Country with his friends when he got the idea for the lockdown. But after being accused of liking "sticks and stones" with other people, the PM's hand was turned. He said: "I don't like to sit on a throne. This is a ballroom party."
====================
<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer Boris Johnson has been warned he is drinking in the last-chance saloon after his party's huge by-election defeat. The Prime Minister,  who has only been in the job for a year after his party's huge by-election defeat at the hands of the Social Democrats, is under huge pressure not to take sides after the by-election. Last night  Labour's Steve Reed hit out: "The PM is now under huge pressure not to take sides after the by-election defeat. "He is now in huge pressure not to take sides after the by-election defeat because of the huge amount of money the Tories have raised so far. "No wonder the PM is so upbraided by the left and right." The Conservatives hit back: "It is clear that all those in the party were misled and now those who were wrong should have been punished."
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour wants to level up
"We have heard the concerns of veterans, and we want to make sure that we bring forward the best candidate for the job, so that the veterans get the support they need, and that the Government supports the qualifications that they have been offered." The unions welcomed the move but warned it would be "totally unfair" given that many have no qualifications and pose no threat to themselves and others. MISERABLE comments made by Mr Gove have been used by ministers to fine ministers more than £200,000. The former Education Secretary told a Tory conference: "I strongly believe that if we go further on this we will end up with a society in which social distancing is outlawed and all people, regardless of their background, colour, or national origin, are excluded." Mr Gove added: "We have got the goods. We have to get them to the people." But the National Cyber Security Centre said the remarks were "absurd and deeply insulting" and suggested racist and sexist firms could be targeted. They added: "The attacks on us come from the left, the rich, and the well-meaning."
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour has been accused of "sitting on a throne" and "beating on a stick" after sweeping the constituency in a shocking upset. The Labour leader and runaway favourite to beat Liz Truss in the Tories' heartlands was second on the Conservative Party leader ticket with 11,000 pledged members. Leadership contender Esther McVey is the youngest ever leader of a major party, and has called for a female commission to be appointed to look into allegations levelled against her. But Mr Johnson's own team appeared to snuff out the racism when asked if they were open to a female co-chairman. One wrote: "We'd love to have you as a co-chairman, but we don't want any old-fashioned racism in our organisation." Another said: "As a former leader, you have a duty to uphold the government and the laws necessary to do that." And a third wrote: "As a former leader, you have a duty to represent the people, and the country, and you should fight for the rights of the British people to be able to peacefully and democratically change government." Other Conservative Party members also sided with the Labour leader in their criticism of the Commission. Former MP Andrew Mitchell said: "It's better than bullying us I suppose." But Sir Keir said he was "sorry" for the backlash and said he was "sorry for the country" if he messaged the group on a personal level. He said: "I'm sorry we got into this in a bad way and I'm sorry we have to apologise for it. "I don't want anyone to feel bad about using social media, and I don't want anyone to feel bad about using social media, but we have to talk to Facebook and see what they can do. "I think that if we can do together."
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour has been accused of "sitting on a throne" and "beating on a stick" after breaking the Cabinet rules. The UK's most senior lawyer has warned there is a "tough autumn ahead" for the country, with growing fears about Covid cases. He points different ways depending on which day it is, changing position more often than the Kama Sutra. The Labour chief's U-turn came after he said Cabinet members should be able to intervene on behalf of the Government if they see evidence of an unfair or abusive practice. He also said ministers have a duty to "provide a briefing" on developments in the Covid-19 pandemic before any Cabinet agreement is struck. That could lead to restrictions on individual MPs entering into agreements with other Members of Parliament, reports The Sun. The U-turn came after it was claimed a senior minister had expressed concerns about the loss of female doctors in the UK. Mr Gove's spokesman said: "We are looking into what is happening to female doctors in the UK and have not found a single case where there was not a female involved." Mr Gove's spokesman said: "We are looking into what is happening to female doctors in the UK and have not found a single case where there was not a female involved." The Health Secretary said there were "no plans" for any more measures, but added "female doctors continue to be the province of male colleagues."

<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer George Osborne has been forced to admit the "reality of the pandemic" - or he will have to shut his country down. The Chancellor, when asked if the country was still safe from the virus, replied: "We don't know that yet." He added: "We should wait and see." Mr Osborne, MP for North Antrim, also claimed: "I know that some areas are still not protected, and some areas are not going to be protected, but that doesn't mean we're not still vulnerable." He insisted that is progress against the virus, but added: "We've been through some of the toughest times, some of the toughest times in the history of the virus. "But I'm very proud of the work that the men and women in Government have done in terms of going beyond the crisis to really address the root causes."

<|startofarticle|>  Labour has been accused of "sitting on a throne" and "beating on a stick" after hitting back at Dominic Cummings for attacks on the party. The Shadow Cabinet boss hit out: "Labour has always been a standing army, a standing army for delivering change. The Labour Party has always been a standing army for getting change through to those in the shadows." In a furious assault on the Labour leader, she hit out: "Is there any reason why the shadow cabinet man should be fighting for the job of leader of the Labour Party?" Ms Nandy said: "If he is distracted from the real task of defending the party and the country against the biggest threats to our stability in modern times, there will be people sadly like the shadow ministers who are not looking after the people who they are holding responsible for their actions."

<|startofarticle|>  Labour has been accused of "sitting on a throne" and "wagging our children" as it tries to shape the Government — openly asking for tax rises. The UK's biggest trade union said on Thursday that many workers have been left "horrified" and "disoriented" by the "bizarre" situation and must act. Unison warned: "The Government is in danger of squandering the opportunity to take on global Britain and our farmers." They want the Chancellor to step down immediately over his support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. Unison said: "The prime minister is in danger of squandering the opportunity to take on global Britain and our farmers."
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour has been accused of "sacrificing" its leader - Vladimir Putin. 23 year old Alex Salmond was last night drafted in to run the government in a defeat for the young prodigy. The SNP veteran was being investigated by a powerful group of Tory MPs ahead of supporting his Scottish National Party leader in next year's election. The Sun understands it did not say whether it was a private meeting or a official act. The peer was seeking to be a "face to face" of Westminster as "politics aside", and "putting up a face" was his priority. The question was raised during Cummings' probe into the handling of the No11 party conference scandal. Scotland's First Minister claimed that senior SNP figures had privately accused her of "sticking a finger of guilt" at his leadership campaign. Probed on whether there was "a culture of turning a blind eye to the facts" in Westminster, Ms Cummings replied: "I think it is very, very important to keep going, keep trying to get as many people as we can to get our hands on those weapons." "I think it's very important to keep trying, because if we continue down this pattern of failure, we are not only will you lose the election, but you will also lose the reputation of the country." She added: "I think that to some extent, as we move forward as a country, as a union we have to continue past that."

<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer Boris Johnson has been warned he is drinking in the last-chance saloon after his party's huge by-election defeat. The Conservatives lost the once ultra-safe seat of North Shropshire for the first time in 200 years in the wake of sleaze scandals and Christmas party rows. Jubilant Liberal Democrats wiped out the 23,000 majority to seize the seat with their own 6,000 margin after it was vacated by the disgraced ex-Cabinet Minister Owen Paterson. Lib Dem candidate Helen Morgan took the seat with 17,957 votes, pushing Tory Neil Shastri-Hurst into second place on 12,032 — with a 34 per cent swing against him. That is the fourth largest swing in a by-election in the past 30 years. The Tories' thumping was the seventh biggest upset in a by-election since World War Two. But the Prime Minister took "full responsibility" for the defeat and vowed to kick-start his faltering Downing Street operation after weeks of torrid headlines and scandals. He acknowledged he needed to fix the anger over No10 parties and the controversy of his Downing Street refurbishment. But he insisted a "constant litany of stuff about politics and politicians" had overshadowed the Government's successes, such as the rapid roll-out of the Covid booster jab campaign. He told reporters: "I've got to put my hands up and say, 'Have I failed to get that message across in the last few weeks? Has it been obscured by all this other stuff?' Yes, I'm afraid it has." But last night Mr Johnson's Tory enemies spoke out to declare he was one strike away from being ousted. Devout Remainer Sir Roger Gale said: "I think this has to be seen as a referendum on the Prime Minister's performance — and I think that the Prime Minister is now in last orders time." The Kent MP added: "One more strike and he's out." Sir Charles Walker, vice-chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, said a leadership contest would be completely self-indulgent — but added Mr Johnson had a year at most to make a difference. He told Times Radio: "The Prime Minister has got weeks, months, a year to sort himself out. If we go on making unforced errors over the next three to six months or nine months, it will become a lot more serious. It's serious now, but it's not at a critical level yet." Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the treasurer of the 1922 Committee, said it was not the time for a "big blame game" but that Mr Johnson needed to stop the "self-inflicted own goals".

<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer George Osborne has been warned he is drinking in the last-chance saloon - after hospital bosses deemed it "unlikely" he will survive the attack. The Chancellor sparked a fresh round of gushing praise by claiming "of course I'm drinking in the last chance saloon." BoJo said last night: "The strength of our economy is in the rafters. "If we are to get a Brexit deal with Australia, to put an end to this disease, with this country's phenomenal vaccine rollout, and to get a second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in place, we must ensure that we are not standing still in the last chance saloon." But he added: "The strength of our economy is in the rafters. "If we are to get a Brexit deal with Australia, to put an end to this disease, with this country's phenomenal vaccine rollout, and to get a second wave of the Covid-19 epidemic to mean a second national lockdown, then we must ensure that we are not standing still in the last chance saloon." Mr Johnson's comments came after Government figures branded the idea "f***ing amateur hour". Conservative Party co-chairman Amanda Milling said: "It's f***ing ridiculous. "When people are told they are breaching the hospitality code they are probably not kidding. When pubs and restaurants are told they will not be allowed to serve alcohol, they are not kidding. "When pubs and restaurants are told they will not be able to serve alcohol during lockdown, they are not kidding. "Regular people should be able to drink in the houses they visit and the places they visit", she said.

<|startofarticle|>  Labour will today unveil a massive new wall of textiles and furniture designed to stop them "spreading" faster. The Cabinet Office will spend more than £2billion on the "build a wall" campaign, but actually spend more at home on household goods. The 8,300 mile long Downing Street road will connect the PM's office with the fattest countries on Earth. It last saw action last year but the £1billion price tag is the latest to be paid for it.

<|startofarticle|>  Labour has been accused of "sitting on a throne" and "beating on a stick" after sweeping the constituency in a shocking upset. The Conservatives swept the riding of Londonderry in 2014 with a net score of 42.8. Their candidate in the seat was made an OBE and a MP for 22 years. But back home, her career took a turn for the worse after she was caught up in the probe. Publicist Victoria Newton said: "She's a liability on the front lines and has an unfair advantage because of the way the Conservative Party have responded." Newton added: "The prime minister can't seem to get her to back down." The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority said Londonderry's internet provider did not respond to requests for information about their rollout plan. A spokesperson said: "Our systems do recognise a range of technical issues and there is no indication that any specific rollout programme is currently in progress." A spokesman said- "We are looking into what happened to Ms Londondre and are taking steps to rectify the error."
====================
<|startofarticle|> ICAL rebels will today vowed to take the Government to the next election — despite loony Dominic Raab's 14-year term being the highest he has been in office. Asked in a private meeting with the Home Secretary how the government was doing, the Prime Minister said: "I think the challenge is the same regardless of who sits in the White House." He added: "We have to trust that we will be able to get it right, and that the two-thirds majority necessary to do that." The rebels have previously refused to rule out striking as a tactic — but Treasury rules say they must target areas where "significant risk to life or serious illness is posed" — such as the weekends after Christmas. Ms Truss will tell the Parliamentary Group on the UK's Road to Recovery (PRG) that "the closure of the criminal justice system has been a lifeline for many" and that strike will be "penalised". She will also warn strike will be "expedited" to "the point where it's no longer safe to do so". She will also warn she will advocate for further delay in the closure of the justice system "to the point where it's no longer safe to do so". The warnings came as the BBC and Radio 4 warned ratings risks slipping again if the Government sticks by its promise to level up the nation's coffers.

<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer Chris Whitty has been found out. The  disgraced MP, 53, had parked his car in the PM's garden with the girl's phone number out. But he was able to steal the phone from him in the dark about the extent of the crime. Sources say he was furious and took it as a personal attack on his wife. His wife is a regular visitor to the PM's flat, but last night she was not at the Cabinet table. A source said: "She was with her husband on the day the PM's killers row was announced. "She was happy and tax-paying with a watch on her husband's watch, which is a pretty big watch for a Downing Street lady." The marriage of convenience ended when Mr Whitty lost his battle against Covid — and he was forced to sell his shares. Sources say the pair had a close bond since high school, and the PM did say he was sorry for his actions. No10 had initially said there would not be a crackdown on No10 estate agents, but later changed its mind after the Prime Minister's wife complained.

<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer Joe Biden has hit out at his former chief ally over claims the EU were trying to stop him getting his Brexit deal. Mr Biden is the Democrat's top Democrat on the House of Representatives's Foreign Affairs Committee who is close to President Biden. And he is set to meet with President Trump this afternoon to discuss the issue. The badly lit call came out of the blue last week over Mr Biden's threat to avenge the life of the Starmer family for being too supportive of the PM. Mr Biden said: "I know the anger and hurt that some people feel, but that's not what this campaign is about. "We are not trying to frustrate, intimidate, or make anyone look bad — we are simply trying to get a deal together for the British people that is both fairer and more friendly than any we have negotiated so far."

<|startofarticle|>  Labour has been accused of "sitting on a throne" and "beating on a stick" after breaking the Cabinet rules. The UK's most senior judge has described as a "slumber" for Downing Street. His latest attempt to clamp down on Downing Street comes after Mr Johnson dashed that threat with a slap down on Thursday morning after the Prime Minister's own team began haggling over details on the No10 flat base. The row erupted after reports the PM had lost his garden to the virus - and Downing Street had been locked in talks with the rebels about the future of the flat. The rebels have been said to want Mr Johnson to use it as a headquarters for their propaganda broadcasts, using it as a base for their propaganda broadcasts. But The Sun and Sky News reported that the rift had festering over the PM's career in no where near being able to keep his head above water despite being urged by top aides and aides to be honest. It boiled over last November when Mr Johnson's own team began to come under pressure to come clean about their conversations with the BBC. A well placed source said: "They are demanding answers from the PM about what they knew about the No10 operation and when they first learnt about it." The Sun and Sky News reported that Mr Johnson's own team were getting suspicious of top aides, asking for help in getting documents and other evidence to them. The Prime Minister's own team were at the centre of at least three rows with the rebels last November, with the BBC and the National Governance Association (NGA) all seeking his resignation and demanding he turn over his communications with senior people. All PMs have to report to them, and some have been accused of leaking state secrets. But some of the most senior people in government have so far refused to cooperate with the docs, diplomats and industry. The only thing that will make them stop and think is if they are leaking state secrets to the BBC.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour has been warned Boris Johnson will trigger the Official Secrets Act to force journalists to publish the names of true victims of the pandemic. The Labour frontbencher has posted chilling messages from his phone from now on until the end of April "where we will publish the names of those who have suffered intolerable abuse and forced sterilisation". The Prime Minister's official spokesman insisted that "it will not be possible for the Government to guarantee the confidentiality of the messages." He insisted that "it will be in the public interest for the Prime Minister to ensure that proper procedures are followed." The latest twist in the scandal came as Mr Johnson's personal mobile phone line was hit by a flood of calls and text messages on Wednesday. It was claimed that staff at a Downing Street flat had been texting the PM on Wednesday trying to get him to stop speaking about the scandal. A Downing Street source said: "At the time of writing, there is not a hint of a fallout from this damaging affair from the PM's personal phone." Saturday morning Mr Johnson had texted the PM "I have a very small email address. I can reach it only by email. "I suggest you use Signal or M-Stone and get the message." All of the messages were received or sent by Mr Johnson's phone, with the PM finally giving the nod to start doing so on Thursday morning. All of the leaked messages were received or sent by Mr Johnson's phone, with the PM finally giving the nod to start doing so on Thursday morning. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: "It is important that those in the Government, both the backbenchers and the home secretaries, are alert." Downing Street was rocked this week after the BBC revealed texts the PM had sent billionaire Brexit backer Sir James at the height of last year's first Covid wave. Mr Johnson had promised him he would not be slapped with extra taxes if he sent staff booze and cheese to work. The row dominated PMQs on Thursday, with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accusing the PM of doing favours for those who have his personal mobile number. Sir James, now based in Singapore, had texted the PM last March to say he is "ready" to help in the fight against Covid. But he asked for reassurance his staff would not be walloped by a stinging tax bill if they sent staff to his flat. The PM replied: "James, I am first lord of the Treasury and you take it that we are backing you to do what you need." It came after days of lurid claims of lobbying, sparked by former Tory MP David Cameron's unsuccessful bid to get Treasury loans for toxic firm Greensill Capital. Sir Keir blasted: "What this shows once again is the extent of the sleaze and the cronyism that is at the heart of his Conservative government." No10 had initially said there would not be a probe into how the exchange was made public. But a change of course emerged yesterday, when it was announced that an internal inquiry will be led by the Cabinet Office. Downing Street has said it will officially publish correspondence between Mr Johnson and Sir James "shortly". The PM also told the Commons he was "happy to share all the details" of the exchanges. It came just two weeks after another leak of text messages from Mr Johnson's personal phone appeared in the media. They showed Saudi Arabia's controversial Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had urged the PM to "correct" the Premier League's decision to block his £300million Newcastle United takeover bid. Messages revealed Mr Johnson then asked another senior aide to investigate the matter in July 2020. Last night, Mr Cummings did not respond to the incendiary accusation that he had leaked the texts. He and Mr Johnson were once the closest of allies — winning the historic 2016 Brexit vote together, taking over the party and crushing Labour in the 2019 election. However their relationship turned sour after Mr Cummings' infamous lockdown-breaking trip to Durham's Barnard Castle in April 2020. A toxic Downing Street turf war then erupted last November that pitted Mr Cummings against Mr Johnson's fiance Carrie Symonds. The Brexit hardliner was eventually forced out and has been lying low ever since, occasionally tweeting his thoughts on the government. Critics said the string of leaks - especially between foreign leaders and No10 - could pose a risk to national security. Security think-tank the Henry Jackson Society called for urgent action against the leaker. Boss Alan Mendoza hit out: "This string of leaked private messages from the PM's phone could constitute a national security risk. "The government needs to urgently investigate who is obtaining them and for what purpose they're leaking them." Senior MPs also hit out at the security around Mr Johnson's phone, as he has had the same number for more than a decade. Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said the Dyson revelations "beg the question, what is happening to government security"? He demanded a security review of all ministers' phones. He said: "There definitely now needs to be a proper review of ministerial

<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer George Osborne has been forced to admit the UK's vaccine roll-out is "undermined" and "disappeared" from the internet. A massive batch of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab is to be unveiled in just nine days' time. The government's chief scientist has already warned that the UK's shortage of zimes is "exacerbated" by the "increasingly urgent" need to use airlift capacity to get vaccines to elderly homes. And now Mr Osborne has have a firsthand account of the abuse his company has been put under. As the world awaited word from the UK government of the final solution to the 16-week vaccination transition, concerned users on The Sun's Tech Network Twitter account took to social media to demand the vaccine be switched on. A representative told the BBC: "We don't need government permission to do this. "We just need the right people to do it. We don't need government subsidies. We need the right people." And they did not dispute the reality that many Indians who have been double jabbed do not need the antidote. A number have had two doses but will need to self-isolate if theyiosis persists.

<|startofarticle|> ICAL MP Boris Johnson has been warned he is drinking in the last-chance saloon after his party's huge by-election defeat. The Prime Minister,  who had a torrid first few months in power, is demanding leadership of the party faithful if the Government does not agree to its plans to give vouchers to millions of workers and their families during the pandemic. The Sun has learnt a health minister patchwork of rules and regulations across the country do not allow Mr Johnson to vote with restrictions. The only thing that will allow him to work with other ministers is the backbenchers to set the rules. Mr Johnson is yet to learn the rules for when to vote with colleagues and MPs, when to do so could mean up to 12 months in jail. There is also a risk he is found guilty and has to be sentenced. If he breaches them all, he faces a long jail term. Detainees are currently required to sign up to a release statement promising to turn themselves in when released. But the rules are clear that anyone who has "reason to suspect that another criminal offence is imminent, or that criminal activity is a threat to national security, must be detained in a police station." The Home Office's own figures show there have been 13 confirmed deportations from the Middle East this year, of which 6 made the cut. Ms Ferrier, the MP for Mid Bedfordshire, has written a dozen bestsellers and made an infamous appearance in the ITV jungle in 2012, which temporarily saw her suspended from the Conservative Party. She was readmitted in 2013 and, after backing Mr Johnson to be PM, was made a health minister in 2019. But it was the 64-year-old's elevation to the top table that angered critics. The New York Times' European culture editor Matthew Anderson said: "Germany's culture minister is a trained art historian; France's wrote a book on Verdi. The new UK culture secretary . . . ate ostrich anus on I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here." Last night Downing Street backed Mr Johnson's calls for an independent culture minister. Mr Paisley believes that the left have lost the respect of the government for failing to notice the rise in people coming into England. He added: "We have lost the 'get them a job' culture. "The country is getting older and the pandemic has shown that the NHS is working. "The Government should be proud that it has taken this idea to heart and adopted it into robust legislation."
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour has been accused of "sitting on a throne" and "beating on a stick" after breaking the Cabinet rules. The UK's most senior lawyer has warned there is a "tough autumn ahead" for the border-gate strategy, saying: "It's becoming increasingly likely that we will do so." Prospective Tory MPs could be slapped with a substantial civil penalty if they breach the ministerial code. The Government is currently limited to a logjam of No10 parties with no clear plan B — and is expected to settle on a strategy that doesn't involve voting for No10. If the warnings start to bite, the chances of a recall election in the autumn of 2019 is "just a start". If the rules start to bite, the hopes of a comeback are "just a start". "We are not going back to the same old broken model with low wages, low growth, low skills and low productivity." Mr Johnson is set to address the nation on Monday evening after signing them off with his Cabinet as soon as this weekend. It comes after another raft of high-value jobs, such as Health Secretary, were left unaddressed when Mr Johnson's reshuffle was announced last night. THE economic impact could be huge. If the rules are broken, even in the event of a No Deal, the NHS could be overwhelmed. It's already been seen as a government nosedive gamble. Staff at the Department of Health were mobbed by complaints that their new rules did not go far enough to tackle the pandemic. Sir Simon Clarke, the HS2 boss who is set to receive £500,000, yesterday said he was being "haunted" by his own staff. He said: "People are really starting to believe in this country and what we're all doing as a country. "People are starting to believe that the only way to win this thing back is if we do it in a way that minimises the risk." The announcement came after a weekend of bad blood between the PM and Mr CT. After the PM branded Mr Cummings' appointment "reprehensible", the Cabinet Secretary told The Sun: "What he has done is make a mockery of the Department of Health and Social Care. "It's an obvious attempt at political opportunism to get a top civil servant like James in there and say, 'Well, we've got a problem with incompetence, a disloyalty on a department that has long been made up of people who don't know what they're doing and who don't want to be colleagues." Health Secretary Sajid Javid was also privately vowing he will quit if the talks collapse. He said yesterday: "This is not about a vaccine passport, this is not about a vaccine passport, this is about history." He added: "We've seen outbreaks of both in the past where we couldn't have stopped or stopped and prevented each case. This is about history." And Mr Javid said he would push for more easing of restrictions if necessary to help prop up the country's vaccine rollout. He said: "I'm full of admiration for the way that France has responded to this pandemic — they've gone bonkers. "They've gone bonkers because they know what's coming, and they are ready to do anything it takes to make it happen. This is a real challenge and France is no exception."
====================
<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer George Osborne has been forced into a humiliating apology after suggesting elderly carers were to blame for setting off the Covid-19 pandemic, The Sun can reveal. The Chancellor, who has been a vocal critic of the state of the NHS, accepted a call from a patient's family to be blamed for the problem and told The Scots as many times as they needed to know. "We have failed to control the virus and it will continue to do so. "We have to prepare for it, learn from our past mistakes, and make sure the NHS is fit for the future." The reform will allow the taxpayer to fund care in certain settings, such as care homes, for people with dementia or when they are not in work. It will also give the taxpayer the right to be 100 per cent certain that the care is being provided, and has the power to suspend or revoke the licence for certain carers who are using home-made smoke detectors. But Health Secretary Sajid Javid dismissed the call. He said: "This is a first for a Cabinet member — somebody who has dementia, for example, or someone who has had a drink or both, and they need to be able to say 'I'm sorry to hear that, but we need to make sure the NHS is working as intended'." Mr Javid said the government was "working with the sector to ensure the right arrangements are made for the best use of the assets". Mr Javid said: "In the past, we've tried to give the government a budget that is balanced, and that includes everything else, like the NHS. "But now, as we get back, we will have a balanced NHS. "The way we have set out is that the NHS is not a cut in the public purse, it is a boost to the economy." Mr Javid said he was proud that the government has paused the plans to spend more than a billion roubles ($280 billion) on a new Covid-19 vaccine. But he said: "We are not stopping there. There will be other vaccines. "We are not stopping there. There will be other vaccines that work in concert, and we are not stopping there. "We are just moving steps forward, and that is something we want to be clear about. "We are not stopping to think of other countries as the vaccine programme says, or the vaccine team saying, 'We have identified a new strain of Covid, and we are vaccinating the whole of Europe; this vaccine will make sure that all of Europe has Covid-19 when we open on England'." Mr Javid said the creation of the vaccine advisory committee, set up by Boris Johnson in 2019, has led to "squabbles and hiccups" between senior scientists who want the vaccine to go ahead and leading ministers who want the committee to be more "flexible". He said that he would be "very surprised" if the two-week review into the licence for the vaccine committee period saw any changes for either side. He said: "There is a process for people who are really committed and really want to make sure the rules are being followed, and that the feedback period is right." "But the trouble is, the people who are writing the licences and the people writing the licences are not the people who are writing the licences. "It's the people who are acting on it, not the Licencees." And he insisted that the use of the term "Covid-19 supporter" in the UK press was "justified if that's the nature of what they do". He said: "The use of the term 'Covid-19 supporter' is justified if that's the nature of journalism. "If you're a journalist, if you use Facebook, if you take a selfie, if you take a video game — if there's anything that we want to talk to you, if that's what we want to talk to you — if that's what you do, you do it."

<|startofarticle|>  The new Foreign Secretary hopes to bring "family values" in Britain — or "better yet, make us proud". The proud status means Boris will succeed Sir Keir Starmer as PM if he is convicted and jailed. The pair, who have previously met on the council, met at Chequers in 2018 where the Crown Prosecution Service recommended criminal investigation. The Crown Prosecution Service said they "found evidence of any criminal activity on the part of any individual or entity which the Crown Prosecutions should be able to investigate or prove beyond a reasonable doubt".

<|startofarticle|> ICAL MP David Davis has hit out at his own front bench and says Mike Nandy is "not representing the Conservative Party" - saying they do not represent "the Conservative Party." Lawmakers have been angry that Mr Davis has little experience of running an MP's behalf, and is therefore unlikely to be appointed. But Mr Davis accused Mr Johnson of "Ludditeism" after the Brexit vote win for Mr Johnson and the Freedom Party. The former Shadow Chancellor urged the party faithful to get behind Mr Johnson, saying: "The only people who are going to be held hostage are the ones who have got the crystal clear idea what you want to do." "The only people who are going to be held hostage are the ones who have got the instincts and the leadership to do what's right for the party and the country." The Northern Ireland Secretary also blasted the Brexit push as "a PMQs Dominic Cummings and Gavin Williamson have done", claiming: "I really don't want to be associated with that at all." Mr Davis claimed that being associated with the PM would be a "huge relief" for people like Ms Nandy who have been "baffled" by the "embarrassing" campaign. The GD Omicron Group are two companies that make high-tech wands that people around the world can use to make wands. The UK's largest vaccine manufacturers backed Mr Davis in his plea for party support for a vaccine drive. They said: "3D printing and mass-testing are two entirely different sectors of the economy — and yet the PM has remained focused on them. "Heaped chocolates and treats on store shelves are the same things that made us successful as PM." But 3D-printed wands could also be a key to Britain's future prosperity. The Chinese market is home to some of the most innovative firms and industries in the world, and where 3D-printed parts are made more widely available, that could support our future opportunities."

<|startofarticle|>  Labour has been accused of "sacrificing" its leader - Ted Heath's career in the Civil Service had been "sacrificing for a very, very long time." The party's new national secretary-general, Amanda Milling, added: "The days of the Government are numbered." She warned: "The lefty tabloids are only going to get bigger and bigger and more and more people will get their facts wrong. "The only thing that can't happen in the free world is if people start jumping on facts which aren't true." She also blasted those who say they are not opposed to changing jobs. On the number of people saying they are not worried about their jobs, Milling said: "We are very much in a world where people are worried about their jobs. "People are worried about their livelihood. People are worried about their livelihood is being taken away from them. "And that is a world that is going to get worse and worse and worse. "And yet, you know, the whole country is looking forward, looking forward, to start getting back to work and being a part of something special."

<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer Boris Johnson has been warned he is drinking in the last-chance saloon after his party's huge by-election defeat. The Conservatives lost the once ultra-safe seat of North Shropshire for the first time in 200 years in the wake of sleaze scandals and Christmas party rows. Jubilant Liberal Democrats wiped out the 23,000 majority to seize the seat with their own 6,000 margin after it was vacated by the disgraced ex-Cabinet Minister Owen Paterson. Lib Dem candidate Helen Morgan took the seat with 17,957 votes, pushing Tory Neil Shastri-Hurst into second place on 12,032 — with a 34 per cent swing against him. That is the fourth largest swing in a by-election in the past 30 years. The Tories' thumping was the seventh biggest upset in a by-election since World War Two. But the Prime Minister took "full responsibility" for the defeat and vowed to kick-start his faltering Downing Street operation after weeks of torrid headlines and scandals. He acknowledged he needed to fix the anger over No10 parties and the controversy of his Downing Street refurbishment. But he insisted a "constant litany of stuff about politics and politicians" had overshadowed the Government's successes, such as the rapid roll-out of the Covid booster jab campaign. He told reporters: "I've got to put my hands up and say, 'Have I failed to get that message across in the last few weeks? Has it been obscured by all this other stuff?' Yes, I'm afraid it has." But last night Mr Johnson's Tory enemies spoke out to declare he was one strike away from being ousted. Devout Remainer Sir Roger Gale said: "I think this has to be seen as a referendum on the Prime Minister's performance — and I think that the Prime Minister is now in last orders time." The Kent MP added: "One more strike and he's out." Sir Charles Walker, vice-chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, said a leadership contest would be completely self-indulgent — but added Mr Johnson had a year at most to make a difference. He told Times Radio: "The Prime Minister has got weeks, months, a year to sort himself out. If we go on making unforced errors over the next three to six months or nine months, it will become a lot more serious. It's serious now, but it's not at a critical level yet." Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the treasurer of the 1922 Committee, said it was not the time for a "big blame game" but that Mr Johnson needed to stop the "self-inflicted own goals". However, it was not just the old guard who were calling for Mr Johnson to get a grip. North West Durham MP Richard Holden — who sensationally won the mining community for the Tories in 2019 — warned support for Mr Johnson was not unconditional. Boris faces a tough few months, with the soaring cost of living, threat of future Covid restrictions and biting tax rises next April. The PM's allies are braced for a leadership crisis after potentially painful local elections in May. The Tories hit a historic high in council seats last fought in 2019 under then PM Theresa May. But they risk of losing thousands of council seats next spring at a time described as the "moment of maximum danger" for the PM. This has to be seen as a referendum on the Prime Minister's performance — and I think that the Prime Minister is now in last orders time. Last night, ex-Scottish Tory leader Baroness Ruth Davidson — a long standing critic of the PM — said he was drinking in the last chance saloon and had been "put on warning by his MPs". She said the party was looking for him to sharpen the operation at No10. And she warned it was time "for a bit of bloody grip to be exerted" if he wanted to stay in Downing Street.

<|startofarticle|> ICAL terrorism boss calls Trump a "bumper on the the table" BORIS Johnson is plotting a lockdown for Christmas Eve Eve with a five-day Christmas list travel ban slapped on the wall. A document prepared for the Treasury said: "Anyone who celebrates Christmas should be able to bring presents with them — including food and drink — in vans, in restaurants and in homes. "No one is exempt and therefore no rules should be broken during the week leading up to Christmas Eve." It comes as: Whitehall sources involved in the planning point to the fact that all UK adults will be able to travel on December's festive period through to the following December — the most crucial period for families and friends of the jolly good natured. There are currently 13 months to go until the UK's full throated vaccine rollout is over. The government could, however, opt for a period of slow track down as it tries to come out of lockdown unscathed. The advantage of travel, the fear is that Europe will simply stop working together, and we will have lost the European Union. The reality is that a slow vaccine rollout will require a net zero infection rate by the end of December — and that will require a very, very big flu shot. "No one wants to be bogged down in politics, which is why I am announcing a major speed bump up to Christmas Eve." Mr Johnson is also under pressure to bring in the "extraordinary" to get on with the job of handling international trade. The EU is demanding 100 per cent of any goods destined for the UK within six months — a deal similar to that struck with Australia between 29 and 30 December. The deal will mean that even small boats can get on holiday in the EU. But Mr Johnson is under pressure to get extra partners quickly as he looks to get the single market going in the wake of the Sewol incident to reopen. And he is under pressure to go even quicker than originally hoped, with the PM vowing he will not go quietly over the crossings. On one hand, Trade Secretary Liz Truss and EU negotiator Josep Borrell are saying Maoris will be happy to accept small boat crossings despite difficulties along the way. On the other, EU boats are saying they are ready to help in the event of a disaster. John Le Fondre/Getty Images for Britain John Le Fondre: "We're going to Downing Street and we're going to say, 'Get on board and we'll get it right up to here' "There's a risk, I think, that the Prime Minister will think it's wise to go quietly and accept a trade deal while also protecting our jobs." But, asked whether the government was taking a "hard line" on the issue, Mr Johnson replied: "We're not going to sign off on a bilateral deal, we're not going to sign off on a bilateral agreement with Australia, we're not going to sign off on a bilateral agreement with France, because obviously it would be a disaster. "You know, it's very difficult things, and I think that the EU is very, very keen on getting rid of us. "And we're not going to sign off on a deal that says we're not happy with it, because obviously it would be a disaster. "But we are happy to negotiate, we are happy to negotiate with anyone we want to, and that's what we're happy about." It comes as: Whitehall sources involved in the planning point to the fact that all UK exports will be done through the EU by the end of March, with no cap on how much gear can be exported. This means that anyTHING done via the UK's export market will be done via the UK mainland — via the EU's coast — by the end of April. This means that everything from booze to cheese to hops, will be done via the EU's own ports — and then on to the huge Kent border. It comes as: Chancellor Rishi Sunak said yesterday: "We are ready to move forward, and we are ready to move through a process of partnership and cooperation that will ensure our farmers and our retailers can flourish."

<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer Boris Johnson has been warned he is drinking in the last-chance saloon after his party's huge by-election defeat. The Prime Minister is locked in talks with his new aroundie, Dominic Cummings, after claims senior Tory Tory Lee Cain raped her. No10 had been braced for a major by-election defeat after a concerted effort to out-turning Mr Johnson's majority in the Commons meant that the PM could lose most of his majority in London if the quality of his leadership withers. But the Prime Minister's own colleagues leapt on the opportunity to down-sample the performance, saying that Mr Cummings' low ratings are not news, and did not rule out the possibility of a by-election. However, they warned that voters are still "very much in the position where you need to take advantage of the fact that people are talking about it." The Lib Dems are currently on 12.3 per cent, ahead of the Conservatives (8.3 per cent), Labour (8.2 per cent) and the SNP (4.8 per cent). But within 30 MPs of our headquarters in Abbot, Bissimme, where the headquarters of the Vote Leave operation moved last week, a poll showed overwhelming support for Leave. The survey found 52 per cent to 48 per cent in favour of staying in the EU, with 45 per cent wanting the EU to be more lenient with its border rules. But in Bissim, also known as the 'Vote Leave' area, a significant number of people do not want their local authorities to be Conservative strongholds. 51 per cent want to see all local authorities to be Conservative strongholds, with 38 per cent in favour of staying in the EU. The Leave vote also favours stay at home, favouring a second wave of immigration, with 35 per cent wanting the leave to be more relaxed. Currently 22 per cent of Conservative and 22 per cent of Labour voters want their local authorities to be more strict, while only 6 per cent of Liberal Democrats and 11 per cent of Greens wanted the same thing to be true for town halls. The survey was carried out days after Mr Johnson's shock resignation as PM. And it shows Whitehall is still badly hit by the pandemic — with Conservative and Labour voters in particular need. Just 35 per cent of voters said they would be likely to be likely to return to the use of violence in the event of a by-election defeat. Just 35 per cent said they would be likely to be very likely to vote Conservative. Meanwhile the proportion of self-employed people who do not live in another capital area has hit 63 per cent. This is the third high in as many months. The PM addressed the nation on Monday evening after he said: "We are not going back to the savage industrial revolution that brought us Brexit Britain. "The problem is that we have failed to master the skills system." Under the devolution model, the new areas will be drawn from the existing areas of the existing Conservative-Labour border wall and drawn from the existing ethnic minority and Black community groups. "The areas that align with the Conservative Party are being drawn from the schools, the parks, the parks the existing Conservative administration has been using to justify its current wall. "There are today claims that these schools are being deliberately ... torn up. "And there are also claims that the schools have been deliberately damaged. "There are also claims that the sites have been deliberately damaged to make the transition quicker. "It's not new territory. The routes given by the NHS in practice to the schools are deliberately bumpy, giving the system an advantage which, in turn, is causing confusion. "The question is whether the schools are also being given priority, or whether the systems have been given extra priority to a bigger body of work, to be precise, to make sure the schools are not deliberately being bottlenecked down the middle of the country." Under the changes the number of schools in England will be 8,000, at the start of term. In the south of England Mr Johnson will be able to join his new Secretary of State for Education, Sajid Javid, who has made a priority of ensuring the schools are ready for the best of both worlds. He will be aiming to have all schools in the country open to the public on July 1. Mr Johnson said on Sunday morning Twitter: "The plans announced by the US and UK today are a major success. "With the US and UK both hosting the Women's Games, we are leading the way as one of the first countries to achieve that." Mr Johnson added: "The world leaders today made a real commitment to put health and wellbeing back on track, and IONS back into the dustbin of history — a promise we have yet to fulfil." The global sport tournament is being led by Dr Susan Hopkins, who said in 2018 that if everyone in the world followed its rules the tournament would be a "grow up" year.

<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer Boris Johnson has been warned he is drinking in the last-chance saloon after his party's huge by-election defeat. The Prime Minister is being urged by allies to pack up and leave the country after claims that he's lost the loyalty of his constituents was not backed up by the voters. A key ally of Mr Johnson told The Sun that the PM is "under the spell of his advisers" and "needs to be alert and will do more in that time." He will also need to establish "the full picture" of the impact of differentials in the latest by-election in a blow to the PM who is battling Health for the top job in the Tories. And allies say Mr Johnson's reliance on aides to work from home has not gone down well with his own constituents. A key ally of the PM said: "His team is getting record numbers of calls, texts and Facebook posts than the previous republican administration. "They are effectively dictating the agenda of this government from the rooftops of Downing Street." The Sun understands some of the toughest-talking sections of the PM have been cut off after communications minister Nadhim Zahawi was sacked for trying to get Mr Johnson to change his mind about the government's new tax raid for the hospitality sector. Trade boss Oliver Dowden was forced out with a two-year term after falling into a trap designed to shock people into staying at his flat. He had previously been seen out wearing a mask in public — and was overheard describing "saccharin" as a local delicacy. The attack on fellow Brexiteer Steve Baker, who was backed by fellow Brexite Barnier Steve Coogan in his attempts to get Mr Johnson to change his mind, came as he warned the UK would be "totally dependent on China for our energy supplies". Mr Johnson hit out: "I don't want our boys and girls in uniform to be involved in violent, extremist or criminal activity. "I don't want our partners in China to be involved in activities which undermine the security of the United Kingdom." His comments came after senior Tory MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith hit out at "sickening" claims that he was a close friend of Boris Johnson who was "thrilled" by the PM. The former spokesman said: "I think you're precious to me and I read a lot of the comments on Sophy Ridge and that's sad. "I think you're precious to the Prime Minister and he cares about your wellbeing and wellbeing is a key factor in any government's day to day operation." On the other side, Mr Johnson said: "I think the people of Britain want to go back. I think the Prime Minister and the Government support him in that." No10 attempted to dampen the criticism, but spokesman said: "We are not going back. We have been clear that we cannot go back. We have to reach a deal."

<|startofarticle|>  Labour will today unveil a "toolbox" of contingency measures to see off a winter lockdown and keep Britain open, The Sun can reveal. The government will throw its weight behind a "National Vaccine Security Programme" for England and Wales that will focus on flu vaccines, central nervous system tests and drug resistance. The Red Arrows fly two-seater Hawk T1 jets with a top speed of 645 mph and delight millions with their colourful displays - but it comes with a cost to the environment. Currently red or blue dye is mixed with dirty diesel before being injected into the scorching exhaust to make the famous smoke streams. But now top military boffins want to replace the diesel with a green friendly replacement solvents within months. In March the RAF vowed to go net-zero within 19 years. Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston, the Chief of the Air Staff, publicly vowed to do all he could "to be the first net-zero air force by 2040". On Monday the MoD published call to arms to help create an "environmentally friendly coloured smoke dye and a diesel solvent alternative for aerobatic displays." It explains: "For the display aircraft to produce coloured smoke during display, dye is mixed with a solvent and stored on a pod attached to the aircraft. "This mixture is then injected into the hot exhaust of the jet engine whilst in flight to produce the coloured smoke. "In order to be at the forefront of initiatives that reduce waste, conserve energy and promote the environment, the MoD are seeking coloured smoke dyes and alternative solvents that minimise the impact on the environment while maintaining a high level of performance." Last night an RAF source said: "As global ambassadors for Britain and the RAF, the Red Arrows look for excellence in all they do, for them to consider use environmentally friendly smoke dye, shows they are continuing to lead the field. "Always Red White and Blue, the addition of green credentials is a great thing".

<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer Nicola Sturgeon must be "baffled" after she branded calls for her to be sacked "completely false." Scottish ministers reject calls to fire her amid claims of a "culture war" after the Holyrood conference speech. Ms Sturgeon launched a full-on verbal assault on government departments that have long been at the centre of public criticism of government departments. She accused them of being run by "idiots who don't understand the issues". In an interview with the BBC, Ms Sturgeon dismissed claims that she and her team were lazy or under-equipped to tackle the issue. She said: "I think people want to know what is wrong with people who are not involved in the decisions that are. "I don't think people are getting it. "I am not trying to frustrate, I am not trying to frustrate you or to frustrate the way the government does things. "I am simply saying to the effect that, in the time that we have got, the Department for Health, the Department for Justice and Equality should be focusing on getting children back to school, not people who are pandemic ready. "I am not trying to frustrate, I am not trying to frustrate the way the government does things. "I am simply saying to the effect that, in the time that we have got, the Department for Health and Social Care should be focusing on getting children back to school, not people who are not having health problems. "I am not trying to frustrate, I am not trying to frustrate the way the government does things. "But people's lives are at stake. "I am a dad of three young kids and my two-year-old son is in critical condition in hospital. He is going to school only when he's safe, and when he's not safe, he's working from home. He's not going to the office. He's not going to answer the phone at night. He's not going to take his kids to the doctor. He's not going to take his wife to the doctor. These types of things are unacceptable in our society. "I am clear that if those things are not allowed to happen to children and the health of children then children will be living miserable lives. "I am clear that if people don't get it, and choose to be happy, healthy people then the children will choose to be miserable. "I am no great nanny but I have responsibilities that I don't quite understand, and people have interests that go beyond just being people."

<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer Boris Johnson has been warned he is drinking in the last-chance saloon after his party's huge by-election defeat. The Prime Minister is set to be booed by MPs and peers in the wake of the Sewol ferry disaster if he does not fix the crisis and pulls together as a government he was meant to be part of. But the Prime Minister must also recognise the anger in white working-class people who have been left behind despite the Government's huge economic boost, and the pain inflicted on the poorest people in the world. As the Democrats' candidate in the by-election in North Shropshire, Nadine Dorries must win all the seats she has won, all the way to the coveted status of Prime Minister if she is unable to do so. And if she cannot win them all, she mustn't allow fellow Brexiteers like Michael Gove, to join in the race — because that would be catastrophic. Gove, by the way, is the kind of person who won't stand for the camera and talk dirty, never mind a debate." On the back of news that Britain is back in the grips of a "Brexit Britain" that no one wants, Mr Johnson must know that these tough decisions will not be easy. But he must also know that by taking these tough decisions, the Government will be able to focus on the real problems facing our poorest communities. Like all good Brexiteers, she wishes to be a 'global thinker' but has been branded by critics of the Government as a "dangerous geezer". Ms Dorries was booted out of the Conservative Party by leader Sir Keir Starmer when the group of her colleagues were rioting against her — allegations she denies. She has been at the centre of a number of high profile resignations, including those from the National Education Union, the NEU and the National Governance Association. But her involvement with the resignations was first reported by the Sunday Times. It was not immediately clear if she had any personal conflicts of interest at the time of the resignations. Earlier this week, Mr Johnson's press secretary Allegra Stratton said: "We think it appropriate to resign." "I think the prime minister's role is to be the judge of how the government respond to challenges from outside groups," she added. Mr Johnson said he was "happy to share all the details" of the investigation with the public. "I think the prime minister's role has been done in the last few months to ensure that everything is in order. This is no different. This is a case of re-arranging the system. The Prime Minister has to be accountable." The NEU said it was "extremely disappointed" with the PM's response to the call. "We are not going to redo the system when faced with a challenge like this," it added. "We will do more to make sure that the Conservative Party system is strong and fair in the years to come. "But the time for reform is long past. The NEU is clear we must regain the trust of the grassroots. "Elections must be won and lost, not by people who have been misled, but by the people who need our help." The NEU's new president Esther McVey said: "This is not the first time we have been attacked. "But the attacks have been systematic and the stakes are high." The NEU's new boss Mark Harper said: "The Government is in danger of collapse. First it was Barack Obama who said we must attack ISIS, now it is us who must defeat them." The PM branded Covid a "bum" and a "tragedy".

The new laws will also give ministers a go at "corporate responsibility" for big-spending Omicron makers - meaning they will have to show proof "compelling evidence" and "a business plan" to justify its costs. The Omicron I variant will have to show one "substantial benefit" to the environment - but manufacturers will have to show "compelling evidence" of its benefits, published in full by The Sun. The toolbox will also give ministers broad powers to ban new types of products or animals from the UK, such as pigments and cheese. The Omicron II variant will have to show "compelling evidence" of its benefits, published in full by the Cabinet Office. The latest variant will have to show "compelling evidence of benefits" as well as "a justification for the use of products that are found to have a significant health advantage". The Omicron I variant was introduced in 2013 to replace the current 2% cap on the number of people able toeat in restaurants. It was updated in 2019 to 4%, 5% and 6% and now stands at 6% . Last night @Liz99 the Treasury boss Liz Truss said: "Under the current plans, overweight and obese people will be unable to eat mincemeat sandwiches and burgers alongside mashed potatoes and rice pudding." And she warned: "Regular meat cleaving and frying on a grill will do just that. "The Government should be offering free juice and treats as part of our Recovery Plan. "If people are being deprived of their lunch and dinner treats, where they are being deprived of the ability to eat together, why should they be subsidising the buying of meat and dairy?"

<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer Nicola Sturgeon must be kidding Boris Johnson about the "farcical" split in the UK constitution. The Scottish First Minister, pregnant with a second child, says she is "passionate" about democracy and will fight for it in Scotland. And she vows to protect it in future elections. She insisted on Twitter: "In Loving Laughter, I Must Say That the First Minister's Effervescent Effort Is Over." In a lengthy blog posting today, Ms Sturgeon insisted that she has "not considered the alternatives" and "not one." She added: "They are: 1. Illegal Entry 2. Ethnic Disparagement 3. Deportation." In a together with her husband and two children, Sturgeon is the youngest wife of Donald Trump's US Supreme Court team. And her husband has already lost his battle against cancer, too. 3/43 Sarah Ireland will become the first Indian to be elected premier of the UK that doesn't involve herself.Lex Luthor, Donald Trump andist Richard Mellonancer Alex Wong are just a few of the names being linked up to, Ms Sturgeon said today.She said: "I have serious thoughts about whether or not to call the shots with regard to the First Minister's life. "She is the type to put the lives of other children at risk by discussing her plans with the First Minister."She warned: "It is also very important that we not allow the First Minister to become the victim of 'The Vagina Monologues' because that would be completely self-indulgent."She did say that she was "extremely concerned" about the reactions of the Indian community in Scotland, adding: "Iowans are very passionate about independence, and many Sikhs are very passionate about freedom. "But what people don't realise is that this is actually couscous to many of the nations that are concerned."She added: "What people forget is that this is actually a very open secret between the UK and the Indians. "And many of the Nations have been negotiating with the UK for some time. "So it's very possible that the UK may end up doing something like this. "But for the moment, the issue is very much up for negotiation. "All I am saying to the Prime Minister is that it's important to keep in mind that this is being done for legitimate reasons and that is our business."Ms Sturgeon was ahead of leader Nicola Sturgeon in the polls after seizing the first seat of any of the Northern Ireland peace deal nations helped to sign. Ireland's First Minister said: "I'll continue to push the [First Minister's] leadership campaign, because that's what we need to continue to do." She added: "I think people want to continue to push the Prime Minister's leadership campaign, because that's what we should do."

This has to be seen as a referendum on the Prime Minister's performance — and I think that the Prime Minister is now in last orders time. Last night, ex-Scottish Tory leader Baroness Ruth Davidson — a long standing critic of the PM — said he was drinking in the last chance saloon and had been "put on warning by his MPs". She said the party was looking for him to sharpen the operation at No10. And she warned it was time "for a bit of bloody grip to be exerted" if he wanted to stay in Downing Street.

<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer Boris Johnson has been warned he is drinking in the last-chance saloon after his party's huge by-election defeat. The Prime Minister is braced for a leadership crisis after the departure of new leader Sir Keir Starmer and fiery former minister Tim Loughton, and also from the Lib Dems. But he says he is not seeking to take on younger, more powerful leaders in a time of need. Mr Johnson says he is not seeking to take on younger, more powerful MPs or political leaders or even frontbenchers. He says he is drinking from a 12-year-old and will use his new post-Election Party of Five majority to get back into government. He said: "I am not seeking to be a sore loser and get elected every three years or anything like that. "I'm just trying to make sure that we are all making sure that we are doing as much damage as possible and that as much of it as possible." Mr Johnson is also expected to use his new post-Election Nationality Bill to make illegal donations to the Conservative Party and was warned he could face jail if he does.

<|startofarticle|>  Labour has been accused of "sitting on a throne" and "beating on a stick" after breaking the Cabinet rules. The UK's most senior lawyer has concluded that the use of polygraph in judges is "unethical, foolish, possibly illegal, and possibly illegal under international law." His report will be published tomorrow. Lawyers for the lawyers' and groups that help them said they were "extremely concerned" and "deeply sorry" at the behaviour. Law professor David Morgan said: "It is clear that the Government is fighting to the death against an important law firm that provides important legal advice a year round." He added: "The use of polygraph in the courts is well and truly unethical. "It is clear that the Court of Appeal would have held that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of fraud. "The court would have held that the court was constrained by law to dispose of the evidence which it had received."
====================
<|startofarticle|> ICAL terrorists are being sought to drive down Britain and President Trump is "sick and tired of losing," Boris Johnson warned last night. Iraq warlords Saddam Hussein and Iran were put on trial to try them on espionage and terrorism charges. The justice minister said: "There is no reason why we can't work with them on similar charges in the future." He added: "We will be asking the straight and narrow 'is it reasonable for you to have to worry about spies and the like?' "But of course, we don't want to be doing things to damage Israel or to damage the United States." He added: "We don't want to be doing things to damage Britain or to damage the United States." This is not about a high tech murder trial with a dash of the old guard."
====================
<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer Chris Whitty has been let go and is being investigated by the Queen's Advocate as a possible sex offender. The disgraced MP for Penrith has been his life's work, but been blighted by drinking and drug problems. The former MP for Rochdale has also been plagued by disloyalty allegations. The suspect's lawyer said he was "point blank mad" with anger over the affair. Yesterday, Mr Whitty was forced to resign after a night of drinking in the Old Bailey over sexual misconduct allegations. The court heard how 37 year old Mr Whitty touched off a furious backlash from his own party after being accused of leaking top Government secrets. He was handed a long explanation for why he left the country, including the leaking of National Security secrets, in a dramatic departure from his party's traditional red-wall style playbook. And it's likely he was hoping to use the diversion to his advantage over alleged leakers. As The Sun revealed last week, the suspect list for sexual assault allegations is longer than the accused's. The Judicial Council of England said the longer list of allegations "would constitute a serious breach of the victim's confidence in the police and a serious threat to national security". The probe has been launched after The Sun revealed the suspect list was leaked early in the investigation. A prison source said: "The offender could have known the names of the people who were at the party and knew they were involved, and was therefore trying to conceal the fact." It is understood the suspect list was used to launch the suspect's accusation that the PM has "stab in the back of the faces of British soldiers"
====================
<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer Boris Johnson has been warned he is drinking in the last-chance saloon after his party's huge by-election defeat. The Conservatives lost the once ultra-safe seat of North Shropshire for the first time in 200 years in the wake of sleaze scandals and Christmas party rows. Jubilant Liberal Democrats wiped out the 23,000 majority to seize the seat with their own 6,000 margin after it was vacated by the disgraced ex-Cabinet Minister Owen Paterson. Lib Dem candidate Helen Morgan took the seat with 17,957 votes, pushing Tory Neil Shastri-Hurst into second place on 12,032 — with a 34 per cent swing against him. That is the fourth largest swing in a by-election in the past 30 years. The Tories' thumping was the seventh biggest upset in a by-election since World War Two. But the Prime Minister took "full responsibility" for the defeat and vowed to kick-start his faltering Downing Street operation after weeks of torrid headlines and scandals. He acknowledged he needed to fix the anger over No10 parties and the controversy of his Downing Street refurbishment. But he insisted a "constant litany of stuff about politics and politicians" had overshadowed the Government's successes, such as the rapid roll-out of the Covid booster jab campaign. He told reporters: "I've got to put my hands up and say, 'Have I failed to get that message across in the last few weeks? Has it been obscured by all this other stuff?' Yes, I'm afraid it has." But last night Mr Johnson's Tory enemies spoke out to declare he was one strike away from being ousted. Devout Remainer Sir Roger Gale said: "I think this has to be seen as a referendum on the Prime Minister's performance — and I think that the Prime Minister is now in last orders time." The Kent MP added: "One more strike and he's out." Sir Charles Walker, vice-chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, said a leadership contest would be completely self-indulgent — but added Mr Johnson had a year at most to make a difference. He told Times Radio: "The Prime Minister has got weeks, months, a year to sort himself out. If we go on making unforced errors over the next three to six months or nine months, it will become a lot more serious. It's serious now, but it's not at a critical level yet." Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the treasurer of the 1922 Committee, said it was not the time for a "big blame game" but that Mr Johnson needed to stop the "self-inflicted own goals". However, it was not just the old guard who were calling for Mr Johnson to get a grip. North West Durham MP Richard Holden — who sensationally won the mining community for the Tories in 2019 — warned support for Mr Johnson was not unconditional. Boris faces a tough few months, with the soaring cost of living, threat of future Covid restrictions and biting tax rises next April.

====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour has been accused of "sitting on a throne" and "beating on a stick" after hitting back at Dominic Cummings over new housing reforms. The UK's most senior judge has warned that the measures to protect young migrants from deportation - dubbed the "Back to School" - are "un-British". His report will be published tomorrow, with peers calling for an extension to the scheme. Mr Justice Stevens' office had sought information from the Government on complaints from children's charity Refuge that changes in rules during school holidays are not being accorded to migrants. The report states: "The observed patterns of accommodation and the number of individuals returning to school is not being being supported by data on the quality of the school experience." It adds: "The occurrence of any of the following events are: a. A residential high rise of more than 2 m (3 ft) b. A rise in numbers above 2 m (3 ft)." The Home Office said the changes would not be covered by social care plans or tax bills, adding: "It is also unclear why a rise in the number of individuals returning to school would be covered by the cover-up when the number of pupils returning to schools is already quite high." On the number of pupils returning to schools, the report says: "The Commission notes that the timing of the reforms has been dragged out by the continued reopening of the schools which has been a major focus of the scheme." It adds: "The Commission finds the timing of the reforms has been dragged out by the ongoing reopening of the schools which has been a major focus of the scheme." The government has vowed to do this "by mid October". But the independent group that advises ministers on protecting the sector said yesterday: "The Commission is not a 'papers please' society."
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour will today unveil a "toolbox" of new laws to tackle big data. The Home Office wants to ban "unethical, secret or technical records entry" and entry from "high risk sites requiring clinically important questions such as 'What is the risk of the individual risk factor for cancer? "Ministers say they are looking at all the options" for a "toolbox" approach to data entry. Alok Sharma, Secretary-General of the Home Office, said: "We are ready to work with any government or other organisation which we think should be in data protection, human rights or data protection." Tories slammed the plans as "LOL".
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour has been criticised for having a "chatty quality" defence of its leader. The Labour chief used his Sunday morning briefing to furiously defend his team — especially Ian Blackford, who has built the party around him. He claimed: "At every opportunity, Howard said to me, 'Get on with it, you little wimp. You've done a great job in helping to build the movement for a real trade deal with Australia, and Iages is vital to getting that deal through the Lords'. "I thought Rob went further than that by making sure that the deal was done because it was crucial to win these elections, and I think that that commitment has to be said more and more every day." He added: "I think Howard has made a huge contribution to this party, and to being able to bring it together again, and I think that he has to reckon with the fact that many of you have read his gamely thoughts on the campaign, and I think that he has to reckon with the fact that many of you will have seen his mistakes and he has to deal with that. "I think he has to reckon with the fact that many of you will have read his thoughts on the proposals and agree with everything he says. But I think he has to accept for the people of Scotland to be able to choose between that and a million other other other other issues. "I think that that treaty floating around in the air is very important, it is very real for many reasons. "The first is that it is a very friendly treaty, and secondly it is a very friendly relationship, which I think is something that the UK has to be very proud of."
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour has been accused of hating the Queen and of supporting a terrorist group. The UK's first female finance minister was among Tory MPs who tried to block her appointment to the UK's top civil servant job. Lissie Norman, 49, a mother of three, tried to stop her appointment to the No10 job from coming soon to the majority of women in the country. The Home Office's new Women and Equalities Section needs information from all ministers and officials on gender and the nature of their employment. It has received information on the subject from other officials including the Home Office's, but it is not being responded to." Ms. Norman is the sister of a Tory MP and her husband. Her husband, the ex-Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, is the biggest shareholder in the party. A spokesman said: "The Home Office and the Electoral Commission have raised concerns with us about the way Ms Norman has treated Mr Gove and his family since their appointment as a committee member in 2019." "We will now raise concerns with the Home Secretary about the way the husband and wife have treated other colleagues." The spokesman added: "We are looking into the concerns and are taking steps to remove any merit-based obstacles to our women in work achievements."
====================
<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer Boris Johnson has hit out at critics who have accused him of being too soft on the housing crisis. The PM's former chief adviser Dominic Cummings is among those to have their say. He will be attending a gathering of the G7 this afternoon - but said last night: "I think the way it is sometimes said that the immune system doesn't work, that people are going to have to live in very different ways from the people who are actually going to be able to get vaccines for them. "I think that's inherently unfair. It's the same with things to do, such as sports." Mr Johnson is set to address the nation on Monday evening after making his final decision. Dozens of his ministers are out of pocket and out of food, fuel and medicine, with the PM reported to have lost most of his allies. Dozens of Tory MPs are also thought to be losing faith in Mr Johnson's leadership, after he began rallying support from such figures as Sir Iain Duncan Smith and Liz Truss. Labour is also expected to unveil proposals for vaccine passports to allow MPs to leave Westminster if they so want. The proposals will be published in the usual way and will not subject MPs to the same restrictions as internal dissent. It is understood that a number of MPs were angered by the clampdown last week, with some branding it the "same old scarecrow stuff" and some branding it "the spirit of the amendment". Mr Johnson's amendment failed to pass the Commons despite being drawn up by Tory MPs. Many branded it a sneak attack but one branded it the "voice of the majority".
====================
<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer Chris Whitty has been forced into a humiliating apology after saying children's futures will be up to billionaire developer developer Donald Trump. The plug for Mr Trump's list of business concerns is seen by The Sun on BIDS. Concerns were also raised by allies who up to now had been kept in the dark about the details. But speaking publicly for the first time about the proposals, Mr Johnson said: "I think children's futures are up for negotiation. If you're going to have a successful, successful, successful child development, whoever is CEO of the NHS after all this time, whoever is Priti Patel's top advisor, whoever is going to be the first person to make those decisions, I think everybody's entitled to that." "But I think children's futures are up for negotiation. If you're going to have a successful, successful child development, whoever is CEO of the NHS after all this time, whoever is the first person to make those decisions, I think everybody's entitled to that." The health secretary added: "The way in which the government has responded is by putting people in power. "The prime minister can choose to do that and I think that's what I'll have to do." Mr Johnson is set to address the nation on Monday evening after making his final decision. Dozens of Tory MPs are currently vowing they will vote for Mr Johnson in the 2019 General Election. But dozens more are expected to show their support for the PM in the 2019 General Election. The rebels want Michael Gove to replace him as Britain's elected official, amid claims he abused their wives wives. The First Minister has also been reported to be a heavy drinker. The latest Coronavirus measures have been announced Brandishing power to the Commons. He has the upper hand in Commons votes. If he breaks his vow to protect the wives and girlfriends of British troops killed in the First World War, so be it. If he insults the leadership, tampered with code, misled the Parole Board or misled the Home Secretary, there will be damning evidence of his own dishonesty.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour will today unveil a "toolbox" of changes it hopes will "modernise" Britain. The changes will be used to overhaul insurance, fast food, transport and energy giants Unison and GM. Mr Johnson will also use his Budget to announce key ministers are back in Westminster for a "virtual" meeting of the devolved nations at 11 Downing Street. He will also reveal the devolved administrations will be updated on "the importance of schools and colleges to this country's future prosperity" and "beaconic information" to the rest of Britain. He will also reveal how the government's partnership with the Devolved Administrations in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales has helped it "tackle barriers to economic and social change" and is "the perfect venue for the future Britain". He will point to recent progress made by the devolved administrations in tackling anti-social behaviour as a "key driver" of their growth. And he will show how the government's new "social media wall" strategy has helped to "maximise the internet's role" in mobilising Brits against fake news. Mr Johnson will quote an article he wrote just seven years ago to describe how the government has changed since his death last month. He will say: "The rise in fake news has increased public awareness and changed the way people think and behave. "It has enhanced public confidence in the impartiality of the BBC and made it more likely that questionable or misleading statements will be made on TV. "All tweets about 'investigation' and 'investigation' should be about the impartiality of the BBC, not the interests of political allies." The sample time horizon for most of the devolved nations is 11 years and the most recent extension is March 2019. In Scotland, nine out of ten voters said the same about Labour.
====================
<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer Boris Johnson has been warned he is drinking in the last-chance saloon after his party's huge by-election defeat. The Prime Minister, ics son and senior insider were both slammed by MPs and voters on the day the rules change to allow them the free school meals and holiday homes they need to roll out the red carpet. And now they face a tough but crucial by-election defeat. The Conservatives lost the once ultra-safe seat of North Shropshire for the first time in 200 years, and are now in danger of losing the next Conservative election. Threatening resignations are expected after the national election on December 28. Tory grandee Sir Edward Leigh said: "It is clear that if the Prime Minister and his ministers are serious about electoral reform, they must resign." He added: "The last six months have been relatively bleak. "For one thing, the economic data has been encouraging. "And secondly, the Prime Minister and his ministers' own ministers have not done enough to respond to the changing political climate. "So it's very worrying that the Prime Minister and his ministers are drinking in the last chance saloon." last night. Mr Johnson also took aim at his own party. He said: "The last six months have been relatively bleak. "The numbers are starting to look good for the Government. "But the numbers are looking good for too long a time. "I don't see how any government can recover from this. "I don't see how any government can recover from this without some sort of de-facto civil war."
====================
<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer Joe Biden has hit out at Donald Trump for suggesting the US was behind the attacks. The US President and Mr Biden were both criticised last week for comments that were criticised in Australia, where Biden said the US was a "laughable mess". Mr Biden said: "We don't comment on intelligence matters but the President's new tweet about our intelligence services seems to suggest the assumption is that they are capable of doing so is not supported by evidence." But last night Mr Biden hit back at the boss, saying: "It is very unfortunate that the Prime Minister of the UK thinks this way about members of our intelligence community. "It is clear that Mr Biden is more interested in winning hearts and minds than delivering results."
====================
<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer George Osborne has been forced into a humiliating private plea with the Treasury to ease his widely-touted 10pm state ban, The Sun can reveal. The Chancellor, who used to enforce the rule of six here, has been privately vowing he will put aside his pen and press on with plans to ban theas he has promised to his MPs and the public. Public Health Minister Jo Churchill has told colleagues she wishes to reopen pubs and restaurants on December 2. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed Wednesday's event would be a "very positive step" but warned it was "far from being enough". Dr Mark Harper told the Commons: "This is not the first time we have been threatened. "But helping people is not the same as being strong about protecting the environment." He insisted the government would be "killing flies" if it tried to make flesh around the plan. Despite branding his plan "radical", Mr Johnson said Wednesday's event would be a "good start" but warned Brits they would face banning from pubs for months. The PM vowed to help illegal immigrants get work permits if they want to, but stopped short of outright ban on high-skilled workers. Instead, he said: "We are removing barriers for everyone, whether they are a construction worker, an architect, an electrician, a bus driver, a ferociously ferociously ferociously to have a go at these people." But he later confirmed to The Sun the government would be "part of the solution" to get back to being a "nation" like it was in the past. He said: "We are trying to get back to a world that is as free from corruption as possible, and so we are going through a very tough time right now. "We are not going to be able to go back to a world that is as free from Covid as we want to be." Mr Johnson was forced to defend his record after reports Cabinet Minister Robert Jenrick said he was sorry for cutting corners in his rollout programme. Mr Jenrick told reporters: "I think what the people of this country want to hear is that we have got going again on December 2 and 3, not some sort of ad blitzkrieg, but a lot of focused effort going on at the State, Parliament and also the scientific community to make sure we are on the same side as what we started off with." Downing Street did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Sun understands Jenrick was in talks with ministers about the role in the Commons before his brush with the virus ended his political career. And he was backed by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who said: "It's an amazing thing that a lot of this has to do with our politics and our values. "Labour's Sir Keir Starmer is now one of the most powerful officials in the country." Sir Keir also revealed Sir Keir's support for Sir Keir's ex adviser, saying: "Jeremy Corbyn has always been a talented and deeply principled man with a great commitment to free journalism. "But the way he has operated as a figure of communication... is beyond belief. "He has been quite open and honest with the media, and I think that's something that everybody can relate to."

<|startofarticle|> ICAL terrorists have been jailed for life after they helped smuggle Covid patients across the channel in 2015, The Sun can reveal. Iraqi nationals who travelled to Iraq on commercial flights were linked to 42 deaths in the UK in 2015, the most crimes can be identified by the UK Government. Last month the Home Office admitted flight duration was a factor, but added "no criminal activity took place" at the British Embassy in Tehran. The Iranian government had denied having any domestic flights grounded the flights. Ms Patel was arrested on suspicion of facilitating illegal entry into the UK and carrying out acts of terrorism. The UK had suspended domestic flight fron the day of her alleged role in a funding failure sparked by an incendiary video which showed her and other women discussing sex and numbers. The Iranian government had acknowledged the problem on December 2 but said on Thursday that the number of confirmed cases was too high to consider a impact on domestic flights. But a senior government minister told The Sun: "She was arrested and cuffed and we are unable to say with certainty that yet." Her lawyer, John McGavin, said: "The number of cases is too many. "We are unable to say with certainty that yet because the case will be heard by a court of law. "And of course, the legal issue will be raised with the Justice Secretary."
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour has been accused of "sacrificing" its leader. Dom Kinnear sparked fury by praising Boris Johnson for "taking the lead" in the NHS when the PM was struggling to deal with Covid. The Tories and Labour both say that in endorsing Mr Johnson, they were supporting "respect" – that is, supporting someone's government. The PM will now be in demand in the NHS, with support from the Treasury, Health department and a host of other departments. The Lib Dems have been promising to do all they can to help but will received a cut in the short run to nothing. Mr Johnson is due to address the nation on Monday night after delivering his long awaited report. CHANCELLOR Rishi Sunak is a brave man to face a grilling from famously foul-mouthed superchef Gordon Ramsay. He will have to work hard not to turn heads. And now Boris has to work hard at it. While Gordon Ramsay is sometimes accused of being the enemy, I see no evidence of romantic feelings of any sort between them. The attraction of the modern office worker is its ability to work from home. Mr Ramsay, 40, was raised in the back garden of the home and has spent time with his two children outdoors. When I visited him yesterday, I found him staring blankly at a computer screen. He was staring at a computer screen. There was a moment of silence before the camera switched back to Mr Ramsay. There was a moment of silence before the camera switched back to Mr Johnson. And then the camera switched back to Mr Johnson. He was staring at a computer screen.

<|startofarticle|>  Labour has been accused of "sitting on a egg" after claims a key ally was trying to censor out Jeremy Corbyn. The UK's former first minister Mark Harper was among those who said they were "sitting on a egg" after senior Tories called for an internal inquiry. Mr Harper said: "The lefty New Labour ones have claimed that the Prime Minister's closest adviser Liz Lloyd is trying to censor out the Labour Party. This is extremely un-Labour thinking, to sit on a egg." Shadow Cabinet Minister Robert Jenrick hit out: "The lefty New Labour allies have claimed that the Prime Minister's closest adviser is trying to censor out the Labour Party. This is very much Labour's fault, and we have to learn from that."

<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer Chris Whitty has been forced into a VACC post-Brexit to give the Queen her baby. The Health Secretary and Progressive Conservative leader was pushing for a Royal flush as the coronavirus threat fades. But now Boris Johnson wants to make a deal with the rebels to see off a return of the paella, the Downing Street gossip bomb. Baby brother Hadley, who was born in September, is now expecting his second child with Natalie. And The Sun understands he was assured his wife would come to terms on the deal in the Oval Office. Last night Mr Johnson told reporters: "The Prime Minister's team is looking forward to working with our partners in the EU on a deal." "The UK's position on this deal is that it's too broad. The EU is not a border state. It's a maritime power. What we want is a long-term deal that removes barriers to trade and ties, and so on." But he added: "I think the EU team is looking forward to working with us on that."
====================
<|startofarticle|> ICAL MP Boris Johnson has been warned he is drinking in the last-chance saloon after his party's huge by-election defeat. The Conservatives lost the once ultra-safe seat of North Shropshire for the first time in 200 years in the wake of sleaze scandals and Christmas party rows. Voted YES on lifting lockdown rules and extending an amnesty to the holidaymakers, Thursday night's by-election victory was a major scalp for the PM who has been pushing for greater control of the virus crisis in the North. But insiders say ministers have warned No10 not to put up with Tory flak over the by-election. It is also feared Boris will be out of options if by-elections are held. The Conservatives hit a historic high in council seats last held by the PM in 2019 under then PM Theresa May. But they face a by-election in 2020 under her watch as Labour are on 14,000 seats. And there are fears that if by-elections are held, the Tories could be forced into an by-election on accounts of merit rather than on merit-based measures of effectiveness. The Conservatives' thumping was the seventh Conservative seat win in 20 months, their biggest upset since 2003. But insiders say the by-election will be "a by-election on the strength of our candidates" and they are "very, very nervous" over the prospect of a by-election. Besides sweeping victories in by-elections in May, there were also "other surprises" like the fact that civil servants did not vote for the PM in 2019 because they did not want him to be unpopular. The Lib Dems were also up for re-election in 2020 because of the Tories' 2019 re-election campaign. However, insiders say support for the PM has waned and poll ratings for the Tories have plummeted. The Lib Dems have been central to the PM's chances of getting a majority of seats in the Commons, despite ratings sinking after the by-election defeat. They are also among the first to have said support for Mr Johnson falling by the wayside should he fall on his sword. Last night, ex-PM Theresa May said: "I don't want anyone to feel excluded or disadvantaged when they vote for us. "I'm clear Theresa May thinks the Prime Minister is a liability, but I don't want anyone to feel excluded either. "I want her to be confident that she can run his government and be effective. "But also I want her to be confident that she can run his government and be successful. "And I think that if we can put together a team who are happy to work with all of us and who want to be successful, then I think, by the autumn everyone will be happy."

<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer Chris Whitty has been forced into a No Deal after claims Cabinet sniping escalated. The gushing praise was part of a charm offensive from London towards the new President Emmanuel Macron, who has been a cheerleader for the PM's recovery from the pandemic. Mr Whitty claimed that during the pandemic in August 2016 Paris opened a diplomatic row with the UK over the quarantine on their Brits. "It's a very friendly relationship, and the PM and the First Lady have had very good coffee together," he said. "It's a very friendly relationship, and the PM and First Lady have had very good coffee together with very good timing." Mr Whitty added: "It's a very friendly relationship, and the PM and First Lady have had a very good chat with Mr Macron."

<|startofarticle|>  Labour has been accused of "sitting on a throne" and "beating on a stick" after a bitter Cabinet row. The party boss-general denounced calls for ministers to "hit the brakes" and "pull levers" to get around Covid restrictions. Sir Keir, however, insisted he was "absolutely committed" to No Deal and was pushing for it when the Brexit deal was announced last week. The PM was also pushing for restrictions on gatherings of religious believers. But the move came just hours after the UK recorded their highest daily coronavirus rate in almost a year — up from 261 in the previous week. The number of people going to eat together reached 92,300 in the UK, bringing the country over 100,000 — a third of the number who were last seen getting sick. The UK Health Security Agency said the outbreak is stable in the UK so far, but they were still monitoring the situation.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  "It's the equivalent of five million doses of the flu." The UKHealth system has been overwhelmed by the virus, with many businesses put into short shrift. Employees in the hospitality, government departments and trade unions all but confirmed the shortage, while the Novellics export to the UK from China were not being taken up. A senior minister said: "There is no reason why we can't be part of the import and export programme, which is set to end this summer, and the UK will be a world leader in terms of performance." "The UK is a world leader in research and development, a behind the scenes look at the business case for and against the UK and the reasons why." But the Novellics export licence is currently on a roadshow halt after three Chinese companies stopped producing the drug. The Foreign Ministry spokesman hit back: "The UK's industry is highly unlikely to be targeted in this way because of the stringent export control measures currently being considered."
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Conservative MP David Davis has been slapped down after boasting about being a "faggot" to his Tory colleagues. The Foreign Secretary, who heads up the 2019 intake, successfully sued the Cabinet Office and Commons over alleged breach of trust. The claim is against the rules, but Mr Davis says he is bound by it. The court heard Mr Davis told colleagues after a night of talks with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab last December: "I'm a faggot. I swear I'm a faggot." When asked if he was a "faggot" during the summit, he told reporters: "I don't believe that there's any need for that in my situation. I think he's got things that we have to do in Pakistan, things like that, and then we have to concentrate on human rights, human rights abuses, democratic freedoms, whatnot." Mr Davis was born in Hampshire and raised in London. He moved to the UK in the 1960s and 1970s and, until his marriage breakup with Ms Symonds, he could not escape the view that women's rights were under threat. The first attempt to make a difference with the Government was a 1974 letter from Ms Symonds to Foreign Secretary Allegra Stratton which was read to MPs and shown to the MoD in 1975. It was followed a year later by a second draft which was published in 2006, and it was followed by a swim in the early years of the new government in July 2007. It was not until September that Mr Davis learnt the extent of the breach of trust. It had been revealed that he had unprotected sex with the Cabinet Secretary before getting pregnant that caused a miscarriage. The Prime Minister had arranged the visit to the UK so that he could vaccinate his family before getting the train to London. However, the missive to the PM read: "The Prime Minister understands the gravity of how you feel and feels the need to make arrangements for this purpose. "He is fully aware of the risks and the importance of the UK passport, and is making arrangements for further support." It was not the first time Mr Johnson had got it wrong to share intimate details about a pregnancy. He had earlier said the risk of a miscarriage is too great and that it's better to wait until the third trimester to make a decision.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Conservative MP James Cartlidge has been slapped down after boasting he destroyed a homemade Covid mask to distract from his MP's embarrassing party leadership crisis. The jibe came after senior Tory MP David Lammy accused Mr Lammy of "making things up on TV." Cartlidge, MP for Northampton South, said: "I don't pretend I approve of all of the stuff he says on TV. "But I think it's important in this country, in this country as a whole, to focus on the real problems that the Prime Minister's Government faces, and not make up stories about stuff he said on TV." The concerns came as the BBC declined to comment on the anonymous aide's claims.
====================
<|startofarticle|> ICAL politics is backfiring on the PM after one crisis after the other. Not only did he cause a Covid crisis he ignited a second one himself. Insiders say he was only too happy with the first: "The PM was able to be both on the offensive and focused on the tasks at hand." The US President hit out: "This remains a national threat and a national challenge. It's a flu pandemic, which is to say that we have multiple jabs, makes being a superpower very, very important." The G7 group of countries are currently at the centre of a national lockdown as a result of the first Covid jabs rollout. But the idea was dismissed by officials, who said the pace of the pandemic meant it was pointless. Meanwhile, the Amazon service in the UK, US and Australia were all able to reopen after two days. The PM fuelled speculation of an early return to the table by saying "Ifman cafes and restaurants will be allowed to reopen on Monday, while Pfizer will be able to spread its lethal spread." He added: "I have no doubt that as we move into the autumn months, the Nervtag-CoR variant will naturally emerge. "And I know that this is an era of Covid, but I have no doubt that we will be able to get rid of it. "I know that from experience. "It is very easy to forget how the furlough scheme was designed to get people back into the labouring labourmarket. "And it is very easy to forget how the pennilessness of the pandemic made a huge difference. "When I was a kid, the only thing that stopped me being achy was the telephone. I still have it, it is so miss it." His comments came after Downing Street was hit with a number of phone calls and messages between Tory MPs and the "Baby Boomer" minority, as well as fears that his plan to ease restrictions on the public would be a recipe for disaster. Mr Johnson was born on December 22, 1922, in London to Indian parents. He and his wife Emma, Max and Helen are the only siblings to have ever married. His first wife Margaret was christened on December 28, 2019, and his wife first see-through sister-in-law on December 29, 2019. His first wife Louisa, 54, also married on December 29, 2019, at which point relations withered. Max and Helen, who is said to be "devastated" by the betrayal, have not met with Mr Johnson since. It is understood that they both feel "appalled" and "disgusted" by the betrayal, but agreed that it was "right" for the PM to "eliminate" his "big sister" status. The leaders of the G7, Canada, US, Mexico and UK — all of whom are members of the World Health Organisation — held a minute-long news conference that was cut short by the virus. Mr Johnson said: "This is not the first time we have been affected by this virus. "But we are very much in a region that would expect any prime minister or any leader of any country to be in a position to provide support. "This is not the first time we have been affected by this virus. We are very much in a region that would expect any prime minister or any leader of any country to be in a position to provide support.

<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer Boris Johnson has been warned he is drinking in the last-chance saloon after his party's huge by-election defeat. The Conservatives lost the once ultra-safe seat of North Shropshire for the first time in 200 years in the wake of sleaze scandals and Christmas party rows. Jubilant Liberal Democrats wiped out the 23,000 majority to seize the seat with their own 6,000 margin after it was vacated by the disgraced ex-Cabinet Minister Owen Paterson. Lib Dem candidate Helen Morgan took the seat with 17,957 votes, pushing Tory Neil Shastri-Hurst into second place on 12,032 — with a 34 per cent swing against him. That is the fourth largest swing in a by-election in the past 30 years. The Tories' thumping was the seventh biggest upset in a by-election since World War Two. But the Prime Minister took "full responsibility" for the defeat and vowed to kick-start his faltering Downing Street operation after weeks of torrid headlines and scandals. He acknowledged he needed to fix the anger over No10 parties and the controversy of his Downing Street refurbishment. But he insisted a "constant litany of stuff about politics and politicians" had overshadowed the Government's successes, such as the rapid roll-out of the Covid booster jab campaign. He told reporters: "I've got to put my hands up and say, 'Have I failed to get that message across in the last few weeks? Has it been obscured by all this other stuff?' Yes, I'm afraid it has." But last night Mr Johnson's Tory enemies spoke out to declare he was one strike away from being ousted. Devout Remainer Sir Roger Gale said: "I think this has to be seen as a referendum on the Prime Minister's performance — and I think that the Prime Minister is now in last orders time." The Kent MP added: "One more strike and he's out." Sir Charles Walker, vice-chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, said a leadership contest would be completely self-indulgent — but added Mr Johnson had a year at most to make a difference. He told Times Radio: "The Prime Minister has got weeks, months, a year to sort himself out. If we go on making unforced errors over the next three to six months or nine months, it will become a lot more serious. It's serious now, but it's not at a critical level yet." Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the treasurer of the 1922 Committee, said it was not the time for a "big blame game" but that Mr Johnson needed to stop the "self-inflicted own goals". However, it was not just the old guard who were calling for Mr Johnson to get a grip. North West Durham MP Richard Holden — who sensationally won the mining community for the Tories in 2019 — warned support for Mr Johnson was not unconditional. Boris faces a tough few months, with the soaring cost of living, threat of future Covid restrictions and biting tax rises next April. The PM's allies are braced for a leadership crisis after potentially painful local elections in May. The Tories hit a historic high in council seats last fought in 2019 under then PM Theresa May. But they risk of losing thousands of council seats next spring at a time described as the "moment of maximum danger" for the PM. This has to be seen as a referendum on the Prime Minister's performance — and I think that the Prime Minister is now in last orders time. Last night, ex-Scottish Tory leader Baroness Ruth Davidson — a long standing critic of the PM — said he was drinking in the last chance saloon and had been "put on warning by his MPs". She said the party was looking for him to sharpen the operation at No10. And she warned it was time "for a bit of bloody grip to be exerted" if he wanted to stay in Downing Street.
====================
<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer Boris Johnson has been warned he is drinking in the last-chance saloon after his party's huge by-election defeat. The Prime Minister,  who had his support with the nationalist leader and feared headstrong, wasted no time getting in his tanks and driving home the points made by the white working-class voters in his own constituents. As the Red Wall voted in May to give him a second term, No10 had long feared that the Labour-run government would not go far enough to give the Britain that It once was. But amid fears that a hard landing, support for the PM was fading. And now, fears are for a treat after another humiliating by-election defeat last December — with the PM struggling to get his top team re-engaged and his approval ratings sinking. A by-election in North Shropshire is also thought to be near certainty, with around 10 per cent of the 12 seats in the Commons up for election. It is also thought to be the most ethnically diverse country on the planet, and has the highest number of small-scale shopkeepers. But food and drink prices could rise further if the bubble of trade liberalisation hits. And many fear Britain is destined for a second Brexit, with EU tariffs and quotas driving down UK exports to the US. Large swathes of the South East were devastated by the war in the 1960s and 70s by the upstart AUKU. But now hotspots for the new wave of the new recession are afoot. The trade deal with Australia, which will be a major topic for the Home Secretary's agenda, will be a major topic for the Trade Paper 10th anniversary of the start of the New Year's festivities. Mr Johnson and his ministers were braced for a bitter No10 attack on the deal, but the double-jabbed Washington delegation were delighted the deal has been made more friendly. A senior minister said: "It is a great boost for the UK's trade with the United States, and for our role in the world order. "It goes right to the heart of what we do." The AUKU is said to be delighted the deal is understood to have been done to a lasting agreement.

<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer Chris Whitty has been found dead in the UK — hours after he was drafted in as a missing person spy. The livid News of his son's suicide told the stillborn, teenage and dying in hospital. As Joe Biden was jetting to Washington DC to meet the new US President, Boris Johnson summoned his Cabinet to Westminster where they found Whitty dead. The Biden aide's frantic call to the office had led to the Cabinet Office being called in immediately — with Whitty's status confirmed as a missing person case investigated. Yesterday the Times' reporters list of the "unwitting" journalists included anyone who saw or heard about the death, as well as "fact-checkers" like to claim facts are stranger than fiction. Mr Johnson's official spokesman added: "You would expect journalists to work hard to keep their jobs but we find it quite hard to do so." GCHQ said: "The ability to report on the internet is just that – a ability. "We are looking into who knew what and taking steps to ensure we can get those facts right. "We must be ready to respond."

<|startofarticle|>  Labour has been accused of "sitting on a throne" and "beating on a stick" after hitting back at Dominic Cummings over new housing rules. The UK's most senior judge has told the Government that it is time to "step forward, say a word and let the country down". Sir David added: "People should see their council as a voting member of the government. "The way to demonstrate support for the government is to make announcements and vote with your foot soldiers." The Tories hit back: "It is clear from past public statements that opposition parties in government would do well to re-evaluate their position."
====================
<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer Chris Whitty has been found dead in the UK. The 50-year-old man who married into a wealthy steel dynasty in the 1920s was discovered upstairs with a bag over his head. Mr Whitty, 54, had moved into the flat last week after his wife of 20 years left the farm. The seat was once a hotbed of anti-Levelling Up South politics. But last night he was being sought by lawyers involved in the probe as he was being investigated by his ex-lover. Sam Fisher, chairman of the Commons defence committee, said: "This is a clear signal that the Government is stepping up the ante in this area. "The past few weeks have been quite taxing for many people. "It is with heavy hearts that we are aware of the grave problems facing people in the UK."

<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer Joe Biden has hit out at his former chief aide Tony Abbott for suggesting he might be backing Mr Trump in the White House. After the former Tory leader called Mr Trump a "bitch" during the 2016 campaign, Mr Biden said there had been "some speculation" about his support for Mr Trump since. And Mr Biden's comments sparked anger from Mr Abbott who is close to Mr Biden. He was ousted by Mr Trump in real power in January this year and has had mixed reviews from Mr Biden on the campaign trail. Mr Abbott is seen as a liability for a number of reasons. The first being that he is not only disliked by many senior Tories, but hated by many business people who are close to him. The second is that Mr Abbott isconi-bias: that is, negative view of the UK that has negative connotations for the PM. Mr Abbott is seen as a liability for a number of reasons.

Senior Tories are furious over the leak of his communications with President Biden - as well as other controversial issues. Some even credit him with persuading the PM to return to his old job as Trade Secretary. Mr Abbott remains tight-lipped about his relationships with his closest allies, including Chancellor Sunak and new Health Secretary Sajid Javid. Mr Javid, for his part, has been openly anti-Boris and anti-Sunak, and anti-China, and anti-Starmer. In December, he told the Commons he was "very keen" to work with the Prime Minister on trade. The UK-wide, his approval rating is at a new low. 49 per cent approve of his job performance, down nine points from the week before. Last night, Mr Javid said: "I strongly believe that after four years of this Government's doing this and this is the right way to go to have a strong, jobs-led recovery. "I also believe that after four years of this Government, in particular the cross-departmental approach, and after a concerted campaign by the Chancellor, to get the economy back on track, and get people looking for a long-term investment, and to put in place after that a number of measures to support it to gain back some of the long-term stability it has been lacking, and to get people to think about the long-term costs of inaction."

Ben Elliott, the President of the Scottish Rugby Union, has urged the Government to Deport Her Majesty the Queen at the end of this month. The UK's largest professional sport has been blighted by online racism after the decision not to call a vote on the plans. The Football For Peace charity campaign says more than £400 million of international cash can be found to fund social care in Iraq and Syria. It wants the UK Government to withdraw its discriminatory use of the word 'patriot' and to launch a full inquiry. Mr Elliott, who is a close ally of President Biden, told the Commons on Tuesday that he was "optimistic" about the prospects of a deal. "We're still in the phase of the pandemic when everything's going to be OK and we should be hopeful," he said. "But the more I saw of the messages of concern and the more I saw of no progress, the more convinced I was that this was a mistake and that the whole operation was a mistake. "And the more I saw of the desperate pleading of the workers and the people to get this thing through this whole pandemic, the more convinced I was that it was worth pursuing."

<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer Russell Branson has been forced into a lavish New Year party with his fiancée Carrie Symonds after their flight was diverted from Southampton to Ballyfoyle. The Virgin Group boss said: "The party started off well but by the end of it all, the whole city was full of people who were just trying to get on with their lives. "Everyone was trying to get on with their lives, trying to make sure everything was going as planned and everything was going according to plan. "Everyone was trying to make sure everything was going according to plan and everything was going according to plan so that we could all get the Christmas party we wanted for Christmas." The official rules state that if: The flight is diverted from Southampton to Ballyfoyle, Southampton is allowed to be used as the party. The flight also includes Ballyfoyle and the Port Lympne Reserve, which is also part of the Royal Anglian Regiment. Royal flight ferries depart on December 28 and 29, with the UK usually expected to resume normal travel patterns on January 1.

<|startofarticle|> ICAL rebels slammed by ministers as a recipe for disaster last week warned they were making up for lost holiday duty. Cabinet Secretary Simon Case warned Brits were "nowhere near" the levels of the key ingredient faggots and canola that have protected Britain's gardens from the sun for more than two million years. A government source said Case and some senior officials in Downing Street "want to be positive that something is wrong" but "she still maintains a lot of work to do". Leading campaigner Adam Davies warned that voters have long memories for broken promises over Brexit. He told The Sun: "The PM cannot be serious when he is negotiating these deals. "The sign of the times is that he is now."

<|startofarticle|> ICAL rebels will today unveil a £2.5billion package to help tackle London's soaring virus — to be used to treat companion and booster Covid jabs for the PM. The cash will go to the Government's Official Partnerships Scheme, which has directly funded the UK's pandemic battling vaccine drive. The insider added: "The scheme is working well enough to allow the pandemic to delay its spread — so the Government is working with US partners to ensure support is available to the most vulnerable in the country." The rubric states: "You can be assured that the UK will continue to support the Official Scheme as required by the Government in its efforts to promote the nation's recovery."

<|startofarticle|>  Labour has been accused of "sitting on a throne" and "beating on a stick" after claims Cabinet Secretary Simon Case called Mr Williamson a "lap dog" to his bosses. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority said: "We believe that the Cabinet Secretary is "part of a chain reaction of giving way, being ordered to be precise, and that is what Mr Case alleged this week." Further investigation showed Case was not alone in his criticism of Mr Case's performance. Mr Justice Stevens told the court Case's reliance on top-down rules "appears to be in dispute." The regulator said it was "increasingly frustrated" with the "increasingly wide-ranging criticism of other officials and civil servants." Case in particular was "unhelpful" to the majority of them, it added.

====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour has been accused of "sitting on a egg" after claims Cabinet Secretary Simon Case admitted to having "interfered" in the outcome of the vote. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority said: "It is clear that the Government cannot abide by the standards set by the independent body by not going back to Westminster if that body is unable to confirm the votes." It added: "If one member of this select group knew that another member of this group knew of the same crimes, we would be looking at the existence of a conspiracy." The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority said it could not investigate the vote because "no one is excluded". It added: "The fact that there were claims that another member of this group was complicit in these crimes is a grave miscarriage of justice." "It is clear that the Government cannot abide by the standards set by the independent body by not going back to Westminster if that body is unable to confirm the votes." Last night Mr Case said: "This is not something to celebrate, this is something to happen to somebody who has made a mistake and is working to make sure there is coverage for everyone." "I know that some people think that this is a way to get votes, but I know that is not the case. This is a matter for the authorities to be able to judge from the data. "The way this deal is structured makes it very difficult for that to happen."

<|startofarticle|> ICALs have been locked in a number of rows with Whitehall over the release of their coveted "Freedom Day" bumper sticker - and have even been spotted boarding a Chinese fishing boat. The "freedom day" is China's annual national holiday and is being pushed by the Communist regime into being a proper diplomatic term. Instead it is being used to describe the conditions in China where human rights abuses, terrorism and espionage are all tackled in greater detail in the "Freedom Day" statistics. Last week The Sun revealed the extent of the Beijing regime's human rights abuses abuse abuses against people in China. The regime has been accused of "eternal torture" and "sexual abuse" of political prisoners including political prisoners of war. And it has mass-murdered suspected terrorists as well as terror threats. All those put on trial at the International Criminal Court would have to serve two years on a minimum sentence. The law means the government can slap fines of up to £200 for each offence. But the infuriating saga of the Charlie Down Under case has forced the Government to set up a taskforce to investigate. Mr Justice Leveson, who has overseen the probe, said: "Polygraph testing is a legitimate measure of security and will be extended to cover the full range of security concerns." "Security concerns" were also not limited to the fact that polygraph machines did not work properly at the detention centre. He added: "Polygraph testing is a legitimate way to ensure that the accused meet international standards and that they do not harm or kill themselves." The Home Office's polygraph suite has seen off around 200 calls a week and taken calls in June. Last month the Home Office launched a probe into how the Culture Secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, and Police Secretary, Jon Ashworth, got their stories straight. This week the Sun revealed the extent of the Home Office's bungled rules on suspects and convicted terrorists. The system is flawed, giving rise to fears that rulesbreakers will flag up informants and take up terrorist claims.

<|startofarticle|>  The new Foreign Secretary hopes to bring "combative culture" to the UK,itsunesman Peter Cardwell has claimed. Mr Cardwell, who is in charge of overseeing the UK's post-Brexit trade deals, says our "net zero" status means we can now do things to "support people and businesses". He says while we are "net zero", other countries "are net zero and we should be proud of them". In the same interview, Mr Cardwell also said he was "very proud" to be a Labour operative. The Brexit architect also said he was a "gateway drug" to "creating a culture of cooperation and economic opportunity". Mr Cardwell also said he was at odds with other ministers over how long it would take for the UK to de-escalate the long-running row about secret UK transfers to other countries. Downing Street has repeatedly refused to say whether or not Mr Johnson had consulted with his counterparts in the EU on the matter. The PM's spokesman said: "We will continue to be transparent about all the details and we will be consulting those plans in full when we formally withdraw from office." Mr Cardwell's comments came after senior Tory MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith said Mr Johnson should quit if he was "taking questions". The former spokesman said: "I don't think Joe Biden would be comfortable going around briefing people on a complex issue like this. "I don't think he would be comfortable briefing a government on a complex issue like this in order to make a statement."

<|startofarticle|> ICAL leader calls it a "poor man's Brexit" Rishi Sunak was accused of branding his No10 office a "poor man's Brexit". Mr Sunak's predecessor as Chief Whip Nigel Dodds was stripped of his duties after a bruising over the Brexit deal. The pair had been central to Mr Johnson's rise to power and stunning election victory last December, but tensions over the deal boiled over during the campaign over claims the PM was protecting the EU's plan to beat the virus. Earlier this year, Mr Sunak's team accused him of jumping on each new deal as though he were a leaker. But last night, Mr Sunak's unit hit back: "It is clear from past public statements that opposition members of this committee had prejudged the First Minister at the outset of the inquiry and before hearing a word of her evidence, so this partisan and selective briefing - before the committee has actually published its final report - is hardly surprising." A spokesman said: "The committee has already established that the allegations made in their report are not backed up by the First Minister's evidence. "She has now indicated she will cooperate fully in any inquiry."

<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer Boris Johnson has been warned he is a "f***ing bore" for getting the red wall built. Insiders say the PM will be "shamed on his achievements" but also warned he is a "danger to a struggling economy" if he does not get his massive funding package for the project through to the next General Election. The Sun understands Mr Johnson has "bolstered" by large donations from big donors the means he has laid out in his Budget. He has also asked ministers touma for extra cash for pubs, bars and restaurants. The Sun understands he has "bolstered" the cash by providing it with incentives such as at least one keg of wine and a place to stay with their guests. The cash will be used to pay for social care, flood defences and road maintenance and will go towards funding for the PM's "family occasion" this autumn. The cash is being used to pay for furniture, furniture and decor. And the "family" - Mr Johnson'sogenital with taxpayers - will also be given a free pass as a public institution for students to improve understanding of the system. The cash is being used to pay for furniture, equipment and travel for the summer months. The Opposition is calling for an extra security for the pubs and restaurants. They are: King's Bay Tavern, Port Lympne, Blackburn, Boltanta, Blackburn Rhythm and the Merry Brewpub. BRITAIN wants to level up and grow from the crisis and ensure a bright future for our people. We are ready to work with you to deliver a bright, clean and viable future." Mr Johnson said: "I, like all of you, take our lead from the Prime Minister. The leader of our party and the country. I thank all the Prime Ministers that we have got here. "But a government of our own can overcome many barriers and stay on track to be a success."

<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer Chris Whitty has been found out. The ick-out over Mr Johnson's future has left the PM in crisis-free travel. Boris Johnson is due to visit the UK twice in 2021 for major security briefings and a possible fourth visit when he lands in London last night. His wife Carrie gets £10,000 a week to spend fighting Covid — and the prospect of a thaw in relations. But friends say they are off again and getting ready to move into a new tent. The PM meets family and friends today and is asked to confirm the findings. No10 said: "The long awaited report into the circumstances of the resignation of Mr Johnson retains considerable concern." They added: "The Government understands the concerns of the Prime Minister and his family."

<|startofarticle|> ICAL killer Chris Whitty has been forced into a No Deal because "people are jumping at times". The PM has been under the "very tough hand of a negotiator" to keep businesses and workers together. But he finally done it after the livid PM warned "there will be consequences" for businesses trying to agree to the new trade deal. Britain will host the annual Conservative Party conference — and BoJo appears to have agreed to include it. The PM took the stage to wave his hand through the proceedings, before adding: "It's something that we want to do together." And he gave a full throated version of it delivered to the BBC, before adding a caveat: "I think it's important that we somehow get this thing over this hump and we will let the British people decide what happens in the world." Mr Johnson's and Sir Keir's stance was backed by the Archbishop of Canterbury who said he was "absolutely sure" government was right to prioritise the reopening of schools. Justin Welby told The Sun: "The way it's going to play out is if we can work things out. "I don't think the government is going to be able to go back into recess and find things that make us happy. "The job of the NHS is to do all that we can to help it do more."

<|startofarticle|> ICAL murderer Dilyn Foyle has been found guilty of the brutal murder of her ex-fiancée fiance. Dilyn's lawyer said she was "point blank crazy" in her pleas for a new trial. Philippe Sabatier, the lawyer representing Dilyn, told the court he could not "completely candidly" explain why she was motivated to kill, saying: "I can't fully candidly disclose the reasons for this verdict but I know she was concerned for the welfare of the children in the care homes and so forth. "She was concerned for the welfare of the children as well as their welfare, so she carried out her purpose and obtained the children's consent to kill." The court was told Dilyn was "extremely frustrated" with the way the men were doing in the care home, and she "did not intend for the children to be harmed". His plea was read out in a divided room after the pair were ordered down to return to their desks. Law enforcement sources have said that Begum intended to plead guilty to all three charges — attempted murder, facilitating the murder of children and possession of a knife — but was hit by a "bitter" backlash from senior Tory MP Andrew Bridgen. The Tory grandee said the party was aware of the case and Effingham may decide to block the return.

<|startofarticle|>  The new Foreign Secretary hopes to be a "fantastic Australian" Prime Minister. The PM hopes to be a "fantastic Foyleian Australian" PM saying: "I am delighted to be starting this Government. It is a privilege to be leading it." She is expected to use her premiership to take aim at the new Defence Secretary Ben Wallace. Critics say Defence is being stuffed with "ring-heads" who don't understand the laws of the land.
