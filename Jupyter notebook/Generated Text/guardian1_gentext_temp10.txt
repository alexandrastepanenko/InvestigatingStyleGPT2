<|startofarticle|>  Last week's budget included a stealth cut to funding for youth services worth more than £400m over the next three years, Labour has claimed. The shadow schools minister, Vicky Foxcroft, said: "Cuts are necessary to support school run-downs and the recovery from the pandemic. "Young people are still getting thrown into the biggest surge in school-age dependency in more than a decade, and there is pressure from across the political spectrum to trim the curriculum. The right thing is for the government to act now, and to accept the budget and act on it today." In his budget speech last Wednesday, the chancellor said he would create "poverty pay" that would cover the rising costs of farming and other sectors. Pledging to make sure "we don't have to switch economies", the chancellor said: "When we bring jobs back, we'll have enough money to feed the economy and save the families who have worked so hard over the pandemic. We can't have enough of working, and we can't have enough of saving people's time." Removing the antisubordinate system of redundancies was a deliberate political decision, as the Labour leader was acutely aware until Starmer moved to different days. 1963: Labour members' strike for the first time More than a decade later, the phrase "new society" revealed itself as the dividing line between the disparate sides of the Conservative vote. As well as being widely used by George Osborne to describe what was then the Conservative party, the new antisocial personality rules only applied to Osborne-era policies. That meant tackling the problem of antisocial behaviour – bad faith – was not on the agenda. Meanwhile, the economy was still recovering from the Covid pandemic, and the sanction for breaking the rules under the Communities and Social Security Act of 2010 was being rolled out to schools across the country. Despite the new face of the Conservative party, the antisocial personality, Paul Stephenson, the shadow cabinet office minister, was the latest former Conservative leader to question the party's approach to tackling the problem of antisocial behaviour. Michael Gove was notably absent from the PLP's conference last Wednesday because, as Johnson said at the time, "we have a new motion coming down on Thursday that will be a motion machine for antisocial behaviour." However, fellow Labour MPs Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn have been campaigning for him to be considered as a potential prime minister, to help those in need, to argue against Keir Starmer's radical immigration agenda.  As well as Galloway, Starmer announced he would create a committee to discuss the country's concerns before the winter months come to an end. Labour has so far declined to rule out an attempt to move Galloway into number two on the short list of potential ministers, after the former prime minister Paterson resigned over sexual harassment allegations. Alex Allan, the Labour MP for Streatham, who has supported Curtice's candidacy, tweeted on Friday morning: "If Stephen Amess is saved from death by being attracted to by a stallion, I would be willing to wing it." He also repeated his insistence that the government does not "pull the rug out" from under fallen ministers – though he did not specify what that might include. The silence from Starmer's office has alarmed some in his own party who believe the prime minister must deal with the issue of sexual harassment more intently. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow cabinet Office minister, tweeted on Saturday morning: "Keir has not pulled the rug out from under Keir Clarke-Symonds yet. He is sticking with him because he knows what he stands for." Some ministers, including the chancellor, are also baffled by the scale of the breach of trust issue. The original intention of the agreement was to allow a select group of public figures to disclose personal financial information, but the government changed the rules to ensure such disclosures would not trigger a response from the Electoral Commission. David Cameron's predecessor, Theresa May, struck a deal with the data mining company Deepas that allowed it to automatically generate figures for parliamentarians and other influential figures, much of them parliament employees. Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May, has neverbeforehad a session with a corporation that manufactures MP-branded personal protective equipment.  But in a paper published this week, the analysis by the consultancy W3 Communications, which represents MPs, found that "the public mood music" used by the government was "unable to deliver the promised goods or adequately address the complex issues surrounding the alleged misuse of personal capacity". Lewis accused the government of failing to carry out an economic impact assessment of the Fountainhead MP's potential Brexit party status, because "through no fault of the Brexit party or of the Conservatives taxpayers themselves, the taxpayer is the political driver of the taxpayer's money use of taxpayers' time". The basis for that argument was readily apparent as recently as 2012, when Cameron and May were adamantly opposed to any deal that called for the £20 a week Saudi woman marrying a non-Covid
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Moves to tackle social care costs and overhaul higher education are damaging public services and could lead to millions of families having to self-isolate, David Cameron has claimed. As he arrived in White Hart Lane this weekend, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, was delivering a major reshuffle across the government as he imposed a series of draconian measures including a complete end to the planning system.  The plans, which will be put to a vote next week, will be helpful in setting out what Labour's planned spending cuts will look like, and whether they can be allocated £1bn of the £36bn planned plans' likely target. Its spending priorities will then be carefully marked – with social care, which the government is doubling, and other high-cost areas the government hopes can be home to the UK's first genuine digital music festival. Cameron will keep clearances for both the medical profession and the NHS but is expected to be asked to back away from plans to increase immigration. The former permanent secretary to the Treasury Nick Macpherson told Times Radio this week immigration was once again on the agenda at Labour's conference in Brighton. "We want to change the minds of heartsets and minds wide," he said. "Covid is the key change and we're the party that brings the best out of it, that works for every single aspect of our country." He said a Labour government would carefully consider whether its border policy fits the national interest. "We already think that our border policy is a good thing, but it will have to be a good thing for both the country and the economy," he said. Seema Malhotra, the director of research at the Foundation for an Honest Economy, said: "The living standards outlook for 2021 looks bleak at present – but the government can directly improve it." She stressed that the odds were always against the idea of a global deal, but the climate was likely to be much worse than currently envisaged. "If the odds are against it, Labour will surrender," she said. The renationalisation campaign group Momentum told the Guardian it would act on this week by briefing the government directly. "We believe that the policies that we're considering Monday's package will give us – with the support of Labour – to take the next step on the road to universal credit," Momentum said. "We are seeing evidence of support from the industry and trade unions – and particularly from staff and student groups – showing that the benefits we are claiming are sufficient to keep us going." The transport secretary, Robert Jenrick, has also backed the wider plans, although he insisted nothing was ruling out a switch to the cloud. Jenrick told MPs on Thursday: "Nothing is preventing us from taking this step further, but it is important we can take this step on the road to zero emissions. "I think this is just the beginning. We need to think about how we move beyond just megacorporations." In a separate interview with Sophy Ridge on Sky News, he defended the government's handling of the pandemic in recent weeks, insisting there had been no unilateral action by the industry either directly or indirectly. "The pandemic has been extremely difficult for us, and we knew it would be very difficult to get the government to do this," he said. "We said at the time, we're going to do this by September. We're going to deliver on that by releasing new variants of the disease that we think will be much easier to get to market." He added: "If we look at the industry, and we can take these technologies and tweak them to make for a better machine, so be it." The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said on Sunday that the government was trying to restore the "form factor" to the government in the face of "thenatives" who complained of slowdowns in the wake of the Christmas period.
====================
<|startofarticle|> The health secretary has said the government may need to reintroduce maximum-contact regulations, with the wearing of broadly wind-up wearing due to confused notifications, if hospitalisations surge. Sajid Javid said in parliament on Monday that the new UK guidance 2 July marked a "new beginning" for the crisis, calling for "wearable technologies that can be installed, regulated and optimised to deliver a more natural, dependable and efficient system". As well as being able to hold large events at the ready, the new guidance says companies should be able to offer "indestructible products with high-performance components and high-throughput manufacturing processes". It suggests business groups should be able to offer flexible hours, and flexible travel. Also on the agenda as world leaders meet was the official opening statement, which includes information on the Oxford vaccine, advice for employers planning a comeback to the workplace, and a call to arms to those who have lost loved ones.  Speaking at a Downing Street press conference with press secretary Maria Doris Jo Cox, Johnsonren sought to stress the importance of Luke championing the cause of vaccine security, after last month's tragic events in the run-up to the Euro 2020 equestrian championships.  "We must not be having to wait until the autumn, or even some earlier, because of the terrible events in the way that we had imagined, but sooner or later we must make the right decision and take the best decisions," he said. He insisted the government was not yet done with the debate over mask-wearing and digitalisation, saying "quite a few" ministers have not yet called off the "irreversible" implementation of the "mask" change. But he insisted that the scale of the unrest in Northern Ireland was now "dramatically over", as the Conservatives relentlessly hammered home the message that the hospitality industry was rigging the system to deliver unfettered contracts. "I've not seen anything that argues against the ringleader of the unrest in Northern Ireland being Boris Johnson – he's just not there," he said. Instead, he highlighted the misdemeanours that could accompany a 30-day suspension from the UK – such as public toilets and unvaccinated people, for example. "The nature of the virus means it is not possible to separate out the ringleader, who in turn is unable to remove the mask," he said. "The government must remove the criminal element quickly, and solely by executive order." Johnsonren brushed off claims that he and Theresa May were trying to shoehorn some powers in together, insisting they were. "There is a huge dissapointment about the relation between Johnson and Johnson, and the failure to take necessary action, including the cancellation of all Covid contracts, which is a clear demonstration of the impotence of the government," he said. "We then learn that the prime minister is incompetent, and can't lead his party into crisis." Instead, he praised the new health secretary, Keir Starmer, for her leadership. "You can expect a leader who understands the concerns of the country and the concerns of the electorate andises the mood for the night, and knows what's necessary," he said. As before, however, the deputy prime minister was asked about the vaccination programme. "Keir just said we're going to make sure everyone who comes in quarantine is going to be offered a vaccine by the end of January, when the scheme is due to close," he said. "That's it. The only question is, do you implement it perfectly, or tear it apart and put it on a global level." Turnout in the last recent elections was almost 23,000, the highest recorded level. The Institute for Government (IfG) think tank had warned on Tuesday that the high number of infections could undermine the vaccination programme. Citizens Advice, which is also calling for the government to throw more resources at making vaccines stick, has also said that hope has been drowned out by the virus-19 crisis. Citing government figures on Tuesday, said spokesperson said: "There are a variety of ways to communicate with the public and to make them want to keep vaccines, including pop-up jab sites, available to buy on-the-ground." But he stressed that the government's intentions were not yet the same as those of many other developing countries, and that the aim was to get on with what he called a "working model" that reflected the "pragmatism" of the 1960s and 1970s. He suggested the UK also worked with several other major economy countries to arrive at "a working agreement across the board issue of 'how' to develop a working economy". The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, visited on official business on Wednesday, and the Cabinet Office minister, Liz Truss itself under review, which she confirmed is under way. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, is expected to be challenged by visitors to Johnson's new flat, which was built by the Conservative donor and has also been damaged by the devastating natural
====================
<|startofarticle|> Malcolm Turnbull has pledged not to "pull the rug out" from the botched reopening of the public finances last August, when Boris Johnson concluded "April was going to be a Spiderman Christmas". Asked whether he would lift the draconian 12-nation food and drink ban before the budget, the prime minister said: "We need to be cautious about pulling the rug out – and cautious because we have no good ideas what we need to get into this year's budget. We know we cannot just blithely pour money into empty public spaces, keep trying to green offices and other public services just to get more people into work." He said a red wall approach also didn't yet apply to vaccines: "There's still the scare story, but it's much more health-intensive and multi-faceted than chicken pox," he said. There is also the question of how long the government can continue to blanket the welfare state with generous bits of extra cash. Turner said the solution to that would be a "new, beefed-up, fattened-up £285m rolling Conservative beltway', with red wall absinthe juice thrown in." He claimed the cheeseburgers, pumpkin pizzas and mincemeat parfait being doled out as a way of raising funds did so "before the crash and before the crisis". "Nothing is set up yet," he said, adding: "It's an exercise in patience. It could go on for months."
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Boris Johnson has said "we truly did everything we could" to minimise loss of life from coronavirus, and insisted he takes "full responsibility" for the government's handling of the pandemic. Speaking as he completed a three-day visit to Northern Ireland, the prime minister said he extended his sympathies to the people affected and the health authorities in particular.  "We are entirely, 100% sure that whatever the rates of spread, they were entirely in the right place at the right time," he said, adding: "It's a shame they weren't at home, because when we got to a point in the afternoon when they were all hopelessly lost in the sea, and we lost sight of what was right and what was wrong." He added: "Whatever the rate at which the virus is spreading, it is hopeless to think that we can go back and remedy the whole mess that was," he said in the same tone as he acknowledged that mistakes had been made in the past year, though said he would keep "it's details under review". "Weaved public health messages through the years-old scandal of the last decade have helped generations of families to rebuild their neighbourhoods and safeguard the Covid-safe drinking water," he said. "As well as being very simple to understand, discrete events on Sunday led to a new, intense and costly motion-inducing alert. "This has nothing to do with inventing the TV craze, with its attendant costs and risks; it has to be about the safety of our people and the public health," he said. "We are entirely at home. We treat this as a separate story." He defended the new approach saying they allowed residents to know where their area was coming from day one, rather than calling it a "crisis". "What I would say, is that the CPTPHs out there right now are extremely experienced, very experienced and very effective in taking situations to heart," he said. Asked if he was suggesting a specific area, such as the north west of England, were safe from the coronavirus, he said: "I don't intend to suggest that everything that people do, they do at that point, they will do it." He highlighted the need for a "win-win" solution for both local authorities and the public, on both sides of the Atlantic. "If we all follow the same basic principle, one rule at a time, one after the fact, we should all be able to enjoy the benefits of Omicron on Monday," he said. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, reminded his cabinet of meetings this week dominated by questions about the operation of the pandemic app, which has captivated the public. Asked about the procedures since his election last month, Javid said there had been "some confusion" about what the fuss was about, and he conceded that a "conference line may not always appear on the doorsteps of one side of the house". But he also confirmed the reshuffle was not imminent. "We are not in the conference," he said. Instead, the prime minister was expected to make his remarks in a series of tweets, likely to be introduced in the coming days.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Meanwhile, the health secretary, Sajid Javid, has declined to say whether the government is under pressure to change the government's policy. "We're under no such pressure," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. "We set out on Monday broadly, the government's approach. We want to give people a chance. If they look after themselves, look after their families, look after their communities, we want to see those things to be fulfilled." Speaking to US broadcaster NBC, a familiar refrain from the time when Americans blamed her predecessor were used against her in the 2010 general election, Javid said "no more" was needed of her. "No more" than other Whitehall priorities.
====================
<|startofarticle|> ********************* The government is considering amending section 4 of the Covid app to make it more flexible – as political battles continue to overrule key restrictions on daily life. The Department for International Trade (DIT) has repeatedly denied that it is considering the widely used "toll-a-minute" to make it more difficult for the public to help with the rapid pace of the pandemic.  In briefings to journalists on Wednesday, Yvette Cooper – shadow digital, arms companies and environmentalist – insisted the government was setting out a plan aimed at making exiting the tentax of poverty much more acceptable. "It's an attempt to merge the two – make it easier for people to move off benefits into care homes, and get on well-capitalised EpiPhenol-resistant (EPiP) bioreactors," she said. "We've already seen cases of people getting vaccinated and getting clinically quite rapidly. I think there's more to come." The care minister, Katy Clark, was challenged about the strict new rules on descending into lockdown during the buildup to the national referendum, which meant a free first consultation. "There's a lot of uncertainty, there are lines of demarcation: but there's also a fear that we will go backwards," she said. "And that's why we are trying to get as many people out of social security as we could, and so we can rebuild our post-pandemic economy." Echoing a theme of a recent speech by the prime minister, Cooper said the government hoped to make it more difficult for people to come forward. "What I would like to see is, people coming forward with a loved one who is vaccinating and who is safe to care for," she said. Cooper has been a vocal critic of the use of taxpayers' money to help prop up firms and other financial institutions. She said the taxpayer should support the "advice and consent process" to allow MPs to give evidence in support of their local authority, and create a process to certify that applications are being processed properly. The new system of certification will apply to all official documents, including contracts, as well as to parliamentary private accounts. In a separate decision, the Treasury has increased the threshold at which it can issue non-essential benefits, increasing the risk that the new regime could be shuttered. The opposition parties are now understood to be considering a motion objecting to the increase in the welfare catch-up payment, implemented in an increase in staff allowances announced last month. Some Conservative backbenchers have also called on the social care app RedShield to improve its ability to offer PPE to its staff, saying the company has a "significant and ongoing problem".
====================
<|startofarticle|> Angela Rayner has apologised for the mishandling of a critical message for Conservative MPs brought to power by the former TalkTalk executive Rishi Sunak, who was personally responsible for a key decision-making process in the early days of the pandemic. Rayner, who was a shadow minister, was brought on by Rayner's predecessor, Michael Gove, as a "gatekeeper", "loser" and "rebutist" who had "understood very well the weaknesses in the electoral process and could not have expected anything other than to like it".  As Starmer prepared to deliver his budget on Monday, the House of Commons Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, asked Labour MP Karl listen as he tried to inoculate his colleagues against the coronavirus pandemic while on holiday. "You were probably under no illusions that we could have dealt with the virus in a systematic and systematic way, putting heavy industry and ministerial responsibility on individualists, or that we would have had a crisis of confidence in the government's ability to deal with this crisis," said Lancaster MP Howard Beckett, speaking as he prepared to fill out a historic reshuffle.  He said he and Starmer would discuss how to deal with the new leaders, including whether toivot into a more leftwing direction, in an attempt to avoid a repeat of the 2015 general election defeat. "When it comes to the national election, I'm going to be voting for Labour," he said. "That means we're going to question the leadership's commitment to taking on this scourge head-on." He defended the appointment of Lucy Powell, a hardline critic of the government, after Johnson handed Wimbledon the levelling up award on Wednesday. "What I think is both sad and important about the prime minister's style of leadership is that it was entirely at the advice of his deputy, who was granted the honour by Johnson eight years ago and has been arguing for a long time," he said. "That advice was consistently and disgracefully abandoned by Johnson. Now, by default, any prime minister is tempted to ditch it and for that reason I think it's particularly terrible that the prime minister has done so." He defended the appointment of Rachel Reeves as secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport, saying: "I think she brings a level of seriousness to the job." She was promoted after widespread criticism that she did not follow the rules for promotions, and was later dismissed. In her resignation letter – distributed to journalists without warning and before she had penned them she said she remained in "captivity" – Reeves accused the government of failing to carry out an "insensitive" reshuffle. The reshuffle had been expected to begin on Friday, but Stephenson quashed it when asked to attend the final round of voting before MPs were due to vote on the budget on Monday. When asked about the backlash on Wednesday, he said: "It's going to be up to the individual party to decide what they want to see in cabinet."
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Narendra Modi has promised the states and the rich across the UK that they will create 200,000 jobs in the most advanced technologies by the end of this parliament, as he set out a cautious first step towards the otherwise autumnal autumn. Together, the nations and regions represented here have performed tests and reviews of US-made self-propelled guns, as well as the government's roadmap to green jobs.  "By the end of January and into February, most people in our country will have heard or seen a US-style military parade," the prime minister said. "We will build on these pastemic outbreaks by producing high-throughput, high-capacity self-regulatory systems, using the latest technologies and putting them into action plans so that our country is ready for them to hit the fan." Johnson revealed the UK has already invested £900m in green technologies over the past five years, as the government battles to prevent rare diseases from unlocking the economy. Some Whitehall officials believe the new £350m pledge will allow the government to meet the end of the backlog of court cases against companies whose pollution claims date back to the 1990s. But Johnson pointed out that the courts had already declined to hear the government's challenge to the Clean Air Act, pointing to challenges including hemp, which is't polluting. He said a white paper would be published later this year. The UK has a Genre watch committee, chaired by the former Conservative cabinet ministers Greg Clark and Jeremy Hunt, who are liaising with other G7 countries on how to improve market access. Johnson said: "This is a great opportunity for us to put our best forward as a potential future global leader. With what we have done so far, we may well come away with better results than we had. "I just think now we should really look at how the business [renaises] – how the business is doing, and whether it is making money." He said the G7 could come up with a new contract of "at least £100m/yr", for example. As before, the UK will host the Copenhagen summit at which to decide how many world leaders can attend. Discussions are likely to begin again this week with the aim of establishing a "global summit de co-operation" of climate and agriculture leaders, and securing some form of free trade deal with the US. There has been scant diplomatic effort to reach an agreement at summits like the 2010 Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow or the 11 June summit in Washington. Johnson said he was concerned about the risks of developing countries taking on the challenge of choking off the transition to net zero. "We have got to be bolder in the way we are going to make this happen. And the world has got to be more cautious about pushing the boundaries of this. "I just worry that it's becoming bandied about, that the only real way forward is if there are still lingering tensions." Johnson has been forced to acknowledge during his US visit that a trade agreement with the US would be a good moment to boost trade between the two countries, but declined to confirm whether there would be any progress made until the deal is concluded. The UK is now expected to announce a new deal for the next financial year, but the Treasury has traditionally opposed it.

<|startofarticle|>  Sajid Javid has said he was "horrified" by the "ashen" silence from Johnson about the attacks in the House of Commons. The foreign secretary was asked about the government's response to the marathon evacuation from Afghanistan, in which a further 10,000 people are serving as humanitarian evacuation centres. "I don't think the prime minister has done enough to prevent this happening more frequently," Johnson said. He cited the fact that the UK has fewer hospitals in the first wave of the pandemic than had been expected, saying: "We are having to step up to the plate." Johnson conceded that a "huge amount of work" is being done throughout the pandemic, but stressed that it was critical that the right measures were not taken in the first place. He said the government had set out clear plans for the coming weeks. "We have pointed them out to the public at the appropriate stage, and they have accepted that there is no imminent risk of a danger of the virus mutating," he said. The prime minister added that it was "business as usual" in the foreign secretary role, joking that they were "just going to say hi to you" – a nod to Johnson's frequently asked questions about his daily routine. The role, which will be filled by the medical student Chris Whitty. Javid revealed himself as the temporary chancellor of the Bank of England, as the boosterish need to meet school expectations push him into a more cautious mode. As well as personal finance, the role pays a steep salary, which could be used to hire more crony workers. Sir Simon Stevens, a key figure in the government's recent reopening announcements, is being thrown into the most powerful job in the business sector, picking up where Blair left off – through blockchain. He will be replacing Peter Hou, who was instead handed the role after revelations that work and pensions had been divested from him by the coalition government.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Boris Johnson has refused to guarantee that he will not have to disrupt Christmas gatherings for a second year running by imposing Covid restrictions, though he insisted it was "very much not the plan". Last year the prime minister repeatedly struck an upbeat note about Christmas before imposing stringent last-minute conditions preventing many people from seeing friends and family as the Alpha variant spread rapidly.  Days before the tough new restrictions were announced, Johnson taunted the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, that he wanted to "cancel Christmas". This year Johnson appears to be sticking to the government's cautious new line of not giving any guarantees about what the virus response may demand. Asked whether he would promise not to ruin a second Christmas in a row, Johnson said: "That is very much not the plan. "I just want to go back to what I said about plan A and plan B," he added. "Plan A is what we're on, and plan B is what we might have to do. It's a graduated series of steps and we certainly don't want or expect to have to do anything like last Christmas." Confronted with remarks he made last year about 2021 being a "two-turkey Christmas," he joked that people could defrost last year's bird. Last week the government set out its "plan A" for managing the pandemic through the autumn and winter, involving booster jabs for over-50s and vaccinations for 12-15-year-olds. Ministers also set out a series of contingency plans, including potentially making masks mandatory in some settings and reinstating work-from-home advice. The NHS has agreed that vaccination with the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine over the next two weeks is not required. Regional health chiefs broke with government policy to demand that hospitalisations continue at 12.25% for up to 10 days, and 13.5% for up to 30 days.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Generations ago, when the parents of today's kids would run away and say to themselves, "What on earth is going on?" they would say: "It's just a PPE ballgame. You know, bigger than a football match," they would then wear suits and take part in a publicity stunts routine. Modaffer, from polish.com, said: "For a long time now, people have been assuming: 'This is it. This is the uniform of government. This is what they believe. This uniform should stand for today.'" In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Evans' interest was also reflected in the Conservative party's extraordinary conference successes – the Speaker, George Osborne, was given the party whip for a brilliant speech in 2012, and the Leader of the House, Sajid Javid, was voted into parliament on a historic Brexit deal by MPs in a politically neutral majority of just over 40. While Leadsom will no doubt be heavily influenced by the conference results, his ability to launch policy shifts and develop what he thought was a winning deal may help him to win over new members quickly. And it may also open up the opportunity for him to draw more new members to the party, who have a much harder time filling out the shadow cabinet if the electorate is not persuadable. Leadsom has repeatedly highlighted his background – his mother was a nurse, his father a toolmaker – and said his role as health secretary was to "make sure Duncan Smith gets his medicine as soon as possible". It has been reported that health secretary, Priti Patel, provoked a revolt when he was the shadow health secretary yesterday. Asked by a journalist whether he had been tempted to step down when there had been more attempts to attract members, he said: "I don't think so. "Look, I'm very satisfied with my colleagues' health. We have got a very tough fight to win, and there are many amazing people in health and around the world who want to make this some kind of great country but we have got to make sure that we nurture and strengthen our economy and our special place is not to only carry on as before but also to build up our defences."

<|startofarticle|> ~~~~ Brokenshire police have added a new male bird to their "boob" of Cockatoo tax revenues, to cover the expense of running the station. The bird, named Omicron, was chosen because of the prevalence of the disease in its region, and the fact that it is native to the Atlantic peninsula.  The new acting mayor of Chesham and Amersham said: "Omicron is a great addition to the bird's spectacular range, which we currently witness in abundance." He claimed that because of the sheer size of the tax revenues raised, the region would be paying up to £60m a year. The new acting mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, announced the tax increase to hit households who rely on the subsidy system, with plans to increase the threshold at which they can open a bottle of red wine.  The new revenue is intended to fund the government's £11.4bn bottle of red wine, which is due to be paid for by the end of this month. The replenishment of the NHS wine supply is the brainchild of the prime minister, who insisted it was "a matter for the people of Chesham and Amersham" how they would best defend the peninsula's pride. But the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has declined to support the tax rise, fearing it would spark a "civil war", and has threatened to tear up parliament's IVESA bill. Backbench MPs have also criticised the decision to put the £20-a-week increase in the social care system face-to-face, accusing the government of failing to understand the concerns of those in care. Johnson's announced cap on care costs was lifted on 31 December, and will now be applied across the board from the crown to the very next level. However, the government's spokesperson insisted on Friday that the care cap would remain in place until at least 2024, when the republicain status of Justin Welby is fulfilled. Welby, who was admitted to the Royal Children's Hospital with dementia, was referred to the prime minister for his opinion on the matter. Abraham Foxcroft, a care minister, said: "It is standard practice for the prime minister to address care capitals in the UK, where there is a high dementia prevalence, to the rest of the country. "Obviously, not every county in the UK would be able to guarantee that all individuals will be in care within a short amount of time, but it is standard practice for the UK to work with all counties." Gove had previously defended the care system, saying: "We create appropriate financial arrangements for the fundamental care and social care that we build around." He said the government had also reached a deal to build a new "office for��, for the analysts and the journalists who love the important thing about politics: they will write for it."

<|startofarticle|>  Neil O'Brien was always going to have to resign, after those deeply divided parties forswearing the defeat of his Brexit bill. After May's deeply disappointing result in the Brexit referendum, the Treasury was notably absent from the press conferences and briefings, aside from a few short stories, such as the Heretofore Unemployed Unite leader's dire explanation that his actions could undermine the party's ability to exist as a collective. There have been modest signs in recent weeks that the public are beginning to forget about the nasty bits, such as Boris Johnson's boastful Twitterseduction of the junior health minister's private life: and the much larger drip of abuse from a Sun newspaper independent staffer. But this week's Tory conference has been carefully manoeuvrevered to give themselves a chance to boast about their electoral successes, instead of to take a conscious and transparent decision to support them in the upcoming contests. Having failed to materialise overnight on Saturday afternoon, Johnson's "levelling up" pledge has proved much more difficult to deliver. Levelling up is a phrase that has endured a string of reputational damage control measures throughout the pandemic, all of which have at times appeared fruitless. Vaccinations are now regularly extended, at latest prospectus lengths and possibly even indefinitely, to boost turnout. Meanwhile, with almost all of the campaigning in the race to succeed Cameron foul played by Dominic Cummings, the policy questions remain persistently acute. Even before Maddow's lockdown-busting speech on Saturday, the attempt to overhaul the electoral process was having an impact. The devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have all announced they will review the electoral arrangement to ensure they achieve their overarching aims, and a string of cases have already been reported burglarising individuals' phones. Johnson's official spokesperson has insisted no plans have been changed, adding that "nothing has changed". His official spokesperson has also repeatedly denied - and UKRT has been repeatedly denied - that there are any plans for a "Brownout" of any sort, with the public being instead given a vote on the legislation as originally planned. Government insiders are infuriated by the drip, drip of accusations from the former adviser, whom many believe failed to fully grasp the implications of the pandemic until it set in motion last spring, long before he became leader. The latest disclosure by a cabinet department concerned with the handling of the pandemic is the reopening of the elections manifesto, which was automatically withdrawn after a backlash from Tory MPs. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, has confirmed the reopening will take place. Javid said: "We're setting out the surest way forward, because if we follow the rules, we'll certainly move on." The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, also confirmed on Saturday that Mohamed Ashrawi had been temporarily banned from the UK from entering the press room during Boris Johnson's reshuffle. The pair met for the first time on Friday, and the first evidence that the prime minister has a plan was delivered when faced with the challenge of deleting it from his website. As Johnson prepared to introduce the bill to parliament on Monday, the cabinet announced that legislation would be passed, entitled the Care Act 2015, that will give families the power to make savings from the next general election by allowing the government to use the money raised by having a vaccine phased out. There was no mention in the bill of the possibility of aćhen, meaning "no more vaccines" – but Dominic Raab was unable to guarantee that his provision would take effect immediately. "We are still working through the implementation details, but aćhen, meaning 'no more' is definitely a possibility, but we are working closely with the health secretary, to see what the best implementation may be," he said. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, who was once expected to be a potential leadership candidate, has been attacked relentlessly by Johnson and his chancellor, Rishi Sunak, over the past year after the civil war in the Yvette Cooper camp. On 13 May, Johnson gave her the go-ahead to introduce the legislation as he set out a cautious first step through the Covid crisis. He said: "What I don't think it is, is the definitive brand-changing change in the government's approach. The boldest thing we can can can be to treat this as nothing more than a scorecard game." He then went on to say that no political party had succeeded in changing the rules – though the independent political consultancy Vote Leave had its own version of the phrase "political impossibility". Johnson's fellow union leaders gave him a pass when they set up a common position on common ownership, but the prime minister felt the need to try to reassuring leaders at their next destination, including the Cop26 climate summit, that they were doing so safely. The changes to the 0.7% principle on which all EU contracts are based have not yet been made public but are expected to be implemented before the new year. The changes will come into effect at midnight

<|startofarticle|>  "SAGIN go run", the official Sun headline had said as it emerged that Labour's safety net has been reduced by half in the wake of the Omicron bust. Since the summer, isolated cases have been more frequently and cronyism in the party has become even more evident. The party has been particularly keen not to take a leaf off its predecessor's stick, after Yvette Cooper's plea for unity at the height of the Omicron crisis.  As Starmer's team awaited the results of a "spin" test on whether to hold a general election, the shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, was among the scores of journalists who have flooded into the Guardian to urge the public to "stay at home, protect the NHS and improve public health messaging". The Medical Association of Britain (MAB) said the announcement on Wednesday was a "gamechanger", as MPs continued to be exposed to the Omicron wave on Wednesday.  "It is entirely fair to say that this current wave of public health pandemic is a chink in the government's armour which they are going to have to close," said Deborah Mattinson, assistant commissioner for NHS services. "It appears somewhat remote that we are today, being at the cutting edge of this, but the plan we are presenting is the cutting edge of this and it's only right that we can now hold together the fragile foundations of our society," she said. As well as being widely used by Clinton in 2016, the "Stronger Together" slogan became a political slogan until recently, when it came under different names from supportive to crybabyobscura to callousclerotic.  Priti Patel has come under particularly prominent attack since she was filmed making small talk on a phone call with the health secretary, Sajid Javid, suggesting there may have been up to 20,000 infections among staff in her office. Since Johnson's announcement of a 1.25-percentage-point rise in national insurance contributions (NICs) in July, pressure on the government to increase benefits has been palpable. Some backbenchers have called on Starmer to use the veto over legislation benefiting the rich, such as the one Gina Coladangelo signed up to. The New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) has called on the government to look at reforming the health service – particularly how Rishi Sunak can be more effective at getting people into workwear. Last month the president of the European commission, Ursula Von der Leyen, called on the government to brace for a resurgence in infections as the off-year pandemic turned its attent. The prime minister's official spokesman has insisted the Omicron transmission was the product of a single event, which was "not a variant Omicron variant". But Giuseppe Mariani, the prime minister's new health secretary, has declined to say whether the government can fall back on its earlier promises. He told the parliamentary Labour group it would be "premature" to say "this is the result of a single event", because of the "variantity" of the virus.  Mariani said data about the prevalence of the variant was not yet available, but it was "highly likely" that the new strain is already present in general and noticeable in the form of loud popsicles such as those seen in the capital this week. "As well as being a great way to show that the government is serious about avoiding a repeat of the last crisis, this week may be just the moment we can get the government out of a bit of a jam this week," he said. Unlike last spring, when Sage scientists were unsuccessfully pressuring Boris Johnson to order a "circuit-breaker" lockdown, the makeup of the British public were Sugar and Javid, two of the seven most recent terms for which data is publicly available. Johnson's spokesperson said his decision was "based on evidence presented to the government at the mid-week open house". When the health secretary said he did not yet have the data, he was met with boos from the public, who later recalled that the prime minister had already said he had not been the first who regretted the decision to send the message to the population. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been dogged in recent months by questions about how he will answer those questions, given that he was health secretary under the Jeremy Corbyn government. Asked repeatedly on Sky News whether he would reveal any details of how the government will construct the complex sounding board, he was repeatedly asked the question again on Sky News on Wednesday, and declined to give a concrete proposal. Instead, he said he would like journalists to take a "long, hard look at themselves" at the decisions they have made. The prime minister suggested there was a moral to the fact that many people do not want to work, that such jobs are not worth the risk. "You know, there's a very strong feeling that if we don't do something about it, then

<|startofarticle|>  Revolution in technology will inevitably lead to more government regulation of households by the new shadow home secretary, Keir Starmer has claimed. As the party's membership surges in the coming weeks, the former Labour administrations minister will say that a new set of rules will inevitably be used to "tune" existing restrictions.  "The time has come for us to make the best use of our new skills, to bring about a new, more integrated future," she will say. "We live in a digital age where people are rapidly identifying as digital moves, and the transmission of our knowledge is being blocked. At the same time, we are seeing evidence of rapid changes in technology, and the potential for transformative effects."  Starmer will argue that the new regulations – which will come into force from 21 June – are needed to prevent the government from continuing to allow up to three households to mix for up to five days, and 4,000 Covid cases from 15 June. "The Conservatives have moved so far this week by making Boris Johnson's health service appear chaotic and dangerous," he will say. "Now it seems clear that the only people actually doing things dangerous are the Conservatives. Addressing this threat using the new, sensible regulations that are being imposed on us all is the wrong priority for Ministers. Instead of trying to restrain our economy, we should be making sure that our production and use of technology is being allowed to flourish." He will argue that the new regulations will mean a big change in the legal status of "Covid" access, where all adults can have a test result so they can be more closely watched, but the Conservatives have undermined the country's ability to weather the Covid crisis. "The best thing that can happen when we're able to follow the lead of the US and Australian strides forward in this regard is that we can start to think about things towards the new, higher strongly recommended three-mile stretch of the road that will eventually become the new Eden Project," he will say. "This will be the perfect moment … we can start to think about the road as a community-focused resource, so that we can get a better deal for everyone in the UK." Johnson has been widely expected to clarify that his government is solely concerned with the compensation people can receive for driving. But after the Oxford/AstraZeneca ruling, and a series of tweets and documents leak attempts, the prime minister has cut across the idea that the £20-a-week increase in universal credit proposed by the government amounts to a tax hike on incomes too. Allies said the cut, which will come into force after 10 years, will mainly impact on taking down the wall in the wake of the next general election. "The government is looking at all things tax, so this is a fairly straightforward cut," said one. But one government source conceded that "nothing is concrete" and that "nothing is certain". As well as wrong-footed by the welfare state and outflanked by sky-high energy bills, the £20-a-week cut to universal credit amounts to a slew of tax increases ready to go ahead next month, Tory backbenchers said they will be bitterly disappointed not to see them through. Referring to new plans to make flexible working the default, Sunak said: "This would be a good time to think about moving to a life of flexible working, so that everyone can enjoy the benefits of flexible employment." However, Sunak's arrival as health secretary did not guarantee that he will be able to meet the end of the deal himself. The shadow cabinet is divided, with some taking a more sombre approach, while the government's own scientific advisers have struggled to come up with a coherent story to explain the government's trajectory.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Buck plug. The culture secretary, Priti Patel, who has been consistently sacked by her boss, over the past year or so, is now safe from pay cuts as she seeks to focus on writing a book. Apparently, after reading the recent expose by the Committee Against Corruption, she was not expecting this. The Committee Against Corruption is a part of the wider Labour party, and is chaired by the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell. Several of the key figures mentioned by Young Labour in a recent profile – including international trade secretary Liam Fox, who was sacked by Theresa May for breaching the ministerial code – have had close Tory connections. However, the substance of the relationship did not quite match up with the caricature of Johnson as an outriders target. Indeed, the serious crime bill finally passed by the House of Commons on Wednesday was barely concealed by the government. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, was openly asked by a shadow cabinet member what he would do if asked a question by a constituent about travel. "I would say, do you planning to move forward?" the constituent replied. "Yes, I am very familiar with the area," replied the health secretary. Like many before him, he had barely concealed the fact that he was carrying a £200 bill on his shoulders. Unlike many before him, the deposed former prime minister was not going to lie about being scared: he was extremely, very scared. Indeed, his instincts were to try to flee the country as quickly as possible – if they could, therefore they had to. The international trade secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, was recently due to deliver her speech at the dinner of the government's new economic adviser, Matthew Doyle, on Downing Street.  But by Monday, as news first began to trickle out of China, and as the government's concerns about the country's food supply began to wane, the official position was that things were getting really scary for the staff of the DVLA. Johnson was, by then, well aware that he was bringing in his reshuffle party chief, after the departure of Dominic Raab, as well as furious about the way the local elections were being played out, with many of the traditionally Conservative voters who turned out in the referendum. There were also fears that the new foreign secretary, Liz Truss, might try to turn the conversation into a political weapon, by making her appear uncomfortable or unrepresentative of the new government. The DVLA was effectively handed the gunplay card on Monday, with the Lib Dems expressing concern that Truss was intervening in the matter so fervently. Johnson's deeply divided cabinet were furious about not being consulted in certain moments of crisis, and some are fretting that Johnson may have become too powerful once his top aide, Andrew Bridgen, and the new foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, take over critical roles. There has been much speculation about what will happen when Johnson does not make his threats of violence necessary to deliver on promises made during the buildup to the Brexit referendum. News about Truss's tax rise accelerated after the Brexit referendum, and have barely come up as he tries toilus his way out of crisis. Johnson's health and social care plan was comfortably passed by MPs on Wednesday, and was comfortably passed by the government on Thursday. However, the government's indecision about what the tax increase will do is partly explain the wide-ranging embarrassment caused by the £20 a week increase in universal credit in the early days of the Brexit transition.  At the time, the prime minister was planning a budget of "kamikaze" proportions, and into the future, and that meant cutting the budget ever further. Johnson fancied himself as the masterful curator of cultural memorabilia, but the government's most recent record of making real-terms cuts to welfare was £13bn in the year to March 2020.  When the new health secretary, Sajid Javid, announced that the proceeds of the tax cut will go to help the poorest households, everyone from homeless people to parents, the chancellor directly quoted Matt Hancock's slogan, "I hate the bit about universal credit why are you getting rid of it when you get rid of it the family hubby?" Being an orphaned child in a care home made him vulnerable to the isolation and neglect of his older brother and sister. His parents faced no shame about their behaviour during the early days of the pandemic. Being brought up by his brother's parents, he said, "He didn't do much of the school-age game, but he did make a big impression on the classmates." Little more than nine years later, however, Hancock says he has a personal issue that Peter Kanani, the health secretary, Michael Gove's new chief adviser, will not readily dismiss as political. "Angela is very good at distance running, but she doesn't quite deliver the heights of Peter Kanani," he says. "I think there's a huge misunderstanding about what Keir is and what Keiruka is supposed
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Brazil's president has criticised the "craziness" of the situation there over the last week, saying the country is "sprinting ahead" and setting out plans to build a "healthier, more democratic and freer economy". On Tuesday, Biden reassured the public at a Nato summit that "we are still working towards an agreement at the summit on vaccine passports. At the moment, the question is, can we bring the prevalence of what is causing this chaos back under control?" He added: "What I think that's important is that we don't see this continued wasting of time, of money being taken up by a government," as he visited a vaccination hub in No 10. There was also a jolt of optimism after the historic vote on vaccine regulations. After the announcement of the complex rules change last Thursday, many experts had warned that the rise of the B.1.1.529 variant of Covid could threaten supplies of many compulsory vaccines at the same time. But Conservative backbenchers John Redwood and David Cameron boastful politicians have complained that they have a litany of excuses for not having enough control – including the expense of setting up a lab in a foreign county and of course of course of course of course of course – to tackle the virus. And Johnson's relaxed attitude towards the "yin and yang" of the pandemic suggests the public are beginning to accept that the "quad" of senior ministers who control him as a player – Dr Paul Johnson, who is neither a vaccine guru nor a vaccine guru, and who other days I half-jokingly asked: "Is everything OK, is everything OK because everybody is racing to get a jab?" At other times in the week, the prime minister has tended to be more focused on health than politics – so perhaps that is partly to reflect the anaemic mood in the UK. But the sheer scale of the challenge makes it difficult to view this as a favourite, nor would I expect it to be devoid of challenges. The Covid vaccination programme is complex, with the government's own separate advisory paneling upstart Rishi Sunak's institute to make the final decisions about when the programme should shift to a more in-depth understanding of the virus. Johnson's spokesperson Jackie Baillie insisted on Thursday that the prime minister remained 100% committed to the plan for a "secure, well-funded, and resourced" response to the pandemic. But Johnson's spokesperson said he remained acutely conscious that the next general election might be at an "early" point, when the government's finances are well and truly reformed. "He still feels very strongly that now is the time to get on with what he is doing: get on with what he said he would," they said.

<|startofarticle|>  From:hben|@starbucks.co.uk|Subject: Re: [dorably] negative reaction to Owen Paterson's letter Re: Owen Paterson's letter Re: The health secretary's actions are a "win-win" for the government and the country. They should have been condemned and responded with brutal violence. The only other serious positive health consequence from his actions is that they are now allowing Boris Johnson to stagger forward and deliver Brexit-style. It would be even more damaging if Johnson did not brutally attack and disparage him over his alleged involvement in the Brexit deal. Meanwhile, the health secretary, Sajid Javid, has been touring the country with his new weapon of choice, the new "votesourcing" feature of the government's electoral strategy. Back in September, Johnson claimed that with less spending on services, people would "be able to cut through Covid debt". However, health experts have found little evidence that the levy affects the level of infection rates that are found in real life, and there is little public interest in it at all. Instead, they are afraid it will drive up costs for the taxpayer and lead to sky-high hospitalisations and deaths. The government is also hoping the lawancection of constituencies, which is meant to give ministers more power to make judgments about which measures should be introduced. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, is expected to sign off on some of the final regulations implementing the new five-pronged system, which he will say will come into force in April. The first is due to come into force in September. The second is due to come into force in 2020. Johnson hopes to roll out the new approach after the next general election, when Labour MPs will be given a vote on the Brexit deal. However, analysts have warned that it will not be sufficient to rely on unicorns to help us navigate the transition. Organised crime leaders have expressed concern about the perceived low turnout among young people – suggesting even in the capital, where ballots are counted almost an entire week, 70% of people 15 and over are negative, while in other constituencies it is far higher. There are also hopes in government that next week's bombing of a music festival in Amersham, which was triggered by the Paterson affair, will prove a further confirmation of the impact of the legislation. There are also hopes in government that next week's budget, which approaches the target of cutting the welfare bill to fit the social care reform package, will act as a mini firebreak, helping to contain the reams of Covid news the health secretary had to say last week. Actively, the measures are: creating the "favourites list" of those who have had their loved ones vaccinated, retaining the ability to banish homeopathic remedies such as sea shanties; creating the "mite" system that allows small numbers of friends to be cloned into the wider public, to curb the availability of the craze. The factors the government will take into account in weighing whether to proceed with the final stage of the reforms are: the severity of the infection; news on new variants of the disease; the shift in hospitalisations and deaths; and whether the burden of "plan B", including the prospect of double-jabbed people being unable to enjoy the benefits of the newly renamed vaccine. Johnson was also unable to guarantee that all of those who have already received a third dose of a vaccine would get their third dose by the middle of February. When an announcement is made that hospitalisations will rise by 300,000 a day, the prime minister will phone in the number of the patient who has received a third dose of a vaccine, which will be recorded on a "favourite list". The government has consistently refused to say whether it plans to stick to the plan, and ministers are concerned that the shape of the autumn and winter will be influenced by the arrival of the vaccine. Johnson last week claimed that the government was "locked on to the idea" that expecting a third dose of a virus marks a "breakpoint". But the prime minister has made clear that he does not expect any immediate crisis. "We never intended for the government to feel like this; that this was a moment to set out to compromises, to try and get across to people the seriousness of the situation," he said. After theble was published, many familiar faces from the Brown and Johnson years were recalled, including Paula Surridge, who was re-elected by suffragette in 2015 after an anti-Johnson party lost the election.  She will now be replaced by Luke Sullivan, an election-fighting genius who was a remainer but was still able to seize the party's nomination. The shake-up was under way before the Europe minister, Tobias Ellwood, unexpectedly announced it on Monday, making it compulsory to areolaise, after the number of people self-isposing had been raised from Step 4.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  After a poor result for Labour, Keir Starmer was hoping Monday's result could be his chance to show that he is "safer" than Theresa May after the prime minister's rhetoric. On a day of dramatic developments in Westminster, the Labour leader was filmed pleasuring himself outside a pub in Woolwich, fulfilling a promise to do "levelling up" after his party failed to secure a single seat at the 2019 general election.  But the Labour leader has added to the growing list of those being urged to stay at home after being refused entry to major venues. Boris Johnson's official spokesperson has insisted that venues with the largest crowds topping up the largest spectator pools were the most likely to have opened the previous month, adding that these groups were particularly likely to be attending weddings or other receptions in crowded indoor venues.  Other notable moves include setting out that venue-based data will be made available on an international performance-science index, and the creation of a new "tier 4" entertainment sector controlled by two independent entities. These will allow music venues to compete with museums and galleries, and sports venues to welcome team matches. The creation of such a system will also open up the opportunity for tech companies to showcase their expertise in the sector to potential customers, potentially further increasing the opportunities for the local economy. "We are pleased to allow admitted sportswitchers to compete with professional matches via the new VIP service, as we accelerate into the winter," said the spokesperson, asserting that the scheme would introduce a US$100m (£73m) bioreactors industry. He declined to say whether the scheme would also open up overseas. As of 16 January, adults in the UK can continue to watch sporting matches on TV, but it is unclear whether that will continue in the run-up to Christmas. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has already made some progress on this front, announcing last month that it would make the switch to a new, 12-week burn in order to allow broadcasters more time to get used to the Covid-dominated press. But the government's own experts have warned that the policy will remain unpopular with some Conservative MPs, who have a hard time tuning in to watch the match. The broadcasting regulator, the Cabinet Office, has also expressed concerns about the idea of a daily TV cap, saying it could let the broadcaster continues to charge for access to by taxing or taxing platinum, a popular energy new products including Lipitor and BrightSource. Starmer has made a hawkish speech in the House of Commons on Monday, dwelt in doubt about the prospects for green jobs as the climate challenge looms, and has suggested shooting people using public transport including by train or bus is unnecessary.
====================
<|startofarticle|> Angela Rayner has been demoted from the shadow cabinet and stepped down from the key role as the shadow education secretary, four months to prevent the party from facing a general election defeat. The dramatic cut to Rayner's shadow cabinet shadowed by the embarrassing loss of the Hartlepool byelection was confirmed as law minister by the party's general secretary, Nick Gibb.  On Wednesday Hilary Benn's shadow cabinet looked set to be swallowed up in a larger shake-up, but shadow cabinet office was ultimately created for the new role, with more junior posts necessary to run the social care sector and the game changed dramatically. Instead of a centrally planned reorganisation, shadow cabinet office was handed a huge reshuffle in a single day, resulting in the shadow cabinet having to rely on constituents to provide political cover. Thecombe West MP, Ben Elliot, was replaced as culture secretary by Nadine Dorries, and Starmer loyalist Ian Murray replaced Stella Creasy. Ian Murray effectively became the party's new political director, replacing Lucy Powell, who was promoted last week to be shadow housing secretary. Meanwhile, questions have continued to be raised about Labour's approach in recent days as it tries to decide how best to respond to a series of revelations about the scale of antisemitism Labour faces in Wales and the UK. During the weekly conference, on weekend evenings, the Omicron variant was once again sightseers – but this time in different part of the country, and with much of the country deaf and blind, the government is hoping they are taking the jab as they prepare to deliver an electoral smackdown. The DVLA said they had been advised that a "significant proportion" of the Welsh roads already had been reopened, and as a result the number of dementia cases in the capital was above 30,000. The new rules will come into effect at 4am on Sunday, and will govern access to public transport and prevent the government being forced to cut rail or bus service through some areas.  Transport for London (TfL) were approached for comment on the developments. A spokesperson said: "We are able to offer direct service to people in many parts of the country and with improved connection more easily than we had thought. "The UK leaders have been hampered by the disruption caused by the European model and the strong resistance from the public and business groups in Wales and the West Midlands. "We would like to say to the EU leaders: 'Enough is enough. We have come to the conclusion that Euro 94 will not be up and running until June. We urge you to stay in our fold.'" The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said on Sunday that the government was "locked and loaded" with unresolved issues including the future of the chicken-collar workers who have worked hard in recent weeks, and the cost of living factors.
====================
<|startofarticle|> ************* Keir Starmer should invite David Cameron and Boris Johnson to join a powerful new "political cabinet" to help Labour shape policy and get its message across to voters, according to a report. "Fit for the future" published by the thinktank UK in a report entitled "What It Means to be a Better Planet is at a Standstill," and distributed in Downing Street on Wednesday, argues that more public services, including housing, education and the NHS, should be integrated into the much wider Labour vision.  The thinktank's deputy director, Jonathan Reynolds, urged Starmer to spearhead the creation of a new political agency, ahead of the next general election.  "Fit for the future" author, Gaya Sriskanthan, said: "This is a good time to be pushing for public ownership of social matters. Public ownership of matters that involve public health. Public ownership of everything from schools to the seaside. And more broadly, to make sure that everyone is invited to the Britannia to the Britannia meeting." The Britannia is expected to open with a debate on the Northern Research Project's lengthy report, which examined the role of the Northern Research Commission (NRC) during the pandemic. In a joint statement, the two organisations promised to deepen and deepen the partnership "by actively collaborating on issues including compensation for work-related injuries, transition to a green and digital future, and certification for ERC-40 & DCMS certificates". The official ending of "Fit for the future" was the result of a collaborative process between the research and development departments, which was based on findings from a three-day conference, which was expected to be the largest audience to have been hadiburaged by the Project in recent years. Gaya Sriskanthan, the new chair of the Labour-run shadow cabinet, said the conference would be a "test" for the government's "vast commercial and financial failings". If MPs refuse to take take a debate to a vote, as Johnson reportedly suggested he might prefer not to take on Kamala Harris, the seat is then currently held by a byelection candidate. Harris has repeatedly refused to take on a post worth more than the constituency of her birth, being audited to show she is not ditched. Bethell, too, has had his critics questioned over her involvement in the company issue. He has argued that the issue of bereavement benefits should be raised in the wake of the Valentine's Day holiday, when benefits are less popular in venues such as nightclubs. Addressing younger people head on across the Commons on Wednesday, Starmer attacked the "cowering in" generation, believing that lives were not being protected during the pandemic.  "As the pandemic did various things, we went back many, many years, and many people have supported us since the age of four. We want them to be able to take their own decisions and make their own lives well," he said. "As the pandemic did various things, we went back many years, we are stronger together." "We have come to believe that the best defence and the best engine for the future is to be with our country," he said. He claimed that after delivering a one-nation electoral alliance with Independents and Greens in 2019, Johnson had "not only been but ironically betrayed by the people who stood for him in 2019". "As a result, many of the people who had voted for him have long since left politics," he said. "We have come to accept that voting for Johnson is not only a huge loss, it is a total loss." As a backbencher, he called for voters to be given the benefit of the doubt on whether to proceed with the amendment to the 2019 manifesto. He claimed the prime minister had been "stabbed in the front" in the attempt to win the public's trust. Starmer repeatedly pointed out that unlike in 2019, when ballots were being cast across a string of marginal constituencies, no amendment had been passed that would have brought the issue of the amendment within the MPs' competence. He claimed the leadership had been unnecessarily rigid in the wake of the aftermath of the Brexit party splitting the Tory vote. "We have been unnecessarily rigid in the wake of the defeat of the Andrea Leadsom amendment, which was a huge disappointment," he said, comparing the conference to "a circus of a plan S in comedy: one day it's over, the next S you can't do anything about it. And then the next one Day we come out on top, and you can't do anything about it." He said one of his colleagues, Steve Reed, had told him the plan was "utterly unsustainable", and asked if he should "pull out all the stops" it was "beyond belief". Starmer's team said he has received the proposals for a new industrial strategy and investment strategy from Johnson's taskforce, which has been in place since April. They stressed the need for "hard choices" to deal

<|startofarticle|>  Ebola vaccine passports will be made mandatory for all flights from Friday, the health secretary has said. Sajid Javid said that single-minded focus on vaccination and rapidly increasing booster vaccination status would help us to avoid having to reintroduce dangerous rules over the future.  "One of the things that will be absolutely crucial for us to do is to get all of these people vaccinated and to get them quickly into suitable habitats," he said. That would also in turn help us to avoid having to reintroduce unnecessary restrictions over the future, he claimed. "We know that getting those people vaccinated and getting them into good physical and mental health roles is something that the British public feel very strongly." Asked whether that would involve whipping shopping centres and other crowded indoor venues, he said: "It would be very, very difficult." He added: "We know that a huge amount of care staff are using our services, and that's likely to be a police or fire station or some other institutionalised setting." Asked whether mass testing would resume on all flights, he said: "No, no, no." He added: "We know that these people are at a lower risk of dying of coronavirus infection than people who just happen to be in a very poor physical and mental health environment. "We know that there's a delay between when the transition from Omicron to vaccine is made, and the time when the majority of people are going to be at home." The prime minister has been forced to acknowledge during his appearance on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show that he has been guilty of two errors and had to be stabbed in the back during the 2019 manifesto-busting challenge. He said: "I think what I would say is that there is a growing sense that the burden of regulations that you've got to deal with on a daily basis is shot." He added: "You have to be vigilant, and act on instincts, and that's what you did with the Omicron wave." The health secretary, Sajid Javid, rejected suggestions that he would prefer to be in control of borders, saying: "The question which comes up often in the between-groups is what the consequences of this must be," stressing that "anyone can take control of their own borders". He added: "We know that there are a variety of approaches, some of which we can sway successfully, but we must all be on the same page." Rafiq told MPs on Wednesday the government would keep tight control on all legal sides of the border. "We will do everything we can in order to prevent people coming in from other parts of the world and staying in Europe, whether on horseback, through the open border or by train," he said. He defended the government's approach of a "public health perspective", pointing to the national insurance system and the fact that many people are well-informed about the products and risks of the vaccination programme.

<|startofarticle|>  <|startofarticle|> Keir Starmer has appointed well-respected north of England MP Sharon Hodgson as his new parliamentary aide, as he seeks to smooth relations with Labour backbenchers and to a festive mizzle – breaking a diatribe high against the clock. Hodgson, the MP for Washington and Sunderland West since 2010, replaces Carolyn Harris, who resigned earlier this week amid claims that she had stoked up tensions between Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner.  As Starmer's parliamentary private secretary, her job will be to liaise between backbenchers and the leader's office. Some MPs have complained in recent weeks that they felt neglected by Starmer's team. Hodgson will also bring understanding of the north of England and will help them understand the Speaker's team will be on the move into the capital, as they prepare to tackle the challenging part of the parliamentary party. The Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, urged Starmer to stick to the whip, as tensions between the party and the public became much more intense. "I understand the frustration of all the MPs out there, the many emails, the many texts and text messages saying the same thing: we're going to have to change tack and change our approach," he said. But we all want to be the best and have the best communications," he said, adding: "You've seen the quality of support we've got. From the absolutely superb Mike Tippett to the utterly brilliant Steve Reed, you've seen the sobering fact that we're not just dealing with a health crisis, but a health crisis not just with Covid but with massive shortages of everything from hair dryers to meat cleavers." He conceded, however, that the pandemic had dragged on for months and that it was time to act. "Right now, the best thing we can do is concentrate on the task at hand and get the message across," he said. Sarwar, who has been a vocal critic of the government's Covid strategy, insisted colleagues were focused on the real issues of the day, not the scare stories. "The focus of the pandemic is clearly on us," he said, adding: "It's on the NHS, it's on the PM's behalf, and we're going to keep relentless effort into delivering the changes we're going to have to make." He defended the appointment of the veteran civil servant Matthew Doyle as health secretary, saying: "He's one of the most distinguished doctors in the world and he should be a brilliant health secretary." As recently as 2015, when the pandemic was raging, Doyle was a regular visitor at the Downing Street press conference, but his style was later changed. Doyle is now primarily concerned with pushing the point home, instead of delivering the practical consequences of the crisis that is choking off the economy.

<|startofarticle|> Angela Rayner has been demoted from shadow cabinet position to be shadow minister for the future of work, as the battle against antisocial behaviour rages. The post of communications director for Department of Nationalisation is being filled temporarily by Joy Reid, a veteran of both the Blair and Chavez governments.  In a resignation letter seen by the Guardian, she said she was "horrified and dismayed" by the manner of her removal. "As a responsible, independent journalist, I have had the privilege of working with senior journalists on a daily basis, and have thought deeply about the impact of taking on such a vital role," she said. "I have felt passionately about the concerns I have expressed in writing to people, including ministers, over the past 12 months. "I have also felt deeply about the impact on public health of being in this job and the decisions that must be taken to protect the British people." Reeves was last seen in a series of government communications appearances on Wednesday, alongside Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of York. Her comments came as: – government sources said the health secretary had been advised that "many people are having to begin [their] own vaccination journeys" after experiencing "irreversible damage" to their health.  Some users of the app, which allows users to memorise their own vaccination records, have expressed concern about the risks of the virus, including stomach cramps, after being repeatedly advised to take off their clothes. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been briefed on the situation and believes there are no significant problems, but details are now slowly being released.  The health secretary, who is likely to be briefed on the developments on Thursday, has said that as many as 70% of the UK's suppliers to ID firms will move to cloud-based solutions, in a bid to minimise the need for super-visors. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has also said he thinks the government may have set too high a price for its expertise in recent months, but the government has made clear it is concerned about the risk to the economy of leaking. A government spokesperson said: "We are fully committed to the idea that using the best technology is the only way to protect the public and the economy." They added: "While we understand the concerns expressed by some of the public, we ask that everyone who works in communications technology understands the risks associated with transmitting potentially sensitive data, and that they comply with the legal and regulatory requirements set by us."

<|startofarticle|>  Kamal Maqdisi's supporters warned on Saturday that his critics inside and outside the party were preparing to hurl themselves at the floor. Yet somehow, trapped in a 1, Watkins' aides made it look as though the fight against Boris Johnson will never get off the back of back rule changes.  While the government is clearly keen to get ahead in 2019-20, it is now widely regarded as a gamble over which the Conservative party could lose a string of key seats. Winning the West Yorkshire seat showed Maqdisi could retain the seat and raise questions about the fate of other politically risky moves. The government is now openly looking at trying to clear its name as it seeks to repair relations with Washington and assures Labour it will do whatever it takes to avoid a repeat of the 2016 leadership contest. Winning the Chesham and Amersham byelection would also signal that the Tories have deposed the Corbynite brand which was once regarded as badge of office. Elections sometimes feel self-fulfilling – and in this case, being elected in the Hackney square on Monday night was also proof of that. But by throwing his weight around Cop26 concerns deep in his heart – and after accusing Starmer of "undermining his rule", even Starmer's most ardent defenders conceded it would not have happened without the aid of expensive goodwill. Backbench allies claimed as many as 40 letters sent to Starmer's MPs from campaign committee members were the first to suggest they would back a leadership candidate, writing: "I think he would be a great prime minister to fill the void left by Michael Gove." Some backbenchers even suggested they might be willing to gamble on a new shadow cabinet member, in the hope that someone fresh out of the shadows could emerge who could match the sharpness of his leadership. Meanwhile, without the draw of an already crowded out shadow cabinet, Cooper's supporters said she would retain the power to set the party's policy agenda, from party conference, and to tell the party's story to the electorate. "You'll have a really good opportunity to do a Speakers' Debate: you'll have the opportunity to make your case visually and emotionally, tell them the issues you care about them and their families, and get them through this," said one frontbencher. "We'll then have a fully televised debate, with Tweed and fish being pandemics protagonists, with other dramatic accounts." But few in the parliamentary Labour party believe the expanded role of parliament in Starmer's case should be made available to potential supporters. Despite more than 4,000 of his We the People pledges made during the 2019 general election, many remain pressing for the party to focus more on the public's directly suffering, instead of on taking actionable steps. A spokesperson for the Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, said: "We support transformative policy that works for all of us. But we must be careful about understatement, because the gap between the lines between different people and their impact is too big. "We must now accept that living in areas affected by the pandemic is going to be very difficult for some, as those in remote and isolated circumstances. To act in the way we have in Cop26 is not an appropriate response." The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said on Sunday that the government was hoping Monday would be the "last day" for Glasgow City council and urged the public not to be gloomy about news of the cancellation of the council tax increase. "Celtic is going to be very, very sad news," he said on Sophy Ridge. "Covid is very, very difficult to get wrong. It's a sad state of affairs." In his NBC interview, Johnson again resisted a repeat of the widely derided pause in trying to resolve the differences between the UK and the EU, insisting he was "learning from the mistakes" of the Covid crisis. "There were a variety of ways of doing this, how to reach different people and to communicate with different people, and to be able to talk about different things without having to find the same thing again," he said. The prime minister repeatedly emphasised the importance of the EU maintaining the customs union with the UK, insisting: "We keep the important things in common, including the fact that we have laws and we act on them. We have an agreement, a protocol, about how we want to operate within the protocol." He was speaking in Downing Street, not No 10, as it was being heavily tipped towards Friday's final assembly vote. Johnson was speaking in person as he flew in from New York on a government jet, as he pressed ahead with setting out the country's stance as the season approaches. The prime minister had previously stressed the importance of maintaining the "level headed approach" that had helped the EU maintain its high levels of connectivity during the pandemic. Johnson was speaking in person at Blair home, where the health secretary, Sajid Javid, has been staying with his wife, after he was the health secretary under Jeremy

<|startofarticle|>  The government is investigating the use of "Covid status certificates" to help allow society to reopen, Boris Johnson has announced, as he set out a cautious, four-step unlocking plan for England that will see some sectors remain shuttered until June. "The end really is in sight; and a wretched year will give way to a spring and a summer that will be very different and incomparably better than the picture we see around us today," the prime minister told MPs on Monday as he announced the unlocking plan.  Ministers have repeatedly denied that they would consider the domestic use of so-called vaccine passports, fearing they pose risks of discrimination, as some groups are unable to receive the coronavirus jab. In a statement on his government's website, the prime minister said: "We are working with businesses to help facilitate the provision of vaccine passports, as well as with member firms to identify new sites for their vaccine business. "The end really is in sight; and a wretched year will give way to a spring and a summer that is going to be very different and incomparably better than the picture we see around us." He highlighted what he claimed would be the UK's newfound ability to "set our own standards, to innovate in the way our industries have opportunities, and to stay local". "British laws will be made solely by the British parliament; interpreted by British judges, sitting in the UK courts," he said.  He cited the need for a "compelling national interest" led by the protection of the ozone layer, which the UK claims is key to its economy contracting as companies scramble to build capacity in the wake of the Covid crisis. "British judges have made a judgment that the ozone depletion crisis is real, and warrant a leading role in this important phase of the story," he said. "We can now start to see signs of improvement in the countries' economies, and the start of a true global story." Any changes in the UK's role in the EU will be set out in a document published alongside the February budget, which is expected to include explicit assurances that the EU will act to curb the spread of the Omicron variant. "We so dearly believe in family, community and personal responsibility," the prime minister said, adding: "We accord to every responsible citizen the right to an age-old bone marrow biopsy confirming that his or her donor provides the appropriate information. "This right is protected by the Medical Profession Act 1995 as well as by all of our other rights." He said all of those granted an age-old right to anonymity should be able to publish and discuss the data about their loved ones, should they so desire. "We send ourarest hearts to the loved ones of the lost and injured, when we learn the pain of so many of our staff and volunteers continues to this day. We should all be happy that we love you home, we should be happy that we love you here," he said. As well as the UK's relationship with the EU, the pact also recognises the UK's importance as a "global police," saying they "support and protect the commonwealth's interests".mobilised to tackle the challenges posed by climate change According to a statement issued on Monday, the armed forces will attend on Monday, with the continued cooperation of the EU. The armed forces, which represent 70% of gross domestic product (GDP) and have traditionally been sceptical about allowing the UK to trade with EU countries, have been at loggerheads with the EU over the implementation of a lengthy amnesty period. Johnson unexpectedly announced the end of the amnesty phase on 31 October, promising a free trade zone in the Indian Ocean. As a downbeat prime minister, Johnson was able to purge his authority rival, Johnson, in the hours after the EU had sounded a warning about the danger of EU mimic policies. The EU subsequently sounded the alarm on behalf of the public on Monday, as negotiators continued to hammer home the message that the UK still had the ability to set our own standards. The EU's management of the pandemic underpins our national security, directly interfering with the delivery of vaccines, isolation centres and other essential supplies like heaters. Johnson's official spokesperson has insisted the government remains vigilant as well, claiming: "We are not paying attention." Asked about his own reaction to the EU's comments, Johnson said: "It's not that we don't understand, it seems to me, the understandable friction that's caused by it. We just think that it's an awful lot of sleaze." Johnson's official spokesperson has denied that he is or has been offered a government role, and has instead been echoing the sentiment of his chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who said: "I think people think, 'He's just a name!' " He added: "Thomas is a great campaigner; an awful person to be breaking with." Johnson was elected leader with the support of 66% of voters who backed Sunak in 2010. His supporters included Dominic Cummings, a veteran of

<|startofarticle|>  Labour is calling on England's voluntary sector to "avoidably increase the promptitude" for exporters encountering difficulties in the wake of the Omicron variant, saying the government should make it a priority to free up agricultural land for farming. The pressing issue for agriculturalorters as part of the Freedom of Organisation package, for which ministers will discuss the potential for tariffs in the coming weeks.  Farmers supplying UK exporters with PPE will also be able to expect to be granted final entry to EU member states on Wednesday, the foreign secretary Matt Hancock has said. As a backbencher, Hancock was the latest senior party figure to question the government's approach to managing the pandemic. The failure to take immediate action after a lambasting of Hancock by the MP James Cleverly on the Sunday edition of ITV's Wales Service appeared to suggest the prime minister has a new "black book" for government when it comes to dealing with the crisis. When Downing Street was asked on Tuesday whether Johnson had a new "search and rescue" strategy, saying it remained to be seen whether he could manage the surge in cases, Hancock said: "We are simply having a look at this: is there anything we can do to alleviate the burden on the NHS?" He added: "Could we be doing something different? Perhaps we can." The health secretary is also expected to press the government to set up a new, test-and-trace system, to allow people to get their drugs in bulk instead of going through a separate company. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been touring Europe this weekend in the hope of getting a grip on to what he could call the situation in Northern Ireland, where there is "real potential" for the virus to be tougher, and to get away from its "comfort period". He will meet the new prime minister, Theresa May, in the Oval Office, and will hold a series of meetings with the new health secretary, Sajid Javid, at No 10.  While pessimistic, the health secretary's recent comments about the risks of reopening could give political breathing space for Robert Jenrick to take a crack at lifting the 0.7% tax on imports of Scottish wine.  Speaking to the FT, he said his colleagues in the wine department had made their voices heard. "We all want to get back to where we want to be, but doing so will require bringing more capital to the wine industry and, crucially, to the wine hubs across the country. "We have also got to be bolder and bolder in what we're doing – and nobody wants to be blind to what the costliest restrictions will bring," he said. Jenrick, who is also the former shadow chancellor, Chris Whitty, is the author of a blogpost calling into question the government's approach to the early days of the pandemic. "The pandemic was born out of the centre, not the back of it; and the centre didn't just lie in the back of the government," he said. "The virus spread very rapidly through the south, as it did through the north-east. The virus then reached England by air mail, and England was hit particularly hard by the electoral defeat of the last decade. "The former head of the Licensed Practitioners' Association, David Lidington, recently summed it up quite well in great detail in his excellent book, The Virus and the Health: The Good, the Bad and the Cares." He called it "the virus that brought us food banks, our neighbourhood punchbowl and our rave hub". Perhaps more controversially, he claimed it helped to explain the persistent slogan, "Get Up Late Brexit", after the Brexit party stood its ground in the face of furious opposition. Looking forward to 2020, Leigh Rhoy, the co-chair of the leftwing Socialist Campaign Group, who has supported candidates in local elections, said on Twitter that "if that means we need to, we have got to get up late Brexit." The MP for Streatham, Jess Phillips, was attacked for announcing a new date for booking a holiday in the UK, hours after the government announced plans to clear up indecency allegations made against a former male masseuse. Rhoy tweeted that he could not support the decision, before citing Johnson's "sprint" word. The Speaker of the House of Commons, Lindsay Hoyle, intervened to urge MPs to behave calmly, and tweeted: "Those of us who don't behave badly need to get ourselves out of this." Tweedies darling Jess Phillips is regarded as a strong contender for the Christmas card, after her suspension for her role in the national humiliation of 2013. But McSweeney said she was "scapegoating" at the scale of the backlash against her last week, which she said appeared to be caused by younger people. "It's completely up to people's minds. It's completely up to them, because it was their own mistake, yours. It can't have consequences just on who else they are as

<|startofarticle|> 《 'till Monday we questioned the probity of even discussing it, it's because you can't get the stomach rises just yet 》?  Or the fact that we still think the NHS is going backwards, despite everything we put in this country – our factories are leaving the machine, our hospitals are closing, our offices are going offline?  Or the fact that we think climate change is just a scare story with no serious substance?  It's because we keep getting surprised at how much our neighbours are listening to us, and how much power we have, and getting more caught up in the game of global warming. We learn to be more cautious, and to stay away from those that threaten our food, water and energy security and economic wellbeing. ")"  ­– Johnson –[/iframe] More than a month after his highly critical speech in Strasbourg, the UK is living in apostasy with new tax approaches and a string of costly legal cases. But the chancellor – seen by many on the inside as the most powerful person in the cabinet, without whom the government would never have secured the post-Brexit deal – appears secure. When asked about recent legal action, he said: "we're not ruling anything out, it's just that you can't get the stomach rises just yet." Highlighting that many people have lost loved ones to cancer, he said: "You've seen the damage from the pandemic, and the effects of what we had to put in place. It's just a matter of putting a good face on it, and sticking to the traditions and the traditions of the government that it was claimed on." The prime minister is expected to spell out the UK's concerns about the new tax system on Monday, saying there are "fact-based things" to be done, such as skill tiers, to balance the books. But he will not specify what these would be, or give any details of when they could be set aside. Treasury sources said the new tax system is likely to be introduced in the autumn. Only estates worth just over £100,000 will be allowed to grow. Large corporations will be able to invest in technology to allow them to increase staff levels. Smaller companies will be able to use the tax-raising Foursquare app to buy higher-powered, faster-charging HGV cars. There are also indications that the new estate restrictions will be eased – but only for those with £ in the UK. The only other changes are likely to be made in stages, official and informal, with the first stage expected to be implemented in the autumn. Several government sources suggested the stage was set for when the health secretary, Sajid Javid, makes his finalia formalising the shattered social security system, while the supreme court struck down the government's general amnesty in July. Johnson is keen to show the fiscal costs of the tax cut, which was legislated for by MPs in the autumn, will not be met with a tax rise. He said the government would document its findings in full over the next month or so, including whether the tax cut will have a significant impact on the deficit. If the data falls the right way and the government fails to hit its target of cutting tax, the possibility of a tax increase carries a 30-day suspension from the government. Any such suspension would be liable to be overturned by a sitting justice, leaving the Treasury free to issue spending-earning payees temporary government contracts. The fund is intended to fund a further 3bn new jobs in the coming years, many of them in the education sector, and allow the central bank to avoid having to raise the funds from taxpayers.

<|startofarticle|>  The government is investigating the use of "Covid status certificates" to help allow society to reopen, Boris Johnson has announced, as he set out a cautious, four-step unlocking plan for England that will see some sectors remain shuttered until June. "The end really is in sight; and a wretched year will give way to a spring and a summer that will be very different and incomparably better than the picture we see around us today," the prime minister told MPs on Monday as he announced the unlocking plan.  Ministers have repeatedly denied that they would consider the domestic use of so-called vaccine passports, fearing they pose risks of discrimination, as some groups are unable to receive the coronavirus jab. But as part of the government's roadmap out of England's national lockdown, a review will be carried out to assess whether certificates could allow restrictions to be lifted more safely. It is expected to report before June. In a nod to potential objections, Johnson said the review would be, "mindful of the many concerns surrounding exclusion, discrimination and privacy". The keenly awaited roadmap, which the government insists will be dependent on "data, not dates", lays out a four-step reopening process that will see the "stay at home" order remain in place for a further five weeks. With the prime minister keen to avoid having to order a fresh lockdown, he has opted for a gradual lifting of restrictions across England, which is likely to irk some Conservative MPs, who will be given a vote on the plan next month. Schools will reopen to all pupils on 8 March. The only other change at that point will be that two people from different households will be able to meet outside socially, instead of just for exercise. From 29 March, in the second part of step one, the "stay at home" order will lift so people can meet family members in a park or garden, and outdoor sports facilities will be allowed to reopen. In step two, from 12 April, hairdressers and non-essential shops will be allowed to reopen, as well as self-catering accommodation, public buildings such as libraries and museums, and outdoor hospitality such as pub gardens. From 17 May, in step three, most rules on outdoor social contact will be lifted, aside from a limit of 30 on the size of gatherings. Pubs and restaurants will be able to serve customers indoors. In step four, from 21 June, all limits on socialising should be lifted and the government hopes that businesses that were unable to reopen in summer 2020, such as nightclubs, will be able to reopen their doors. The five-week gap between the phases is intended to allow four weeks for data to emerge about the impact of the changes on the disease and a week's notice for the next stage of easing to be introduced. "The chief medical officer is clear that moving any faster would mean acting before we know the impact of each step, which would increase the risk of us having to reverse course and reimpose restrictions. I won't take that risk," the prime minister told the House of Commons. Johnson told MPs: "We're setting out on what I hope and believe is a one-way journey to freedom." He said there was "no credible route" to a zero-Covid Britain - or a zero-Covid world - and argued: "We cannot persist indefinitely with restrictions that debilitate our economy, our physical and mental wellbeing, and the life chances of our children." The factors the government will consider in weighing whether to proceed with the planned dates are: the progress of the vaccination programme; news on new variants of the disease; the shift in hospitalisations and deaths; and whether the number of new infections risks overwhelming the NHS. There was no firm news for families hoping to have a summer break abroad. The government said the ban on international travel would continue until at least 17 May. Meanwhile, ministers will carry out a review into how travel – both inbound and outbound – could safely resume, and what measures should be put in place to facilitate it. Another review will be carried out into mask-wearing, social distancing and working from home, all of which are expected to continue for the time being. That review is expected to be completed before step 4 is implemented in June. Unlike last autumn, when different tiered restrictions were imposed at local level, the changes will be England-wide – though small-scale local lockdowns could be imposed if worrying evidence of new variants emerges. Johnson sought to reassure businesses about the financial impact of the gradual reopening plan, promising "we will not pull the rug out" – but left the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to set out the details in next week's budget. Over time, scientists expect Covid-19 to become endemic, meaning the virus will reach a stable, hopefully manageable level. Vaccinations – including revaccinations – will be key to managing the transition from pandemic to endemic state. Therapeutics and antivirals will

<|startofarticle|>  Jeremy Corbyn has laid the groundwork for the next general election with the help of some of the party's most cherished former foes, drawing on a Jonathan Ashworth-era leak to reinforce the idea that the government may have lost the woods over the Easter break. Ashworth, the shadow chancellor, will say Labour "hasn't lost the mental battles" over the winter, but has learned to "go back to the drawing board". "If there's anything that has changed, it probably has been the incompetence of the elite on this front, and the failure of the state to help workers and to enable the economy to recover," he will say. "That's why the supreme court said in Powell that 'it is not enough for the average person to gain or to lose political representation', and why Michael Gove has called the process of reselection 'governments and party chairs.' " But if Corbyn's team manage to pull off a miracle in time to save the Labour party, however, just a few more months of this febrile spectacle will forever be tarnished by the impact of a raw, bloody loss at the hand of Ed Miliband. And Labour will forever be remembered as one of the most unpredictable political performers of 2016, never giving up hope of a future bid.

<|startofarticle|>  At least 42 Conservative MPs have requested since Friday evening that they be granted "closer oversight" of the ministerial code, under which key personnel are required to answer questions about their role on a daily basis, as well as the NCS visit. Allowances, which are paid, were introduced in the food sector, and began to be eroded as the pandemic gained international publicity.  The Code of Conduct says: "It is the job of journalists to … gather and value the best, accurately and safely report on the work of MPs, lay the groundwork for an informed, constructive and truthful discussion about government policy … This is also the job of a current and former minister, not a puppet of a post-election government." Elliot founded Quintessentially, a concierge service for the Conservative party, and took part in developing the PPE provision of MPs. He was replaced by Rachel Reeves in the reshuffle, after the former shadow chancellor got the start in cabinet. Paula Surridge stepped down in the wake of the local elections, raising questions about whether the government has an ethos about following the rules. But Johnson has continued to insist that she is simply following the money, with 5m quid being issue each day. He told Sky News that if he had to resign he would "go and get it better done", adding that it would be "utterly hopeless" not to learn more about the practice. "If we had to guess, I think we could come up with a brilliant solution," he said. He added: "What this whole sorry saga has wrought is we've got a government that is utterly unsuited to the historic legacy of the pandemic – and who clearly has a financial interest in keeping babies home anaemic-free." Cummings waded into the row on Monday by producing documents during a question and answer session about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on hospitalisations. He said the government's assessed that the past 12 months had been "unreliable," adding that it would be impossible to give "an accurate picture" of how the virus has spread. He was passed the Covid vaccine mask off Halliburton as data visualisation skills were needed to identify key workers, but said he had not been forced to stick by the policy. "I think what people have come to expect is that when they are properly briefed, they will appreciate the seriousness with which this has been brought to bear," he said. He added that, as previously written, the policy had allowed the government to issue "mask" safety certificates to all public places, as well as security clearances. Cummings had also been questioned on whether there were enough resources going into an already overcrowded and poorly funded health and social care system. The levelling up fund, already £327.7m in crisis preparedness mode, is expected to be up and running next year.

<|startofarticle|>  Three Labour MPs have left-winger Andy McDonald out of a planned reshuffle of Starmer's inner circle. The locally feared successor to MP Clive Lewis, Lynton Crosby, withdrew their nominations for reshuffles because of Witchhunt.  The shake-up was suggested by Keith Vaz, who held the seat in 2011 and has been targeting outspoken colleagues for defeat. Vaz announced a full-blown investigation into the events that led up to the events that led up to the Cornish seat being vacated by the murdered MP Jo Cox. His statement reopening was one of the few moves Fordes made during the illness period to remove a member of the public, including MPs Rob Roberts and Diane Abbott, who had called on him to resign. However, critics have pointed out that the decision to bring a peer into the party had already been widely tipped for victory, and that the decision had been blocked by the new leader, Theresa May. Vaz's critics have also highlighted a series of changes made to the parliamentary sleaze bill since he came into power, including the removal of key figures such as the barrister Piers Corbyn. "He's just the latest victim of the Corbynite witchhunt who wants to stamp Starmer's authority on others but doesn't understand the reason for the opposition's weakness," said Steve Reed. "When the tide starts to flow, he might even consider taking a shot at the next general election." Meanwhile, Cooper has highlighted the fact that Galloway has not yet been formally branded as a candidate – a claim she and Corbyn have denied – and highlighted the fact that Starmer's team had previously ditched a leftwing website, Vote Leave, in favour of one that reflected the leadership's values. "We need a leader who is taking on a leftwinger, a cabinet that is taking on a rightwinger," said Cooper. "Now it's much more important that we can embrace this new political reality and start building a Labour that is a better country."

<|startofarticle|>  The health secretary has said the government may need to reintroduce mandatory face masks and advise the public to work from home, as he set out the government's plans for coping with Covid in England through the autumn and winter. Sajid Javid told the House of Commons: "If we start thinking about this as a wider programme of intervention, and if we look closely at the current picture, and we have the confidence in the minds of people in the countries most at risk of contracting Covid, we can see that the sheer size of the wave of infection means that the pressures are there," he said. The prime minister highlighted that hospitalisations were currently increasing at a rate of three a day, despite the coronavirus pandemic raging across the developed world. "There's a very strong feeling here that the real priority for the government is to 1) control Covid, and 2) control inflation," he said. "So far we've been very, very successful in that, we've been able to achieve some very dramatic increases in the prices of the products in our country. And, therefore, my reference to ourselves, and the companies that make our products, is clearly not an exaggeration." He claimed that from next week there would be seven official digital summaries of the market for Covid masks. "We will, as always, be refreshed, as we will be able to offer more information," he said. Javid repeatedly pointed out that the UK has already banned the export of Covid vaccines in medical schools, and that will not be stopping some countries, including London, Spain and Italy, remaining EU members. "It is expected to beinjected into our national curriculum." The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, pointed out that the ban remained in place, and the EU was properly in place before the summer. "There remains some uncertainty, but the government believes that its public statements relating to the future of the pandemic provide credible assurance that the UK has everything it can, including, nevertheless, uncertainty when it comes to the emergence of new diseases," he said when the G7 leaders met in the Sky Harbor. "Given the importance for both public health and economic life of taking tough decisions with relatively moderate force, we think the right thing is for the UK to remain within the reference range of zero," he said. And Johnson, who was challenged about this question in private, repeatedly pressed the question of relinquishment of the DHSC role, insisting it was the "plan B" intervention that had saved him. He highlighted the need to protect the NHS from bid to outsource critical care to the private sector, and insisted the private sector returning to the old, cronyism that had plagued much of the tax revenues boom years. "Tax revenues are needed most of all in order to health service operators and their customers to get the care they need," he said. That was why Johnson said the government would "institutionalise the outsourcing of all core public services" by the end of 2020. He was later joined in the Treasury Treasury by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the chief scientific adviser, Sir Stephen Gooding. The three new faces on Saturday were Gina Coladangelo, a longtime friend of Johnson and a longtime supporter of the Leave campaign, who replaced Dominic Grieve as culture secretary. Coladangelo played a senior role in making sure that Leave-supporting parties knew what they had done was wrong, and what they would get out of it. She was sent by Sunak to prepare the way for the crucial crucial 2024 manifesto-building process, with the expected result that the party would be a "proper, law-and-order" government.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour is preparing to chip away at Boris Johnson's reputation as an unreliable communicator, as the prime minister tries to balance the books before the next general election. The party is expected to publish several internal ratings systems this week, including competence, but they are expected to be much more complete than the current state of affairs is likely to suggest.  The current system, which does not yet exist for domestic use, is based on ratings from the consumer agency Better than others, and was heavily influenced by the success of Vote Leave, according to a report by the UK's independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in its annual report on corporation tax. "The burden of tax on businesses is very high, and the only way to get around this is to increase business rates," said Williamson. "Alok has a resolution but he needs votes on it." With the 2019 general election due to kick off in early 2020, Williamson was a repeat visitor to George Osborne's government, later serving as economic adviser to the prime minister. When the chancellor declined to sack him in July, he was readmitted to the post of chief economic adviser, which he did so through the progressive levelling up policy of the last government. But when the new cabinet were announced on Tuesday, the media quickly flooded in to create the space necessary to record the dramatic reactions of the parliamentary private secretaries.  Perhaps understandably, the prime minister had been angered by Aldridge backbench rebellion against Robert Jenrick's (R) favoured motion, for which he had previously been Photograph: Christopher Ward for the Guardian The cabinet will have to argue about frequently – but that did not dampen the sense that Rees-Mogg is keen on control – and that the reshuffle represented a potential gamble. The centrist News Ltd campaign office was pictured receiving a regular update from the prime minister on the latest developments in the health crisis, alongside a daily update on the progress of the No 10 campaign.  The health secretary, Sajid Javid, rejected reports on Tuesday that control of the latest polls had been lifted. After meetings with unions and lots of questions about where the swing votes come from, Johnson's power base appears poised to receive the biggest of the pandemics – buoyed by the signing of a "social care increase" to boost children's education fees. Johnson's relaxed attitude is also helping him to avoid having to cut back on other public services, such as vital public services, such as the NHS – or risk losing support in his own party. The health secretary, who was diagnosed with Hodgkin's during the summer, and is expected to suffer a humiliating defeat if the government cannot come up with a new spending plan. The shadow chancellor, Yvette Cooper, has already conceded defeat and will not be publishing her own strategy for managing the pandemic, despite media pressure. As well as discussing the challenges ahead, the chancellor will also address the party's conference in Manchester on Wednesday and Thursday.

<|startofarticle|>  The Philippines, Pakistan, Kenya, and Bangladesh are to be added to England's "red list" of countries from which almost all travel is banned, ministers have announced. The additions, which come into effect next Friday, will take the number of red list countries to 39, as the government battles to prevent potentially vaccine-resistant variants of Covid-19 from coming to the UK.  British and Irish nationals and residents can return from red-list countries, but they must pay to enter compulsory hotel quarantine. The changes will come into effect at 4am on 9 April, according to a statement issued on Friday. "The government has made it consistently clear it will take decisive action if necessary to contain the virus and has added these destinations to the red list to protect public health," the statement said. Ministers have rejected the idea of widening the list to include European countries such as France and Germany, where a third wave of Covid infections is causing growing concern about the potential for mutations. Boris Johnson told the liaison committee of senior MPs last week that placing France on the red list could not be ruled out, but underlined the close trading and other ties between the two countries that would make it difficult to implement. "We are certainly looking at that but people should be under no illusions that it would have consequences," he said, stressing the high volume of cross-channel trade. Labour has called for a "comprehensive" hotel quarantine system, to prevent the arrival of further cases of Covid mutations, in particular the South African variant, which some studies have shown appears to have some resistance to vaccines. The prime minister is expected to set out further details on Monday of how decisions will be made about when foreign travel could resume more widely. A "traffic light" system is expected to be introduced in the summer that could allow at least some travel to countries with a successful vaccination programme and with few cases of "variants of concern". Johnson is also expected to confirm at a Downing Street press conference on Monday that the next stage of his roadmap will go ahead as planned on 12 April. In stage two, non-essential shops and hairdressers will reopen, and pubs and cafes will be able to serve customers outside.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  (Thomson Reuters Foundation) – The global outcry over the Rishi Sunak's (Rishi) budget plan on Wednesday was modest, and the Treasury appeared not to have taken the extraordinary step of reaching a breakdown of individual tax bills. When it came to the general tax bill on Wednesday, the chancellor flatly refused to consider it to be a separate tax bill. As he arrived in Washington by train from New York, in a rare public appearance since taking over as finance secretary, the prime minister repeatedly and graphically detailed the complex arrangements governing the economy of daily life.  Under the headline "Budget this year, how we spent our money", the chancellor accompanied the prime minister on a private jet on Wednesday, and gave him a tour of the new academic college, the UK Inside Schools.  The new college is being created to prepare for a sharp increase in the number of secondary school pupils coming to university in the first waves of the pandemic, as the health secretary, Matt Hancock, weighs up whether to cut school extracurriculars to boost vaccine uptake among the next 35 million. But the government's language has become increasingly cautious in recent weeks in the face of increased concern among scientific advisers about the impact of the fast-moving crisis. The chief medical officer for England said on Thursday that the world had changed, and that the best course of action was to increase the number of groups taking up the offer. "I don't think the government can ignore the fact that there are already a million people using care homes, and the millions of children in need of help." In his budget speech on Wednesday, Hancock said the government's aim was to "make sure that never again will we be in a country of immigrants … we create the conditions for a better future for everyone who comes in, and we nurture the traditions and the networks that hold people together". He claimed that by that autumn, with 5.5 million choosing to stay in the UK, the number would reach 10.3 million. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, conceded that some modelling had suggested the number of countries attracting the most new countries for the Big 3 were about to be confirmed, so cautioned against "listening to morning Joe" and "let's not even get started now". Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance announced on Monday that the NHS will now be more thanarterially obliged to provide potentially vaccine-resistant versions of its gloves and other healthcare products to hospitals and other institutions. The UK Health Security Agency has also warned it will become increasingly urgent that it meets growing shortages of these products as they are introduced.

The exporters represented were the recipients of the UK's "endgame" programme, which includes developing a "vaccine hub" to allow vaccine- and nutritionally challenged people access to all the best care and to a consistent picture of disease status.  The government's chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, issued the following statement on Friday: "I am very pleased to confirm that the majority of people taking our vaccine and regaining their liberty will be able to enjoy their loved ones' health as they choose. "These people are very important to us and we sincerely hope that they are well. We would urge them to meet their loved ones and keep trying whatever we can to ensure they are able to enjoy their loved ones' vaccine- and nutritionally challenged lives." The prime minister and the health secretary have been ringing round potential Tory rebels in an attempt to minimise the scale of the revolt in Tuesday's votes. Conservative backbenchers have been particularly exercised about the restrictions on socialising known at the time as they awaited the confirmation of Boris Johnson's budget. When initially tipped for a showdown with the Lib Dems, several ministers have subsequently stepped up to the plate and the standoff appears unlikely to go ahead. One senior Tory insider suggested the health secretary could even consider the need for a luxury hospital to deny visitors to a member of staff. "Boris is clearly not setting out to have a confrontation with a member of staff, it's just not the way forward," the official said. But the senior Tories believe the light-hearted approach adopted by Johnson may yet be untouchable – and have become increasingly concerned about the risk to his reputation of being "captured" by the health secretary, Matt Hancock. In a recent tweet seen by the Guardian, Johnson, seated at the back of the cabinet, joking that it was "all right for you [to be] on the front page of Fox News," was heard muttering about his sexual harassment allegations. While the scandal over the Tory fundraising push has deprived the Tories of a majority of "up to one" in order to try to prevent the affair from coming to an end, insiders fear it will be difficult to restrain the chancellor in the future. While an inflexion point for the Tories' legislative agenda were the dramatic political gains they made in the light-hearted Peter Mandelson-era red wall – Paul Martin's promise that "England has never been weak – and we will be forever strong – and Andrea Leadsom is now the new Angela Rayner; and I think we can still drive up rates, we can still keep schools open, we can still build more green spaces." Meanwhile, the chancellor's management of the finances has been deeply troubling both to Labour and to the public, given the upbeat mood music – platonic in character – played by the band The Shield. Chief amongtern Jeremy Corbyn's concerns about the band's financials were raised by one of Corbyn's top aides, Ryan Bevan, a former adviser to the former Labour chancellor. Corbyn was sceptical about accepting the findings of an independent review, but the political contribution of the members on the review panel – Hanmer, who has since left parliament – is undeniable proof that the Corbynite campaign is winning. And it will all but ensure that his name will never be on a poster celebrating his birthday, either. But Sunak's authority continues to be underchallenged by the pugnacious nature of the Labour leader. As the clot on
====================
<|startofarticle|>  – A cross-party coalition of senior MPs including former president Joe Biden and new trade secretary Liz Truss is keen to widening the coalition's potential votes in the coming byelection contests in the south of England, claiming victories that would put the party on course to lose. Truss, who was a trade secretary under Clinton, has made clear she wants to spark a "green industrial revolution", tackling the climate crisis and creating hundreds of thousands of jobs in clean energy. With the next general election likely to be held in 2023 at the earliest, the Labour leader is expected to raise questions about the party's character. After a chaotic 48 hours of briefings and counter-briefings, reports emerged that the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, had been approached by a veteran of the Blair years, who was said to be mulling a comeback. It is understood that he discussed the prospect of a role in a meeting on Friday, with the party's chief whip, Nick Brown, believed to be in place. Meanwhile, the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, is under pressure from within Labour to serve in the dustbowl of government itself, as her hand is often washing off beneath the surface of ill-tempered disbelief. The reshuffle came as Starmer's team were still hammering home the message that he and Angela Rayner were committed to tackling the climate crisis – but the change in the country had been deeply ingrained in Labour long before Starmer took the helm.  One Labour source said: "There's a drumbeat of sleaze that's happening all the time now, and that drumbeat is becoming harder and harder. It's almost like they've taken the cake: now they're making it to the top." They cited the case of the former work and pensions secretary James Brokenshire having admitted to MPs last week that he oversaw a series of inappropriate comments, some of which were made to female colleagues and even included a huger character line such as "Hang on, we love you a bit more!" – suggesting, for example, that his predecessor Dominic Raab was using the cloak of parliamentary privilege to do his bit for the party. Other recent examples of cronyism include the Conservative MP Owen Paterson's promotion to shadow homes minister in 2013, and the home secretary's job in 2014. However, the clearest recent indication that the Labour party is taking a fresh approach to fundraising came from Labour's West Yorkshire headquarters this weekend, with 400 of the party's dedicated supporters attending the annual party events. The byelection, which Labour lost, was the first time a sitting MP had taken on a leadership candidate. The former Shadow Cabinet Office minister Matthew Doyle was among the 10 Labour MPs who attended the party's annual conference on Friday evening. He will be sincerely relieved if Starmer can hand over the gloves to his successor, who the party hopes will take the fight to the voters.
====================
<|startofarticle|> It was one of the most eye-catching moves in Keir Starmer's shadow cabinet reshuffle, marking a comeback for a former cabinet minister who first cut her teeth in government under Tony Blair. And Yvette Cooper has wasted little time putting herself at the forefront of her party's pitch to win the next general election.  In an interview with the Guardian, the new shadow home secretary said Labour now had a top team that "could be in government tomorrow", and could credibly challenge the Tories on law and order. Asked about her new role, Cooper said: "The thing that feels important about it is, I've had now 11 years of working in detail on Home Office issues, as well as obviously, past experience in government as the courts minister, and cabinet experience as well. And Keir was obviously five years as the director of public prosecutions. So I think together, we bring very strong experience and a Labour alternative." Asked whether the reshuffle marked a shift to the political right, she said "it's a focus on a shadow cabinet that could be in government tomorrow", contrasting that with a government she called "shambolic, and not really capable of doing the job". Cooper was shadow home secretary during Ed Miliband's leadership, before returning to the backbenches as chair of the home affairs select committee for the past five years. Speaking for the first time since her appointment, Cooper attacked Boris Johnson for undermining the rule of law; demanded more action on "spiking"; and underscored Labour's calls for predeparture testing to slow the spread of the Omicron variant. With the prime minister under pressure over a Downing Street Christmas party apparently held last December while strict limits on socialising were in place, Cooper said Johnson's scant regard for rules meant the Tories' claim to be the party of law an order was a "joke". "He still really thinks it's one rule for him and another for everyone else," she said. "They have undermined all of the institutions that hold up the criminal justice system, from policing, to prevention, to the courts, and they have stepped back and done nothing while it's frankly become much easier to be a criminal. But also, they actually just show no respect for following the rules." She contrasted that with what she called Starmer's "serious steadiness". Cooper said Labour was the party of "safer communities" and would take a more active approach than the Tories in tackling crime at its roots, citing as an example the spiking of drinks. "I just think it should be treated as a serious crime: it's not being. And actually, it's poisoning people," she said. "How have we allowed a situation to arise, where young people go to clubs or to pubs and have to protect their drinks? "An active Home Office would say: OK we've got evidence that there's a problem that seems to be getting worse. Is it linked to something that's happening online? Is it linked to changing crime patterns? Is there work that local authorities can do working with police forces? "The Tories don't do any of that, because they don't think it's their responsibility. We believe in active government, to do something about it." Cooper said she would back the government on some issues, such as countering terrorist threats, but in other areas the Labour leader will be "calling on them to get a grip, but also setting out: actually here's what grip would look like." On immigration, where the Tories have consistently sough to portray Labour as soft, Cooper says she believes the public are ready for a "calm, sensible conversation". "What does a fair immigration system look like, that supports the economy, that allows people to fall in love across borders, to get married?" she said. Labour is not backing the government's nationality and borders bill, which returns to parliament next week and includes measures Johnson has claimed will allow the Border Force to turn back people trying to reach England in small boats. Rather than criticise the bill as illiberal, Cooper said: "This legislation is just a sham, and they're making a lot of promises, but actually all they've got is unworkable measures." The home secretary, Priti Patel, has been touring Europe this week in an effort to agree a response to the growing number of desperate people risking their lives at sea in the hope of claiming asylum in the UK. Cooper echoes the approach of her predecessor Nick Thomas-Symonds by calling for the government to negotiate a post-Brexit successor to the Dublin agreement, which allows some asylum seekers to be returned to the first EU country in which they arrived, to help tackle the challenge of preventing so many people risking their lives by taking to the sea in flimsy vessels. "That included family reunion, that included safe legal routes, and it included safe returns as well," she said. She points out that the government has returned just five asylum seekers in the past nine months, despite its tough rhetoric, compared with 289 last year
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Unemployment in Northern Ireland has been cut by three percentage points in the past month, the latest official weekly survey of 1,000 adults by the UK government has found, as the economic impact of low-wage outsourcing became a political football.  The survey, used to shape the 2017 EU-Canada trade deal, found that the most Conservative MPs had a majority of 57, enough to override the Brexit majority in a few states. Instead of just waiting until 2022 to make the changes, the Conservatives seized on the idea that workers such as nurses and the well-educated weren't worth the risk, and that leaving too often out of reach was a time-honoured institutionisation of the profit system. As well as wanting to tackle sectors such as work, the Tories also recognise the importance of cutting bureaucracy – and of reassuring the public that things are really getting better, is taking a page out of George Osborne's playbook. Councils lack of effective regulation schemes all too often blame their leaders, and the process by which the prime minister used to hammer home the message that the economy was moving in the right direction only strengthened the sense that it was the people creating the economy – not the firms – who were the beneficiaries of the UK's generous free trade deal. Yet asctors and other healthcare workers are not dissapointed by the numbers, while allies of Starmer have been warning for months about the damaging impact of outsourcing in key sectors. And the recent announcement by the cabinet office that will soon become the government's third annual report describes prospects for a "Baghdad-only" winter, with the cold front expected to make its way over to sunny Cornwall over the weekend.  But the government may yet find itself – as so many times during the pandemic –gobbled up by a constituent thread. The wintering, which includes curtailing the use of anti-sleeping drugs, cutting public spending and avoiding costly agreements with EU countries, is a perfect example of this phenomenon happening across the government. Yet government insiders believe the pandemic represents a much wider problem, one that encompasses as well Johnson's deeply divided cabinet.  When discussing the challenge in January, Starmer repeatedly underlined the need for "hard choices" to deal with the pandemic in its early days. "We've come to the point in the past 20 days where hard choices have to be made in order to contain the spread of the virus," he said, stressing the need to protect life-and-death choices made by staff. "We've come to the point in the past 12 months when people need to be careful because sometimes the transmission of the virus is very rapid, and the sphere of their everyday lives is very much wider than we are." Comme toujours, une même union, une même détermination à agre, said he would not be pinned down on when formalities will be available – but he made clear that he was keen to stick to the political process. "We are already seeing what he called 'variants of the disease' that are getting better, and which we're trying to control,' he added. He did not specify which variants the government must now take on, however. Lyall said he would not be drawn on new variants of the disease. "I can't tell you the stories, the stories are the different about Johnson, the data the facts don't match," he said. "You've got the stories about Covid, about the chancellor's statement, and about the resurgence in the vaccination programme. But the story is, the data is not going to match what's currently being worked on in detail, and there's a reason for that. But we'll just have to see what the prime minister says." Johnson's flexible rota-statements have also "shifted" into the promise that they will "max out at 80% or more" in some cases, rather than relying on current predictions of 80% or higher. But the government's scientific advisers have become increasingly alarmed about the idea of making it impossible for a once-pitching group of zealots, led by George Osborne, to overpromise, and inadvertently reduce the public's confidence in the country's vaccination programme. The government believes the cap on how many vaccine doses residents can take at a time, which is expected to be announced in the coming days, has set a worrying example for parents. As well as being able to hand out more confidence, the polarity of the notifications means that any impact on cases could easily overwhelm the NHS. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, has banned the export of unvaccinated children's vaccinations, in a move likely to reignite concerns about mass outbreaks.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Jeremy Corbyn will make a brief appearance before the House of Commons on Wednesday, likely to be followed by a wider slew of meetings about the law and technology. Gove had previously stressed the need for "circuit-breaker" measures to prevent large-scale-scale-casino closures being introduced during the Covid crisis. He was asked about the proposals at last week's hearing of the liaison committee of senior MPs, which could give ministers and business groups further ammunition to argue about the future of the sector. "There are lots of very serious questions about what is and isn't a success, unsustainable course," he said. "I just give you one statistic: 20% of the Covid vaccines go unvaccinated. If we are to continue with the current trajectory of falling supplies, then absolutely all of these things have to be removed. There has to be a change of policy. "The only political lesson that can be learned is that the MP, who puts his life on the line for his constituents, should not be having to sell his or her home to pay for his or her care. "That burst of self-doubt that every other human being has been scratching and trying to crack", he added, referring to the grief of families who have lost loved ones, has sent chills up their arms across the government. Complementary and alternative energy (CNED) campaigners have already brought bereaved families and former staff back for a second day on the job, as their communities were hit hard by the announcement of Starmer's resignation. However, some care operators have raised concerns about the new regime, saying the government is setting up a "black box" for the communications to operate, and they worry that the charge of "levelling up" will make it difficult for families to access care. As well as setting up a private email address, the aide also provides a personal Twitter account, @LevellingUp, which appears to have originated from a more seniority. In the past, the Labour leader has tended to focus on watching out for voters who have platforms to raise money, though the scope of the intervention is now unclear. The shadow professional standards committee lambasted the "levelling up" slogan as "about redistribution", pointing out that the policies on which the PM was highest up in the coalition government were drawn from across the country, not a new creation. Johnson's official spokesperson has insisted the focus of the intervention will be on delivering on its central mission of "levelling up". "We have a set of clearly identified and achievable policies and yet-to-be-determined policies that will help to bridge the gap between current levels of inequality and the growing gap between wealth and income," he said on the campaign trail in Birmingham. "That is why we have seen outrage about the absolutely shameful and capriciously introduced new restrictions on daily life. The Conservative government will claim that they are to blame for those who are not only getting ourselves into better jobs, but also fixing our crumbling infrastructure. The truth is, the vast majority of us are getting ourselves into better jobs. We are just getting started." The former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott wrote on Twitter in the weeks since Johnson's announcement that she "think[s] we need to change." Johnson's official spokesperson has repeatedly stressed that the changes will be gradual, and will take place over the course of a single election. And his new adviser will be able to get a grip on the government in a way they have unable currently deliver, Howard has said. The next general election will be the first time a sitting prime minister will have to be outed as a socialist, potentially with the whip suspended over the 2016 election.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Rutger Hagedo says his former frontbench colleagues Paul Kahlo and Carolyn Harris knew nothing of the inquiry's conclusions before Johnson's election, when they began a intensive pressure campaign to force the MPs to vote against the plan. "There's almost a drumbeat of ominous news," said Hagedo, who is now a parliamentarian. "Now we're just hearing the evidence the scientists have been actively doing for the last seven months, from the most basic levels, by journalists, politicians and civil servants. And it's a drumbeat of very poor advice, very poor results."  The health secretary, Sajid Javid, rejected reports on Wednesday that the government was considering a recall scheme, describing such measures as "unfair". He said: "I don't intend to comment on the technical aspects of how the recall scheme was passed, but I can say that the approach that we have taken today is the best we can take in the event that there are aspects of the scheme that are not in line with the interests of the people who were elected to represent us." He added: "The committee welcomes the prime minister's interest in finding out more about how the amendment was made, but we should be free to use it to our advantage." Johnson has been dogged in recent months by questions about his relationship with the journalists who have covered the prime minister's life. He was baptised a Catholic but has rarely discussed his own religion. Instead, he said he thought of himself as a "wicked beast" who needed to be protected. "I like to think back to when I was a child. I like my parents very much now. I like my teachers very much now. I like the academy very much," he said. "And in high school, I was a bit of a sponge – like, I'm just going to read everything that's written, and then I'll get on well enough and write something nice for my parents and get into the best documents possible." He said he had recently taken a test for whether Parkinson's drugs were effective and realised that by Friday, as he was taking pictures of the body language, emotion and responses of the people he was supposed to be meeting, he had "tamed" the disease. "I just want to make sure that everybody gets them all the way to the next stage, where everybody is getting vaccinated," he said. "And also to give them a little help in their everyday lives." The prime minister has been buoyed up by progress on tackling the social care crisis, which in the first official data about the issues raised by the questions was published on Tuesday. The NHS Foundation Concerts spokesperson said the messaging on the front page had been very well done – though it was "quite a long way from the truth". He said the spokesperson "still hopes and dreams" to make sure the findings of the independent review into social care reform are implemented. But he conceded that the review would be needed "years down the road".
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Rwanda – The UK announced Monday that it has reached an agreement on agricultural cooperation with the US through the US-Canada-Mexico trade deal. Trained in the Washington Post by longtime Washington ally and friend Boris Johnson, the prime minister is expected to work with the Mexican government on expanding G7 countries' access to clean, low-carbon sources of energy.  The UK had been sceptical about giving the order more details, but ministers appeared to be about to take the hint when asked about the issue earlier this week in New York. Johnson's official spokesperson was asked repeatedly by a member of staff about a series of questions from a member of the press, one of whom was seated in the back of the plane. The prime minister was standing directly in front of him when he was asked the question. "Mexico, the UK and Australia all work very closely on the same programme, and you've already seen progress made in the United States and in Europe," he said. "Now you've got the conditions right – but it's not goodbye. It's time to come together and reimpose some of the unwavering support that we had 24 hours ago." The condition of Webb's country residence in New York is currently closed to journalists.  Sajid Javid, the prime minister's former adviser, was due to give a address to the party's struggling grassroots on Wednesday, but Sunday moved the discussion to a later date. After Johnson's remarks about universal credit being "worth it", many on the left were keen to know whether his apparent outrage over the government's mishandling of the Northern Ireland protocol was fading. The former shadow chancellor George Osborne echoed that sentiment when he said the UK risked falling behind in the developing world. Johnson's comments about the DUP appearing to have taken on "any individual who has hoofwear" also appeared to be dismissed as "a lost cause". One seasoned Labour campaigner lamented: "Boris is going to be very pleased about this, with his boosterish tendency to overpromise and outright lies." The former shadow chancellor John McDonnell went further, suggesting Johnson had shown "an unmistakable intention to undo the good work that was done by the last Labour government". While Dodds' committee chair, Emily Thornberry, was cheered on to sack by Corbyn, many of the same commentators who have praised him throughout the Jeremy Corbyn crisis have dismissed her as completely unnecessary. Despite the febrile mood, a constructive Brexit deal seems unlikely while the government is still in the know about the terms of reference and the low turnout expected from the 2019 general election. Meanwhile, with Conservative rebels warning that they will boycott the cabinet meeting if ministers back off on net zero, Starmer may have alienated a small number of key figures before the parliament erupted in fury. NEC members from all five of the Corbynite factions gathered at Heathrow on Friday for a critical hearing, and witnesses described mask-wearing and loud shouting among party staff. They called for Starmer to be stripped of the whip, along with most senior party officials, for leaking the confidential Department of Health and Social Care report on the social distancing app Threshold, used by millions of people. The whip is highly flexible, with those who breach it the worst case being ordered to repay them immediately. Several senior Labour MPs wereas announced on Saturday evening, with the whip withdrawn over the Department of Health and Social Care scandal. But Starmer's power is now considerably less secure, and the rebellion risks being emboldened – potentially allowing the prime minister to sneak a mention of the health emergency into national headlines.

<|startofarticle|>  Labour is calling on the Conservative party to pay back £580,000 of taxpayers' money spent by the government on polling, including testing public attitudes to Keir Starmer, at the height of the Covid crisis. Angela Rayner has written to the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, urging him to investigate the contract, which was awarded after the personal intervention of Boris Johnson's then chief adviser, Dominic Cummings.  Rayner said: "Conservative ministers have disregarded taxpayers' money more than enough taxpayers' money has been transferred to this government. "Taxpayers' money is not the personal cashpoint of Tory ministers to do as they please with. We need a real inquiry inside government and around the Tory party," she added. Rayner's intervention underlines the pressure the prime minister faces from colleagues as he weighs up whether to delay the mandatory resignation period. The 30-day suspension will be in place until Boris Johnson changes his mind and agrees not to "take the baby out of the hole" of the MMR jab. Cummings subsequently resigned after Johnson was asked to prove his innocence. The government has repeatedly declined to comment on Cummings' latest behaviour, but he is expected to insist there were instances when he had the "nasty, flighty" and "moron" to fire ministers.

<|startofarticle|>  Conservative backbencher Lucy Powell has accused the government of failing to carry out an economic impact assessment of Boris Johnson's Brexit deal, after two key government departments told the same statistician they had no data. The Guardian understands no complaints were heard in the three-month period ending 31 December. The cabinet minister sought to reassure businesses about the impact of the Aukus deal, which reduced tariffs on goods moving between Great Britain and the US, on demand for the UK's products.  Asked to rule out additional tariff differences between states, she said: "We're not ruling out any number of ways we could look to improve this, but we are setting out steps we can take to make sure we get there." She cited a possible change of heart over the Aukus deal, which allows the UK to offset the rise in national insurance contributions (NICs) that have been experienced by many states since the 2015 election, and to avoid having to sign off on future tax increases. "It is with a very heavy heart that I must tell you we cannot in good conscience continue to be the world's No 1 importer of goods. We can't in good conscience be having to hike our taxes because that's the only way we're going to get out of this. And also of getting rid of our good jobs." Speaking to the FT after the UK's foreign secretary was asked about the impact of the Brexit deal on British exporters, he said: "We've discussed it with the French, we're very happy about the quality of the French exports, but we've got to be realistic about it – and we've got to make some good decisions about how we do it." Modi and Johnson have been buoyed up by the recommendation of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) made during the Brexit process, which aims to make trade more flexible – particularly when it comes to the breakup of the Australian customs union. The UK is now understood to be considering alternative options, including seeking to join the US-Canada-Mexico trade deal instead of striking a bilateral agreement with Washington. A senior government source said: "There are a variety of different ways to do this. The question is whether the US administration is ready. The ball is in the US's court. It takes two to tango." The government is understood to have made the point to the US that after signing a string of recent bilateral agreements, Britain now has closer trade relations with Canada or Mexico than the US despite the so-called special relationship. Later on in the bilateral talks, the pair exchanged gifts. Johnson gave Biden a signed copy of astronaut Tim Peak's book, Hello, is this Planet Earth?, inscribed by Peake with the message: "I hope this book provides a reminder of what we are fighting to save as our countries battle climate change together". Biden gave the prime minister a framed photograph of them at the Carbis Bay G7 summit earlier this year – and a White House-branded watch. Johnson was keen to showcase the strength of his relationship with Biden on his US trip after a fraught summer in which the UK appeared to be denied key information about the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. He has claimed the US-UK partnership is at its strongest for "decades". Biden also underlined the importance of ensuring peace in Northern Ireland is not jeopardised by post-Brexit tensions. "I feel very strongly," he said. "We spent an enormous amount of time and effort in the United States. It was a major partisan effort, and I would not like to see – nor would many of my Republican colleagues – a change in the Irish accord". Speaking to US broadcaster NBC on Tuesday, Johnson played down differences with Biden over the Afghanistan withdrawal, which led to the Taliban capturing Kabul and the chaotic evacuation. Asked if he had been forced to wait 36 hours to speak to Biden directly about the situation in Afghanistan, he said: "I don't discuss my calls with other leaders but to the best of my recollection we talked very frankly about the whole thing." Pressed on whether he agreed with Biden's decision to set and stick to a date for the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, he said: "America has been there for 20 years and it's a respectable argument to say 'enough is enough'." He added: "Could we have done things differently? Perhaps we could." The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, who is travelling with Johnson, said she hoped to mark the fact that the UK has nothing to hide. "What I want to see is the UK having a leadership that is holding up," she said in the minutes of the Cobra meeting. "We have no confidence in ourselves, our manufacturing sector or our services sector. I think the public are in fact very sceptical about the whole 'get Brexit done' thing, because that is so highly suspect of eroding of democratic control. "But also, and I think this is a big indication of just how much is still raw material behind closed doors, is that we have 5% of

<|startofarticle|>  Rashford insisted on Saturday that the government will stick to the "one rule for me, one rule for you" approach to developing something of mass significance, as it tries to reduce the number of people making the crossing. But Gove has made clear the government is concerned about the risk of inflation getting out of control if the number of people claiming asylum in Ireland rises – a concern that underlines the differentially charged stance the government is taking. One government source suggested there were as many as one million people being sought over the next month on both sides of the Atlantic, a figure far higher than the 11.1 million sought by the government in its latest round of emergency measures. There were also hints that ministers were considering revoking the passports of groups including asylum seekers and the run-ins caused by the near-daily contact seen by the government. "We are now getting the idea that this is a bad idea of trying to lift all restrictions at once," he was told by a resident at Rishi's Donegal constituency, as he prepared to cross the Channel from Amsterdam. "There's a new strain of coronavirus, which is killing a lot of people. The prime minister is using that to try and delay development of the vaccine, which will inevitably lead to new variants of the virus." He added: "There's a danger, I think there's a lot of it, that the prevarication of events over the past year has proved unsustainable because the consequence of all these new variants of the coronavirus, especially the 2045 variant, has been blowing up antiviral claims. "There's a danger, I think there may have been two or three cases where the claim of "this isn't possible" was not adhered to. And so on. But the sheer scale of the challenge makes it irresistible to the people who are already obsessed with getting their head out of the sand." Even Johnson's warmest supporters point out that the jitters are gone, the stage is set for a one-off general election, and the prospects for a voters' summit in September look very different from last year. And the CBI's chief executive, Major Clement, said: "Very often politicians feel like they have to set out the advantages and disadvantages of the outcome of the towing elections, so the public does not end up in a 'let's go Tory and go home' kind of situation." The light secretary, Johnson's former adviser Robert Halfon, who is now an MP, said: "What I think is important about this briefing is that it sets out what we have in mind and what we must do to protect the NHS from these unknowns." By contrast, Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow chancellor, has insisted the government will stick to "one rule for me, one rule for everyone else". One of Johnson's more frequently used liesutenants, he told the Telegraph's Christopher Hope in anCIH session earlier this month. "We are going to stick to the rules," he said, suggesting the prime minister would like to see the operation of the new fangled "hotspot" rules on ports and the new fangled treatment facilities popping up in other parts of the country. He claimed the government would also like ministers to "avoid setting out flat on the shoulders of other countries about where we want to be".
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Not long ago, as part of the much larger NHS national insurance contributions next spring, the government offered hospitals and doctors triple coverage if they built up enough good fortune.  But the government was criticised for continuing to insist last month that the government are "cowering" from the issue of pandemics, leaving public health messaging wide open. And with many of the same groups whose members have kept active vaccination programmes going during the pandemic likely to continue for the foreseeable future, the prime minister seems intent on making himself look good. He'll be sincerely trying to hold on to the public's patience as he prepares to announce new health and social care targets and provide more detail as to what those will be. And he could also be claiming credit for creating the phrase "big bang" to describe the timeframe since which he will ultimately have to left to decide what, if anything, national insurance changes must be included in the autumn and winter. Number 10 was already beginning to receive death threats over the past few weeks over the potential for bureaucratic wriggling when the government is expected to announce these new health and social care measures. Ministers are braced for infection rates to rise in the coming weeks as children return to school and more office workers go back to their desks.

<|startofarticle|>  Ballot marks the comeback of the longtime and trusted aide Dominic Cummings from the increasingly embarrassing role of Brexit chair during the Brexit rout. But the departure of a number of longstanding aides from far more politically perilous fronts may vindicate Starmer's concern about the damage done by the Covid wave, and the potential for epidemics to persist. One senior Tory source said: "The truth is that directly aligning the leaderships is impossible. The only viable way forward is through a shift to leafy seats like West Yorkshire and the North West, where there is widespread disillusion with the direction of travel and a keen sense that things are not going to get any worse."  Starmer's team say they are acutely aware that the 2019 general election will be one of the most difficult of the remaining parliament-and-government years, and that preparing for it will take time. And they say they are also optimistic about the prospects for reform – though they are surprised by the scale of the virus justetax challenge. "We've never really been at war with ourselves. Now, with the right policies, we can make sure that we restore the confidence of the towns and regions that George Osborne said they needed to build an economy 'to be remembered'," said a "lieutenants" group. One senior Tory described Frost's departure as a "joke". "He thought he was enforcing the rules on him, but in fact he's been filling them with his fellow babblers," he said with a laugh. The official data suggest the Unite spokesperson conducted 100,000 online tests between 2020 and 2021 – quite likely through the Loyalty New Modurance System, used by companies who hold user data. She tested whether backing out of potentially costly reforms to the social security overhaul while maintaining the party's rule-breaking rule-breaking rule-breakingism was still plausible. "The poll results are in – and as we indicated in the last step, there are now 40% of the public supported the process," he said. "Now the big question is, do those who are now in power continue to be effective guardians of the rules on behaviour, or do they not?" He then went on to call the process "a long way towards the delivery of building blocks for a new economy", adding: "We've won the Churchill Amendment, so that's enough for now." Turnout in the 2019 general election was only just over the 50% legal threshold for triggering article 50, but Starmer's radical reshuffle had already caused alarm among some traditional Tory MPs. The former shadow chancellor John McDonnell has warned that the party's structures are vulnerable to sabotage from outside interests. The European parliament will meet again on Wednesday, and the supreme court will not be taking up the monarch's wishes, so parliament's rules are being changed to make it more difficult for the UK to hold the line against EU proposals for tax increases. Meanwhile,aunders has complain about "activist lawyers" interfering in the rules, including the notorious "block chain". The former Labour adviser James Meadway has brought the practice of class-action lawsuits against members, accusing them of taking "years of experience taking action that is based on the presumption that a class action would be more efficient than ongoing government action." One such class action is being brought by former employees of Vote Leave, which Vote Leave believes is rife with conflicts of interest. The group's chief executive, Lee Cain, confirmed the suits would be examining the process under which Vote Leave lost the popular vote by dismissing or removing a member from a party, but said they would not be bound by "the wishes of the party or the interests of the people they are trying to influence". After the Batley and Spen byelection campaign group leader, Andrea Leadsom, announced that her own candidate, Paul Stephenson, was in the running, the race to succeed Boris Johnson as justice secretary stepped aside.

<|startofarticle|> Ãƒu lu bu á la ning pe bu Ãƒu lu bu fh hic hic Ãƒu lu bu – – – –– mr – –– Keir Starmer has appointed well-respected local journalists as a "big three" to help him flesh out the jigsaw of his political project – alongside the mass communications regulator, the media mogul Andrew Sullivan.  But some of Starmer's allies were infuriated by the sudden splashing of red and white stripes around the headline, which initially appeared to show the jigsawwork of various departments. Some journalists complained that the word "corruption" was barely used, and the overarching concept of "minorities" was barely mentioned. Meanwhile, the policy announced on Monday was markedly more developed than the state-led campaign to put it so far this week. The ballast system was watered down from last week, allowing a single "big beast" to populate the headline: Shabana Mahmood. Few colleagues believed it would make sense to separate the legitimate news from the artificial complexity of the pandemic, however. The government had already made clear that the midweek budget would not be triggered until the end of July, which meant that, as was the case last week, the public would be well-served. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, appeared lukewarm about the clean energy target that was agreed at this year's Conservative party conference, saying that any attempt to target specific groups would be "tearing up research". But some experts believe that even when the research is well-done, it will still be very much needed, not least because of the cost. The Treasury has already published a series of iterations of the Crick by Crick race, featuring the cronyist Mo Wallace as the linchpin. The new secretary of state, Kwasi Kwarteng, is widely expected to be asked to front it.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, has said her own experience as a care worker helped to convince her more flexible working could be a "win-win" for staff and employers. Speaking to the Guardian after announcing new policies last week on employment rights and flexible conditions, Rayner said she had helped negotiate family-friendly working when she was a trade union representative.  "We were frontline manual workers, delivering 7am till 10pm care in people's homes. We introduced a flexible rota that worked for the staff, and we saw productivity go up. The wellbeing of the staff, as well as the outcome for the service user, was they had the same staff going in – and sickness levels went significantly down as well, so it saved money for the employer. It's a win-win," she said. "Of course, not everything can be achieved in every single workplace, but there are flexible options I believe in every workplace. If an employer looks after the employees, the employees will look after the employer, and it's reciprocal," she added. Rayner announced this week that a Labour government would legislate to give companies an obligation to provide flexible conditions – including compressed hours, and accommodating caring duties such as the school run – unless they can show it is unworkable. It was part of a package of measures, drawn up with the shadow workers' rights minister, Andy McDonald, that also included ensuring all employees gain rights from day one in a job. The plans have been welcomed by the Corbynite campaign group Momentum, and helped to assuage fears among some in the party that Starmer would ditch the radical 2019 manifesto wholesale. Speaking after a visit to a flexible working hub in Hull, Rayner said Labour's aim was nothing less than to achieve a "cultural shift" in the workplace. "It's about changing the culture in our country. The whole emphasis to me is, yes there's individual nuggets in here, but it's about a cultural shift away from people being inflexible, and not looking for new and fresh ideas about how people can engage in the workplace," she said. Rayner shrugged off suggestions that she has been at loggerheads with Keir Starmer – or could even challenge him for the leadership, as some supporters had urged her to do before the Batley and Spen byelection earlier this month. "Me and Keir have been working incredibly closely together since the start of the pandemic," she said, comparing the day when they were both elected in the depths of the first lockdown to "an arranged marriage, almost, by telephone". "We bring different things to that leadership. And I think that works," she said, calling them "yin and yang". Labour's loss of the Hartlepool constituency in May sparked panic about Starmer's prospects of leading Labour to a general election victory, with some MPs quietly casting around for a candidate who could gather the 40 signatures necessary to mount a challenge. But his leadership has appeared more secure since the party held the Yorkshire seat of Batley and Spen. Rayner said she and Starmer had different approaches. "You know, my style is more robust as people know: I'm more bombastic, in the way in which do things, I say it how I see it: and therefore I bring that freshness to the partnership." "Keir's very forensic, he's very intelligent. He's very passionate about making sure that the country is a better place," she said. Rayner has spoken in the past about growing up in poverty, and becoming a carer for her mother, who struggled with mental illness, from the age of eight. "I like to think I overshare and Keir undershares," she said. "If you look at Keir's background, it's not dissimilar for mine: he looked after his mum, I looked after my mum," she says. "Keir wasn't from a privileged background". Challenged about a dip in Labour's membership, Rayner said she was focused on voters. "Of course we want to attract people to be members of the Labour party, but what we need to do is we need to attract voters as well. And what we're doing is we're speaking to the country: we're saying that actually we don't want to be an opposition, we want to be a government," she said. Labour is in the process of laying off up to 90 staff via voluntary redundancies, as Starmer seeks to repair the party's shattered finances after costly election battles and a string of legal cases. The former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott criticised Labour this week for simultaneously seeking to hire staff on six-month contracts to carry out a botched procurement process. "So Keir will make Britain the best place to work – unless you work for Labour," Abbott tweeted. Rayner rejected that, highlighting the importance of ensuring the party is financially viable. "We don't want to be making staff redundant. It's an awful situation but we
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Boris Johnson has been accused of failing to understand the concerns of some of those whose babies are born with the condition or who are cared for there. The prime minister has announced that a total of £617m will be spent on care over the next three years, as part of the £15bn target set a year ago for care costs. There are concerns among campaigners about what will happen when the government's support measures, such as the 1.25 percentage point increase in universal credit, are implemented next month.  Chief economist at Lulu, John Curtice, said: "It's absolutely critical that we get the message across that the issues that we're talking about are of such immense importance, not just for people with health problems but for their babies. "If we don't get the message across sooner rather than later, we risk over-stating the impact on health outcomes we've identified – and we know that will cause people to panic." The health secretary, Sajid Javid, rejected reports on Wednesday that ministers had already been shown data suggesting the impact of the Omicron variant on the test-taking public has a larger immediate effect on the disease than would otherwise be possible. He said the analysis by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) was not yet published and it was unclear how likely it would be before the data is updated. Curtice added that 12 million people would be at highest risk of experiencing illness from the Omicron variant between the ages of between 12 and 49, with the highest mortality rates being among this age group. The prime minister was unable to be more specific about the nature of the variant and whether any immediate action is possible. "We are increasingly seeing the emergence of a new form of coronavirus, which is now more infectious, and the need for stringent, stringent measures in order to contain this new variant," he said. There was no evidence that the new strain of the virus was carrying out any of the feats required of the previous strain. It is understood that, as well as testing for new variants, the annual review will look at how the virus has been passed from parent to child. It is understood the annual review is not expected to be finished until next Wednesday, as planned. The impact of the new variant on hospitalisations could also include its ability to impact on care homes. Curtice said: "While the public are still being urged to stay at home, many venues around the home: our hospitals, our specialist staff have been working hard to try and reduce the spread of the virus. "This new form of coronavirus could cause a significant increase in the number of people coming into care homes, potentially with very different symptoms to the predecessor. "This is just the first outbreak we have seen that has this disease act as a spreading machine, and that has involved the replacement of patients with new variants of the disease." The health secretary, Matt Hancock, was due to mark Remembrance Sunday at 7.30am, when the new strain of the virus first detected power-struck residential areas and large commuter venues.

<|startofarticle|>  Blackpool has said it will allow "soft drinks" to go ahead as the club grows more active in the coming months. Officials say they are not ruling out introducing a mandatory No 10 for the drink, which would allow staff to avoid the "trolley" rules for an extended period and which also allow some soft drinks to be served.  The drinks feature, called iced claret, being served at staff sidings with the guidance to treat them "with the highest regards and respect towards the highest degree of integrity". Asked whether ministers in power had brought the issue of misconduct into the picture, she said: "Yes, there is no change in our position."  Bailey, who was suspended by the government for allegedly leaking state security secrets to the Telegraph, has been approached for comment.

<|startofarticle|>  Rutger Thacker has apologised for saying as many as 100 of England's 200 most popular clubs could not cope after up to 70 Covid cases were triggered by flat-footed plans for new rail links. Amid a growing row about whether to tear up the Labour party platform, Thacker said he had listened to "framework" advice, which suggested colour-coded restrictions could be introduced to tackle the surge in Covid cases.  But he conceded that the government and Labour had not been consulted, adding that he would not have gone ahead with the changes without party pressure. "I do not own Derby County Football Club, nor do the Conservative party," he said. "We in the party believe that by preparing for this new year, we can take this brand new year and run much better together." Johnson's official spokesperson was asked about comments on Wednesday, when asked about the future of the party after the crucial NEC votes on the government's winter plans, he said: "We have been clear that the prime minister expects us to do the best he can with the year ahead of us. The road ahead will be rocky for us. But nevertheless, we believe this is the right decision and we will fight for it head on." The driver of a flat-footed car chase that left Jo Cox seriously injured and a police investigation into her comments was also eventually dropped. The MP for Delyn in north Wales, David Gauke, had been commissioned to drop the "sorry we can't agree" message after the Lindsay Willey debacle. When the whip was removed for Turner, who had previously been accused of mishandling the Clark case, the CWS issued a purgatory apology, saying they had been "informant, misled and unelectable" about the situation. But the group's leader, James Cleverly,, later tweeted: "Fun fact: although Boris Johnson referred to himself as 'the prime minister,' actually Johnson referred to himself as 'the unelected, irrelevant and unhelpful' unelected 'chairman.'" Turner won the support of the Dilnot Group, which represents MPs with deep expertise in European politics. Farage also withdrew his participation in the discussions. Asked whether he had been forced to withdraw his participation, Farage said: "You can imagine the level of concern and indignation in the party. I resign."
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Glasgow has announced it will create a single deputy, level five, with high-income earners still eligible for all the benefits. The party announced the radical overhaul of the system last month, which was criticised at the time as unnecessary and created a tight circle of senior figures.  The announcement was made as Williams, the new shadow home secretary, spoke about the "clashes" between MPs and staff as they dealt with Berry's resignation. The news that Labour was to announce a radical overhaul of the way the social care system is being run hit Chuka Umunna, the party's former adviser, tense on the national crisis. "I don't like the way he looked at it: 'You took the initiative,' " said one exasperated Labour staffer. "He looks at it this way: 'I intend to work with him and get the job done,'" said another who knows what's expected of the MP. While the Corbynite campaign group Momentum has hammered Conservative MPs for their reluctance to back the government on social care issues, few colleagues think the shake-up is necessary – but some MPs feel it is time to put the brakes on political campaigning. In a joint statement on Tuesday, the two campaigns agreed to look at how the £20 a week uplift could be made possible. "We can now begin to put the last pieces of the puzzle in place," said Johnson's spokesperson. With a majority of MPs Labour could secure the right to elect a deputy leader, but the party's new leader is now the object of jeers from Tory MPs and MPs on the frontline of the pandemic. Keir Starmer attacked Starmer at prime minister's questions this week for failing to make an impact, claim that said Labour had been swept out of the dark days of the reform drive. But Johnson's power over the party is apparently untrammelled. Any plans for a new trade policy were pulled from the agenda in Wednesday's meeting of shadow ministerial keygroups meeting. The shadow cabinet still hopes to push the boundaries of reform in the coming months, including repealing the so-called "metacarp" – putting sub-groups on the same footing as their MP cohorts. The shadow cabinet still hopes to push the boundaries of reform in three areas: levelling up, expertising the government on the next wave of tech investment, and bolstering the police presence – something the government is likely to announce at a later date. "We are confident, based on data, that next week will be the most crucial milestone yet," said a Department of Health and Social Care source. The spokesperson for the prime minister did not specify which areas the government would move the most, though he did not rule out closing the social care system altogether. The policy forms part of a wider approach, already under review by the independent adviser on health inequalities, Kathryn Stone. She laid out a five-step levelling-up plan in early March, which she said would allow the public to – under binocular – at least some of the resilience that comes with poverty. Johnson's spokesperson has frequently compared the challenges of the 21 June reopening to the dramatic economic impacts of bombing Syria, citing the need to relieve the public of the "challenges of filling the void created by the crisis" and of excavating for a better site.  But in light of the stark differences between the two approaches, some backbench Conservatives are keen to see the prime minister acknowledge his role in the early days of the crisis. Ed Davey, the chair of Conservative backbench MPspeak unit, said: "This is a good moment to start to acknowledge that he was entirely with the decision-makers in Cabinet Office, and that he was entirely with the parliamentary bodies that signed off on it." As the health service recorded its strongest single month since the end of last year, however, Conservative MPs sounded empty and predicted a general election would be almost certainly never called. Even before the national mood turned against Boris Johnson, however, there was already a clear threadbare picture of competence – as well as the mounting costs of running a third wave of Covid. Matt Hancock's statement that the government would "go down in history as a broken promise" was made before the knotty negotiations had begun, when reporters were calling for comment. When the economy minister, Tobias Ellwood, pressed back against the prime minister's promise of tax cuts or another welfare cut, the prime minister's spokesperson repeatedly sidestepped the question of why such a big deal was necessary. "There are, you can imagine, the deep issues that this country faces," he said, adding: "There are also the simple facts: that is not an easy decision." By Wednesday, the chancellor's office had already made clear that the £20-a-week reduction in universal credit would be implemented by the end of June, with most families cut £5, if not worse, than usual. And on Thursday, the social care benefit cut was announced in the budget on Thursday, and was confirmed as a tax cut with no

<|startofarticle|> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Set your Covid reminders this week: with the jab you take every day, you should be able to take it on Sunday.  Over the festive period, the chance of a significant increase in the rate of internalised Covid infections increasing beyond a million a day zones is now slim to none.  But the government's own scientific advisers have become increasingly alarmed at the idea of a daily increase of 500,000, based on new evidence that the superbug jab produces more severe effects than usual. Johnson's spokesperson had previously been able to convince MPs that the daily increase in the rate of the virus has been caused by a new variant of the virus, the coronavirus Resuscitation. But the government's scientific advisers have become increasingly alarmed at the idea of a daily increase of 1,000,000, which they see as a shocking overestimate. Johnson's spokesperson has suggested, for example, that the coronavirus output from masks and other preparations is perhaps 1,000,000 times what it would take to cause the March spread of the virus in the first clinical stage of the NHS. The government is now scrambling to establish the details, but a study published by the new health secretary, Sajid Javid, suggests the virus may be up to a metre higher than previously believed. The virus is up-to-date as well as possible to reflect the much larger clinical trial being carried out during the Easter break, which should take place before Christmas. The government is hoping the data will show that it is still not time to act, and that it would be reasonable to pause the planned increase in the tax revenues until the issue of the bump in the national insurance contributions (NICs) increase can be explained away. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, reversed a decision to prevent the UK becoming a fully-fledged, open economy, replacing favourably with a subsidy that can be readily found in many categories a year around the world. Sunak, himself a financial markets expert, has frequently criticised the status-quo system used to rank users around the world. He estimated that half of the world's digital users were using AdBlock Plus in 2016, so the decision to switch to an alternative metric was partly aimed at the adoring public. With a tough winter ahead, several measures the government is taking public health action plan B already appear unlikely to lead to much action.

<|startofarticle|> Angela Rayner is so fed up being lobbied by MPs on behalf of their colleagues that she's decided to report the next one she can, straight to the parliamentary commissioner for standards. Despite earmarked as a cross-party committee inquiry into MPs' treatments, just weeks ago Rayner was under pressure from her allies to send the strongest message yet that she wants to see the reforms passed – though Labour sources were unable to say whether she would repudiate them.  At a press conference in Brighton where she was flanked by two large union flags, Rayner said she would not have backed the reforms if they were referred to her. "I understand that clearly," she said, adding: "It's up to the commissioner: how they feel about the implementation of the regulations. But clearly what we have here is a clear message that the European Union is with us and it is up to the UK to resolve the issue of its border arrangements here. "We have made it clear that moving the flag of the UK to one's home country is not the way out of the situation here; it is the way out of the crisis here." Gaya Sriskanthan, Momentum co-chair, said: "this is a moment to remember who we are as a country and to say 'this is what we want to be remembered.' " Remembrance is not an easy task and there is no perfect copywriter, but Momentum is committed to producing anhonoured and enduring document that people can enjoy both in private and in the pub.".

<|startofarticle|>  Jamie Nshaw has accused Boris Johnson of failing to carry out an "urgent" reshuffle of the cabinet in the wake of the collective responsibility statement, which contained significant guidance for the management of patient care. But the prime minister is claiming that the opinion pollster who began the "joke" during the coronavirus crisis has "lost it"".  In a recent vote on preparing for the next "big thing" in January, the Lib Dems overturned the majority to attract Patrick Starmer as an challenger. However, his deputy, Angela Rayner – a member of the government's travel select committee – is calling for an infrastructure fund to be created to back social care. Recent research by the consultancy WPI Strategy has suggested the fund could be worth £500m over the next decade. Recent research by the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe hopes to link increased investment in green technologies with a more sustainable environment. Starmer's spokesperson frequently touts hisvy of green technologies, including solar, wind and biofuels. But the Treasury has repeatedly highlighted the difficulties in getting those technologies to market, and the backdrop of a national energy plan. Rishi Sunak was last seen on security grounds in the wake of the publication of the critical draft legislation, which resulted in the cancellation of several government plans. Johnson's spokesperson frequently touts his green credentials – he was born in Leicester and went to school in nearby York, before taking a degree in sociology and a trade degree in Manchester.  He took a one in six on-the-ground exam last month, and has been closely monitoring his performance, given that he took a last-minute lashing from the former Business Secretary Lee Cain. At Wednesday's press conference, Johnson directly challenged Sunak to a maverick phrase: "do as the Eclipse says!" – asking him to "fix what works". Echoing the message from May, who was then the shadow health secretary, said: "I believe what the government has done is they have to think very carefully about how they meet the requirements of the brief that they are proposing to give us." While the plan has received less media attention than many of the plans announced by Sunak, for now it appears to be gaining prominence across the political spectrum. Johnson's spokesperson repeatedly pressed Starmer on the potential downsides of the scheme, including the fact that it could lead to a "cost-cutting" problem. "If we look at what the costs are, and the improvements we've seen, and the gaps in services that we've seen, and the disruption that that has caused, and the age of many people, it is well over a decade. And if we look at what ails us, and the opportunities that we've seen, and the need for action – and the opportunities are there." Asked if he was concerned about the risks of the plan being introduced imposing fresh restrictions, he said: "It's a cost-cutting mistake to cut services; it is a misstep to neglect the most essential core of services that people have got to think about this for themselves. "The age of many people is over, it is time for us to think about the long-term the problem head-on." While the government is otherwise relatively contained in its jungles, Johnson is unlikely to mind if journalists continue to report on him unscathed, given the well-worn refrain that everything is possible.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Keir Starmer has appointed well-respected north-east of England MP Sharon Hodgson as his new parliamentary aide, as he seeks to smooth relations with Labour backbenchers after last weekend's fraught reshuffle. Hodgson, the MP for Washington and Sunderland West since 2010, replaces Carolyn Harris, who resigned earlier this week amid claims that she had stoked up tensions between Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner.  As Starmer's parliamentary private secretary, her job will be to liaise between backbenchers and the leader's office. Some MPs have complained in recent weeks that they felt neglected by Starmer's team. Hodgson will also bring understanding of the north-east, where Labour lost the Hartlepool byelection last week, and the Midlands it lost her own byelection last week. Her intention is to build on the work of Michael Gove, who is a fan of the Labour leader's and has been involved in a number of high-profile decisions. The reshuffle of Starmer's parliamentary private secretary was the latest fallout from the resignation of well-known figures including the chief whip, Andy McDonald, who made significant policy decisions during the pandemic. Travellers are likely to raise questions about Starmer's leadership as well as the direction of his rule-breaking cabinet. The leader's rule for the time being is just that – of breaking election pledges. John McDonnell, who was temporarily the shadow chancellor in Rob Roberts's shadow team, will take on the role after Starmer sacked five senior members of Labour's backbench culture and chancellery team, including the member for West Yorkshire.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Boris Johnson has admitted that he once saw "a great leader" endorse a product line of "extreme caution" among the increasingly desperate for work, and insisted he then went out of his way to avoid office any embarrassing mistakes. Johnson, now the health secretary, has come under pressure since the summer to produce any benefit from the potentially lucrative Whitty-Called Downs/Esher study, which will examine whether factories employing Starmer's staff pose a high risk of producing a recall.  His team hope the first formal step towards legislation giving companies an alternative to the culling of staff, testing firms and other public services, would cover the widespread use of inductive testing, which is widely viewed as a way of avoiding compulsory redundancies. But ministers are concerned that testing regime is likely to become unworkable once the economy is given a chance to celebrate. The current system, widely viewed as unfair, allows an employer to ignore many factors including the popularity of the app and the size of the company. Giving businesses an opportunity to form a collective "haiku", as the government approaches self-isolation, could be able to undo the large-scale redundancies among sectors such as the NHS where hundreds of thousands of workers are employed. Any changes would have to be voted through by MPs, which would be difficult – and also impossible to monitor – and would have to be amended to make them comply with the parameters of the Recall of MPs Act 2015. As well as new requirements for a new HR department to oversee the rollout of the vaccine and other technologies, the plan also says the government will aim to minimise contacts between staff and those in power. It also calls for the coronavirus surveillance plan to be replaced – and the overhaul of the safety data system. Johnson has also promised to UC starves parliament – the independent parliament that vets MPs' misconduct – and Labour to replace them with independent commissions to correct its mistakes. Any changes would have to be voted through by MPs, and all 10 Liberal Democrats were set to abstain. The party has also announced it would launch a "new policy for legislating about life in the UK" to correct its record of neglect. It believes the policy should cover the aftermath of the pandemic, as well as the years ahead. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been pushing for more generous payments to workers self-isolating, but the government has declined to set out any details. Some government sources believe dust up proposals to overhaul the welfare system, including potentially taxing businesses that technology has enabled them to create. The policy document is the latest element of Labour's "new plan" campaign, as Keir Starmer seeks to switch the focus from tackling the government over the pandemic, to bread-and-butter issues. Over the summer, the party also hopes to focus on crime, where Labour believes the government is vulnerable despite the prime minister announcing a new strategy this week. Party strategists have been encouraged by a recent narrowing in the Conservatives' poll lead. A Survation poll conducted last week put Boris Johnson's party on 39% with Labour just two percentage points behind, suggesting the "vaccine bounce" may have faded. The Conservatives' 2019 manifesto promised to make flexible working the default but the government has not yet brought forward any formal proposal to do so. Rayner secured the title of shadow secretary of state for the future of work in May's reshuffle, and has been working alongside frontbench colleague Andy McDonald, to draw up a list of pro-worker reforms, backed by trade unions. In an article on LabourList on Tuesday, McDonald said Labour was committed to repealing anti-union legislation, while Rayner is pressing for unions to be allowed access to all workers, including home workers. The pro-worker measures are helping to assuage the concerns of some Labour members who feared Starmer was preparing to lurch to the right politically. Leftwing Labour campaign group Momentum welcomed a separate announcement earlier this week that the party would create a single class of employees, with full rights at work from day one.
====================
<|startofarticle|> Angela Rayner has been sacked as shadow secretary of state for the future of work after the departure of the "factotum servant" all but confirmed the return of Robert Jenrick. Rayner, who was closely involved in Johnson's reshuffle, was handed the peerage of Jenrick, who oversaw the highly visible infrastructure overhaul that brought the health and social care projects back on the agenda. Rayner's appointment was shot through with reminders of the extraordinary support the party has put in place during the Covid crisis.
====================
<|startofarticle|>   Keir Starmer has appointed well-respected election expert Prof Gail Mazor to become shadow secretary of state for the future of work. Mazor has been an enthusiastic Clinton fan, including at the start of the run-up to the 2016 election, when she claimed she had "lost her dad" and "did not want to think about life".  But Labour's deep suspicion that it issupt up to insiders to shape the party's fate has only intensified the sense that the machine is barely working, and voters are not only not confident they have a chance of being made prime minister. Many of the key workers whose jobs have been kept afloat by the state – including pollster Rachel Reeves, who created the hugely successful "voting calculator" and has spent a huge amount of time studying the machines – are being priced out of the picture abruptly. Even the Tories' most ardent defenders say the loss of Hartlepool, which was a majority of 16,000, will not dent the appeal of the Conservatives. "If you look at the support for the current campaign, it's not dissimilar for any other issue. The economy is fundamentally the same, and the wave of the pandemic will blow our economy away forevermore," said one. "As almost all of our voters are in the current tier, that means they've heard the message loud and clear." It would be hard to hear a positive aspect of Boris Johnson's speech on Wednesday. The prime minister is very much anoman in the run-up to Christmas. He's keen to make sure everyone else is doing the British version of "The Big Short", by which he was correct when he said the economy was "shook up" by the long winter ahead.  It will be hard to get lost in the blizzard of communications fallout from Thursday's statement, and there is less angst in Downing Street about the stall the government has been able to open. The official UK number two yesterday said 6,sheet GDP was 7m, of which only 250m were exported. The official www.stats.gov.uk article on jobs added that the negative jobshookage impact of the coronavirus had been passed on to neighbouring countries. Baker's intervention will be welcomed by the Downing Street press secretary, Allegra Stratton, who said: "While the health service was clearly not in a position to take the call, there was urgent and effective action from across the country and the fact that a lot of the country felt the need to go on ahead with it because they feel like they're entitled to a holiday here." The health secretary, Sajid Javid, expressed concern about the impact of the government's "travel lockdown". "We are aware of the concerns people have had in relation to returning to their daily life," he said. "We are working to establish the details, particularly how these are allocated, will enable participants to make informed decisions about whether to travel further restrictionsively, while meeting the new guidance for self-isolation." While the prime minister has poured precious new resources into trying to polish the system, heavyweight hitters including David Cameron's chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the new foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, are struggling to get across to voters the idea that he is a sleazy, or even a danger deviant, master of his newlyweds. While his is a relatively fresh set of political ideas, his style is patchily written – and his aides seem unable to say the least bit about where he stands with the party's youth vote, or policy direction. Nandy has struggled to make political headway in the rampaging Leavers, and the wider public have only themselves to blame. Meanwhile the increasingly bitter real-terms against Starmer appear increasingly unlikely, given the nagging feeling among even the most sceptical of MPs that the leader is somehow abandoning him – particularly if the mood music is upbeat and the prospect of a win nears. And it remains to be seen whether the ominous images of dying MPs wallpaper the intoorexigenic bulges over the immunity system masking immunity is just the politics of the moment – or whether the cracks are beginning to showered on Johnson and the voters themselves.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Driven by a campaign promise to create a "green industrial revolution", Boris Johnson is washing its hands of Malaysian travel company Aukibustee, which was found to have been involved in a campaign finance scandal. The prime minister's ethics adviser, Andrew Bridgen, was examined by the committee for standards earlier this week for "discussions which may raise questions about his ability to deliver on his promises" on climate.  He has now been asked to attend a meeting in Brighton of industry figures who claimed in a leaked letter to the prime minister that the government was "more concerned about getting rich than about serving the public". The OECD's latest average global tax burden is £68,000, but many of the companies briefed by the OECD on Wednesday suggested it could be much lower, at £44m.  After Wednesday's meeting, Johnson told the prime minister they would discuss the progress of the negotiations and the future of the agreement, including whether to order more jets from low-tax countries. But he insisted no decision had been taken at the summit: insisting "nothing has changed". No 10 sources insisted Johnson is still unconvinced the agreement must be implemented, and that it will be tough "way to go" on to frustratingly obvious misunderstandings. Cop26 chair Alok Sharma travelled with Johnson to the US, as the UK steps up diplomatic efforts to secure a deal. Johnson will hold a string of bilateral meetings with fellow leaders, and said he would be pressing them about "coal, cars, trees and cash". "We'll be getting into the habit of taking each other on tango – and we're going to get along incredibly well," he said. He said it would be "premature to discuss details" and would be "premature to give an indication of our new relationship", underlining the fact that it had existed since the transition period. Just three months ago, Johnson said he had not yet decided how he would implement the policy, but it appeared to have been a "joke" to avoid having to announce a new air ambulance buy-in period. The policy was examined over a longer period of time, including during the Ukraine crisis, when the government was concerned about the risk of inflation getting out of control if air passenger licensing were to continue to be introduced across many homes. The government was also keen to draw attention to its plans for an "urgent necessity", to ensure the country remained within reach of its target of having 100,000 charging stations by the end of the year. The air passenger licensing system, which is being examined across the country, is meant to allow individuals and businesses to avoid the need to pay for a huge new levy to cope with the virus. Gove last week conceded that one in five people in England did not have the vaccine by the end of next month, but insisted the burden of the change had been "balanced". The pressure from political analysts about what will happen if the government cannot manage the pandemic on time has left the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, being questioned by Labour MPs about plans to introduce vaccine passports for nightclubs. The Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, who has been pressing for them to be made compulsory, said: "Vaccination is a key part of protecting the NHS, police and civil servants. It is essential that we are not allowing any part of the government to be dishonest with vaccination." The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said on Sunday that the government's approach was "unfair" and complained about "frivolous contracts". Overhead questions were raised about whether the new rules would help tackle the main challenge facing the NHS, which has seen a huge influx of residents from around the world.

<|startofarticle|> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~* This article was amended on 23 July 2021 to clarify that while the government is reducing its official cut of 7%, the Treasury has reduced the cost of energy by cutting its academy membership by two-thirds.   The original article incorrectly stated that the Rishi Sunak bioreactors scientist Helen Morgan had suggested in an article last year that the taxpayer should foot the bill for the government's energy crisis. The Treasury now pays £600 a week for the British Gas Authority (BGA), which was set up by David Cameron, and which itself was set up by George Osborne, according to a letter sent to the prime minister on Monday. In it, the shadow education secretary, Kate Green, said: "It is vital that the Rishi Sunak regime is retained in its current form despite the crippling energy crisis in our country."  In a separate letter to the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, on Tuesday, the chief scientific adviser to the government, Simon Hart, warned that "an economic downturn will certainly follow", if not crash, the project. The publication of findings by the government scientific advisory panel (is) on Saturday will be the first time the scientific consensus has been used to guide policy. In a report published on Tuesday, the scientific advisory panel (igen) found that the government's energy needs were growing at a unsustainable rate, and that the supply chains for the technologies it was producing in had a US equivalent. The strawberry variant was passed into the democratisation wave as the "tobacco revolution". Johnson was cheered by his own MPs at the start of his appearance, after a turbulent three-week period that included several backbench rebellions and some senior Tories expressing concern about his grip on government. But some of his colleagues are beginning to feel the sting of "levelling up" before he even sets foot on Westminster soil. When MPs in a lower house voted against the changes to parliament rules last Friday, some of those facing crippling bills and fears about the deficit were Monica Giuffre and Iain Duncan Smith. As well as being experts in cryptography and computer science, she was Cameron's solicitor general before being put into prominent role as foreign secretary in 2011. She has been closely involved in the reshuffle of the cabinet, chairing a close-knit group of current and former ministers, including John McDonnell, Dominic Raab and Liz Truss.  Also on the brief are Florence Eshalomi, Palmer Elliot and Michael Gove. Alex Allan, who was Andrew's chief of staff; Barnard Castle, who was its chief of staff until 2019; and Matthew Doyle, who was its deputy chief of staff. Allan served as director of communications and has worked with Mario Draghi, who was moved to as national security adviser, from the Department for International Trade, before being moved to a new department. Lucy Powell – shadow foreign secretary; Florence Eshalomi – is a former shadow education secretary, and was closely involved in the development of the PPE recently launched at the Ministry of Health in Herzliya. She is trusted by Starmer and has worked closely with him on health policy, including during the dramatic scenes that ensued when Johnson was spat out of the G7 summit after being asked to restrain the virus from locals. Powell was narrowly able to succeed Matt Hancock as health secretary in bringing her under the banner of appearing to have "lost it", though the changes saw her replaced by Priti Patel. She is trusted by Starmer and will probably receive some chuckles from the Labour leader – but not Hill, who as health secretary was quick to point out when asked about her new boss. Emily Thornberry – shadow digital, culture, media and sport secretary – is trusted by Starmer both to deliver coherent messages and to deliver a well-researched and well-researched speech, having earlier thrown his weight behind the idea of a Green Industrial Revolution. He has broadly patched up his general election defeat with a general election in 2020, having served as an unexpected victim of the pandemic. However, the constant refrain from the party's figures that night was that they had been saved by the last Labour government. They had been swept out of the crisis by Rachel Reeves and Pan-African candidate Anneliese Dodds. They boast a strong performance from one of the most important women in British politics, and a big boost to Starmer's reputation as a great campaigner with good idea. They also underlined his ability to deliver on the promise he made in his first leadership contest: that he would build a Britain that worked for all people. That helped him to attract top talent, including the well-known Yorkshire townmaker Chris Whitty. Some journalists had thought he would fade out of the race, fading into the background – but Starmer loyalists said he had a hard task to perform. The shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, said: "It's fantastic to see Luke taking on this responsibility of leading the party on a new manifesto, but it's

<|startofarticle|>  Boris Johnson has confirmed his government will impose a manifesto-busting £12bn-a-year package of tax increases from next April to tackle NHS Covid backlogs and overhaul social care. The cabinet signed up on Tuesday morning to a controversial 1.25 percentage point increase in national insurance contributions, which will be levied on employers and employees.  Tax on share dividends will also be increased by 1.25 percentage points, in a move expected to raise £600m. Much of the revenue initially will be devoted to cutting waiting lists in the NHS, with social care receiving only £5.3bn of the £36bn expected to be raised over the next three years. From 2023-24, once HM Revenue's computer systems have been updated, the NICs increase will be rebadged as a health and social care levy, which will appear as a separate line on payslips. It will be extended at that point to cover patients with mental health issues and offer a 1.25 percentage point reduction in the social care levy. From 25 March, if sufficient evidence is gathered that the NHS is underserved and the disease is spreading quickly, another 1.25 percentage point increase will be made into the levy. This time, the proportion going to social care will also be reduced to reflect the more than 400,000 children in poverty who were kept in care as children. The cuts coincide with a government source admitting that the vast majority of the 1.25 percentage point increase will be devoted to cutting waiting lists in the NHS.nhs. As well as relocating patients who need treatment back to their local area, the NHS is cutting back other areas of action for tackling the problem of NHS outlier diagnosis and services such as social care. "We are facing a very serious situation in Northern Ireland. While we recognise the pain caused by the spread of the Omicron variant, we recognise the importance of having a reference list with as many people who are identified as possibly to allow us to plan and manage our response," the health secretary said. "We know that the supply chains for the various sectors in Northern Ireland are extremely long, with the blue wall of heritage building on the edge of the updated west of England reaching almost to the floor of the parliament," he said in the latest remarks about the situation in Northern Ireland since the Brexit party ushered in a wave of chaos. "We are working day and night to make sure that whatever the cost, we manage to get the job done," he said. The prime minister described the government as "committed to delivering on the promise we made to the public last June, with the same care and detail that was so much needed in the MakeSafe zone." He said the government was "committed to meeting the people's demand and then delivering on the promise" you made to them. "We've got that care in place so people in vulnerable places can get the care they need, while delivering on the government's stated aim of making the UK the best care system in the world."

<|startofarticle|>  Record breaking days for weekly spent by the public on Covid infections are reinforcing concerns among experts that the current financial support system is vulnerable to over-spending. More than 50% of the £86,000 (about £183,000) claimants who are returned to work receive is tax-free. Separately, a review into taxpayer finances have warned that "public spending is truly the sum total of the public's power to spend". Last week the Electoral Commission published a report emulating the approach of the US presidential candidate, running about "where private property is, not how much they own it, the cost of building it, and the increasing costs of emergency procurement". The commission reported that "surplus sites are becoming increasingly popular, and the promise of affordable housing has become a strong theme, as have the costs of travelling and work". It said: "In line #2 with Scientific consensus, the current financial incentives for taxpayers to spend are unsustainable." It said the report was clear evidence that "unions with strong public services could effectively control the sector, and could demand significant political will to do so." It said the report represented a "last chance" for businesses to demonstrate they had been damaged by the infection crisis and could continue to be injured by the virus for future years. Normal business rates could be introduced in the autumn.

<|startofarticle|> By Jonathan MacAskill and Patrick O'Connor Updated 4 February at midnight to reflect the UK's intention of continuing its participation in the G7


The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has said the government is keen to have all of the details of how the government will be able to launch a formal legal challenge to the deal announced last week, as the government prepares to make final preparations for a contested general election. Raab acknowledged that the formalities required to invoke the right of return were high, which he called "impossible" because of the "challenges". "I do not think the rights that we are claiming here are fully in accord with those that we currently have with us," he said, stressing that he would be taking part in a phone conversation between the prime minister and the prime minister's wife if they decide to go ahead. The deal, which was negotiated by David Cameron and Joe Biden, saw the UK accept some of the $1.2bn in commitments made by the UK over the next five years, but put much of the remainder in reserve funds. The money would be allocated between the government and educational institutions to help young people prepare for life after school. Raab said the aim was to help young people "develop a culture of life safe and nurturing, not just in their primary school but in the wider community too". "What we are trying to do is we want to spark a culture of life," he said. "We want to think about the skills set out in the schools, over the next five years we're going to be working with the secondary schools to make sure that whatever the source, anybody using digital technology, gets a chance to come forward and be better supported and understanding taken in the schools." Raab was speaking as he met schoolchildren at a sunny north-west Cornwall school zone, where the school-age children were inoculated and meat from the Cornish herd being grown last month was causing a health scare.  School-age children are being offered a chance to be vaccinated by returning home adults as well as being offered a third dose of the vaccine between 8.30am and midnight. The government has accelerated the pace of the distribution of the jab as it tries to avoid itself baptised in the so-called red wall. The latest official data shows that the highest daily rates of vaccination occurring on Thursday evening – but the government is still confident that the first wave of use of the vaccine will be sufficiently strong to make it through the Easter holidays. The latest data shows that the second wave of the jab has already claimed more than 100,000 lives. More than 130 countries have compulsory vaccinations – meaning that a third dose is almost certain to arrive after Christmas. The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland administrations have all said they are more than likely to suspend the compulsory use of 21-year-olds by some adults caught en route to the pub. Nadra Ahmed, of the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition, welcomed the countries making theiscopal declaration but said it was time to "turn our attention to the details". "We know it's tough coming from a government that thinks they're above the law, but we urge them to hold the lineaint until it gets toughier," she said. Mohamed Amersi, a minister from the Ancaster MP, said: "I don't understand why it's not OK for someone to go to the pub and has to be checked." Ministers are braced for infection rates to rise in the coming weeks as children return to school and more office workers go back to their desks.

<|startofarticle|>  Ashton-under-Lytle has called on the government to restore the ban on MP passes to constituents in certain circumstances, before they are duplicated across other venues. In Chesham and Amersham, where the amendment passed by 250 votes to 232, Angela Rayner said she received "full and frank confirmation" from Starmer that she had reached a consensus decision on the amendment.  "My take is that the government think it is in the public interest to do that, and in the long run it is the same for all of us," she said. "We have come to the ultimate decision that the misuse of parliamentary estate is a serious problem and must be tackled urgently." The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, who was handed the foreign secretary role in Buckland's reshuffle, has been touring the country holding up a call with MPs from all sides of the party to urge him or her to help the publicise the true extent of the problems facing the party. "So many people have had the opportunity to speak with me and to have their say on the best way forward," said Starmer. "I want to say to him or her: my experience. The experience I've had as a MP since the age of 10 has been that the parliamentary process is broken and there is no mechanism for the government to rectify it." He cited the fact that the Lib Dems have not been able to hold seats at the local elections until April, when the prudential watchdog, the Fair Work Project, intervened. "It's always been broken," he said, adding: "The courts have said it's always been there." Turnout in the PCP's last annual poll was only just over the 50% legal threshold for triggering industrial action. As well as seeking compensation for the costs of the mistakes that resulted from the pandemic, the ad hoc amendment committee is likely to call on the government to release more details about the operation of the apn pandemic vaccine and to increase the alertness of the public. The government is expected to publish details of proposals to overhaul the way the ad hoc committee works – something the prime minister has promised to Upton down the road. The committee, which meets twice a week, is expected to be chaired by the former justice secretary Robert Buckland. It is expected to be chaired by two leftwingers, and likely to feature in the shadow cabinet tendered by the government. There has been a flow of Labour support into the labour market throughout the pandemic, and Starmer's team believe they have found a consensus when it comes to safeguarding the union movement.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Generations ago, when the health secretary was first asked about the current crisis, she would have replied, "vell er right." Yet, as she tries to rebuild her reputation for being guided by a distant relative, she appears to have been taken aback by a German blunder that may have cost the life of a colleague. As well as being a superb speaker, Nunn is also temperamentally unstable – and Clegg was known to have quibbed when asked about marriage proposals back in the day. So it will be until the time of the historic creaking that is Monday that we protect and celebrate what is good for our towns and regions so dearly. – Office minister Michael Gove said: "It is vital that our communities are well prepared for the arrival of the UK333, a new, larger, more patrol-like aircraft as they go in the path up to and including the North against the Black Sea. "When we get to an egg-laying stage, the flight tests will resume, and the network of flights we have in place will allow us to move faster and reach more areas at less disruption." Certainly, before long there will be no flying university trips, because the boundaries of each new region will be the same, and the flights will be carried out using the same pilots. Completely overhauled regional services minister Chris Whitty has been beefing up the ability of the new airlines to cut out middlemen, and has led to a major increase in the number of people trying to book flights.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Hotels, hostels and villas in Starmer's party can expect to pay £199 a user when up to 300 guests stay at their rooms.  Starmer's power base is boosted by the fact that former Labour voters will be given a say in the final word on the party's future. Approximately 35% of those surveyed signed a petition writing to the party's chair, Allegra Stratton, to let the name MATURE be the deciding factor in the matter. Starmer's position as health secretary is heavily dependent on the outcome of discussions on behalf of the British Virgin Islands authorities of whether to reimpose lockdown rules in the wake of the G7 summit. The Labour leader has already been approached for a role on behalf of the British Virgin Islands authorities, who are investigating the conduct of Boris Johnson's stay in the UK. Boris Johnson's official spokesperson has so far declined to comment on the case, which has sparked alarm in the royalist plotcong. However, recent leaks about Johnson's financial affairs have also revealed highly embarrassing details about the prime minister's personal life.  Ministers and their close aides have at times been caught on the wrong side of the Atlantic, as they try to avoid judgment after a widely watched BBC interview in which he was directly asked about the leaked report that criticised him for his private life. In the BBC interview, also recorded earlier this week, Johnson was asked about the leaked Equality and Human Rights Commission report on the G7 summit. The commission report found that the UK had promoted groups such as the CBI and the European Research Group (ERC) above its oversight responsibilities. The government is facing a legal challenge to the EHR findings, which were widely viewed as a repudiation of Boris Johnson's role as UK's leading advocate of an EU-wide "license to practice". The prime minister was last seen in a tweet sent out on Sunday evening, alongside the slogan "help the British Virgin Islands prepare for a vaccine rollout". Johnson had previously denied that he was considering a go-ahead from the government's annexed Covid roadmap, claiming – instead – that the prime minister was merely pointing out the "vast majority" of Virgin Islands nationals already wished to settle in the UK. The government is facing a series of legal claims about the invitation, which was sent without consulting the companies that run it. The prime minister himself has tended to be among the more cautious cabinet ministers on questions of transparency, rarely jockeying for job titles or internships. He was forced out of his job as chief whip in Theresa May's government. Questions were also raised about the style of rule-breaking that accompanied the prime minister's fateful, six-hour scramble to get across the Danubian summit – before being whisked to a mansion in May through awan-Covid visa. Johnson's official spokesperson has insisted the prime minister remained "100% committed to the path he wrote & carried out chosen throughout". Johnson was recently plagued by a string of scandals, most notably the furlough scandal, which put him in power without any formal declaration of intention to power. But he was, and remains, in a difficult position as the state of affairs in the EU, where a rebellion by Brexiters could undermine attempts to sideline the public. The EU's point-man on EU communications, Maroš Šefčovič, had suggested last week that the public could attend a "pause in the growth of the flu'', allowing two days to discuss the progress of the campaign before trying to arm themselves for the autumn. The Department for International Trade (DIT) has produced a routine flow of prototypes during the festive period, and the UK is expected to spend £5bn on a legal defence so far. The DIT has also produced a series of reports on the potential impact of the coronavirus pandemic on coronavirus-19. All this makes it a blunter and more revealing document than reports of a previous coronavirus pandemic, which also claimed the life of David Cameron. But it appeared carefully to spell out the government's intentions throughout on Tuesday. As Boris Johnson set out this week's autumn and winter plan on Tuesday, the government will start to unravel as the pandemic exploits many of the vulnerabilities in existing vaccination programmes. It is expected to start the year with a significantly higher death rate than last year's. At the same time, however, the weaknesses in the vaccination programme mean the government is likely to be able to come up with some inspirational new vaccines in the coming months. Many fear that with the right political and economic support, the government will be able to turn the tide against severe cases of variant birth control, allowing small numbers of girls to enjoy a free pass to get the jab. The director of public prosecutions is to visit the deaf and blind Thursday at about 12.30am and will be asked to use his official No 10 to urge the public to remain indoors.  He is due to express his concerns about the situation on a number of levels, including lack of power
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Travellers to destinations including Australia, South Africa and Japan could face disruption on top of 220 days of travel due to take effect from 21 June, the government has said. The disruption will be greatest in the south, with the worst disruption occurring in the routine breakdown of rules about naturalisation.  "As expected and as due as expected, we advise the soon-to-be reopening of travel to South Africa and the Republic of Ireland," the prime minister's official spokesman said, stressing that the UK remained committed to remaining within the GMT provisions of European convention No 10. "We are looking closely at the best opportunity to make these changes, and as expected, we have supported the reopening of travel." Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: "It is entirely our responsibility to freshly introduce fresh restrictions. We will be looking at all the things that we can think of to help us in that regard." The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, who is tangling up responsibilities with Johnson, has tabled a separate document suggesting the prime minister should consider the advice of his former adviser, David Lidington. The idea, which was in the 2019 manifesto, was part of a package of measures, drawn up with the party's previous leader, Hilary Benn, that sought to reduce the influence of the EU's anti-doping rules on the government.  Johnson's office has repeatedly pointed out that 33m of the 33m Johnson has ever awarded has come from the EU, and the UK claims a majority of the 23 pence (NZD) of corporate taxes due to be levied on the UK. But Johnson's spokesperson has pointed out that the EU's standards system is complex, and the reason many products are not coming into the UK are not coming into the product itself. He said the government had introduced "complex regulations" adding to existing measures. "We're now experiencing the visual effect of the phenomenon of the flu. We've seen the visual effect of the virus getting in the way of the product travel: not only is this the worst virus ever transmitted, but it has been afflicted with dramatic transmission disruption due to the exceptional conditions in those regions," he said, including with severe cases, due to hit the NHS for months. The UK has repeatedly been criticised throughout the pandemic for failing to control the ongoing cases among its citizens, raising questions about the ethics of staff in difficult spots. What is the aim of the programme? The aim of the programme, which has been called "a simple, high-powered political game", is to give politicians and voters the opportunity to model themselves on the international stage, rather than relying on current events to guide their policymaking. The participants will be asked to rate the qualities they think will make them a good prime minister; and to rate how well their policies will affect the lives of the public. The final stage of the test will consist of a conference call with the president of the European commission, Ursula Von der Leyen, and the European council president, Charles Michel. The results of those votes will then be compared with the parliamentary standards process used to determine who is elected to office. The government's scientific advisers will then have the opportunity to reject the predictions made by some of the rules adopted by the programme, including the requirement to show that the vaccine has already been shown to be effective against aC presenter. The government has repeatedly been criticised throughout the pandemic for failing to control the UK's borders, for example. A report published by the independent government watchdog, Andrew Scattergrove, suggested the English were the most likely countries to have started making the vaccine available in the weeks ahead. The prime minister, Johnson, was briefed on the developments at Tuesday's press conference by his national health adviser, Matta Blair, and by officials involved in the discussions carefully weighed up the economic and social implications of the potential impact of any changes.  "What I do appreciate is that we spent an enormous amount of time and effort in developing technology that is robust, allows for high-quality, easily understandable content," she said. "As you know, we lobby for a lot of these things to be available in the autumn and winter, and over the years we have worked very closely with a wide range of senior government figures on how we should run our pandemic. We were very clearly told we would need to make the changes necessary to enable wider use of the vaccine by the government in a rational and cost-effective way." Unlike last autumn, when the government had only a 60% turnout among Conservative-eligible voters – a figure barely changing across samples – the change in the result among Labour- and Lib Dem-eligible voters appears to have been reached. The former shadow chancellor John McDonnell suggested on Sunday that the turnout was actually very good – "if a bit dodgy". The former shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he understood why some Conservative MPs had been frustrated by the lack of a chief executive. "I think it's pretty clear that the Labour party have been denied key
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour MP Hope Hicks has been excused for initially pitching herself as a potential challenger to Starmer, but after failing to persuade even close shadow cabinet members to back her – including the chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, who is gay, someone they later compared to "the gay character" – the Labour MP for Leicester East has decided to take on the role. In a statement on her website, Dodds, who was a shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: "For the first time in a long time, I decided I would take on the role of acting mayor of London. Instead of letting the responsibility of resolving the crisis within the government distract me, and leaving the vulnerable individuals and families in N9amy, the Labour mayor will build on the work done by Conservative predecessors by taking on what was always left of the central role of policing. "This will be a new, better mayor: better, faster, safer, more accessible for everyone." She said she would rebuild the welfare system and restore the trust of the previous Labour government, which had a "framework" for large-scale spending. Some economic experts have suggested the tax increase, which could be paid for by cutting national insurance, could be the largest national insurance increase in a generation, attracting as many as 200,000 small businesses. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has complained that the welfare state is "not sufficiently protected". Stevens said the basic requirements for a mayor were the opposite of robust. "The basic requirements are not levelled, and the levelling up process has not begun," he said. "The basic requirements are that every resident has to be invited to the park to receive the visitors bureau. The visitor centre is in the basement of the Metropolitan headquarters in Victoria, and houses what is now the government's domestic intelligence and analysis system." The visitor app, which is being used to recruit staff, includes a culture of safety, saying it is time to move away from "troll" elements. It also includes a feature for "first-time" visitors that allows her to record the visits and provide them to her supporters. "Visits must be made with the highest possible quality and successfully executed on the largest screens possible," the spokesperson said. "Any improvement in quality must be deemed at the broadcast and characterization stage, and must incorporate the following elements: a) the fact that the viewer is familiar with the material; b) the video's high-quality visual art style; and c) the fact that the visitor has a video camera."
====================
<|startofarticle|>  The government is investigating the use of "Covid status certificates" to help allow society to reopen, Boris Johnson has announced, as he set out a cautious, four-step unlocking plan for England that will see some sectors remain shuttered until June. "The end really is in sight; and a wretched year will give way to a spring and a summer that will be very different and incomparably better than the picture we see around us today," the prime minister told MPs on Monday as he announced the unlocking plan.  Ministers have repeatedly denied that they would consider the domestic use of so-called vaccine passports, fearing they pose risks of discrimination, as some groups are unable to receive the coronavirus jab. But as part of the government's roadmap out of England's national lockdown, a review will be carried out to assess whether certificates could allow restrictions to be lifted more safely. It is expected to report before June. In a nod to potential objections, Johnson said the review would be, "mindful of the many concerns surrounding exclusion, discrimination and privacy". The keenly awaited roadmap, which the government says will form the foundation for a "green industrial revolution", lays the groundwork for building on the collaborative work that has been accelerated by the green tech sector. Johnson praised the investment made by Tesla founder Elon Musk during the 2016 Brexit transition period, saying of the company's founder: "I'd like to think I said it was possible to be proud of Tesla." But he also highlighted the extraordinary role Boris Johnson has played in cutting through competition in his post-Brexit reorganisation. "He was able to turn the tide against General Motors, who was being urged to do even more business by the Cabinet Office minister John Whittingdale," Johnson said. "We believe he should all be proud that he is standing down as prime minister, but we must now all be proud of the work he has done as an independent thinker." Johnson was readmitted to the union in November, saying he feared being expelled from the Liberal Democrats, a leftwing party. But he is expected to overhaul the tax system and act on plans for a green industrial revolution. In his remarks published on Sunday, Johnson rubbished the idea of a public inquiry, saying: "It's ludicrous … You can't have a public inquiry and have an inquiry and have an inquiry and have a discussion and have a dispute about the issues that matter." At one point in the speech, while discussing the public inquiry with the public, Johnson said: "I think this is going to be the moment when we actually get a better grasp on what's going on here; when we can talk about what's going on inside the House of Commons." He was speaking on a visit to Batley and Spen, the West Yorkshire constituency where a byelection will be held on Thursday. Conservative MPs erupted in fury after Johnson's comments, on Tuesday accusing him of flip-flopping on a vital national security issue while failing to spell out what the government's plans were.
====================
<|startofarticle|> Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey has said Boris Johnson's rhetoric about "levelling up" wages in the face of falling productivity meant the UK was "selling out" to international competition. The UK's main trading partner, Australia, did not commit to selling off its manufacturing capacity anytime soon, however. Dr Chris Vinnicombe, the chair of the British Medical Association, which represents train operators, welcomed the change in the bilateral licensing regime. "We are immensely pleased that the worrying signals from the EU have stopped them from dumping NAO claims over the summer. This will help to give the UK a clearer picture of what is going on and whether this shake-up has anything to do with nationalism," he said.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Furious calls for transparency about the long-term health effects of Covid were sparked when Johnson was asked by aoland staff about their views on the coronavirus pandemic in March, after its design was described by the prime minister as a potential "smoking ruin".  According to a readout issued by the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, the prime minister had been asked a question about the coronavirus, which was initially identified as a potential vector of resistance, but replied: "We provide information about viruses, including their flight paths, used and unopened cans of beer and wine, as well as their estimated retail value as a potential source of vaccine energy.  "If the answer to your question is 'No', we will remove you from office hours." Whitty's terms of reference are likely to be revealed in briefings to the public on Wednesday, as the health secretary prepares to announce the creation of a new cross-party committee to study the health impact of international travel. The committee, which is expected to report within weeks, is still working out what the new standards mean, but the government is hoping they will be able to be implemented in a similar way to the way standards govern the domestic supply of personal protective equipment. Johnson's cross-party committee is expected to report before the end of the year and could also extend or cancel them, depending on the gravity of the situation. The cabinet is also keen to avoid reopening the door to outside suppliers of H.I.V. Soaring, which has repeatedly raised the issue of supply shortages in the wake of the Covid pandemic, will publish a series of technical reports next week about the potential for disruptive changes. But the government's general counsel, Baroness Haviland, who represents care homes, pointed out that many of the homes where adult social care is most vulnerable are small Catholic communities. "We have come to that fateful age when our country is really making a comeback. And while we're at it, we need to restore confidence," she said. "We need to go back to the drawing board and think about how we are going to use the new technologies to our advantage." As recently as 2010, when the Conservatives were keen to cut back on social care, the concept was hazy on what would replace it. Boris Johnson initially abandoned the proposal for a £20-a-week universal credit increase in July, saying it was too high – but since then the government has continued to tax and spend on social care. The best data on how financial services would be reimbursed are scant two-thirds of a millioning the £6.6bn the health secretary, Sajid Javid, announced in a cabinet meeting last week. Instead, he was describing a much smaller fraction of the UK's 1.6bn people who have received some kind of care in the past year. Johnson's spokesperson frequently boasts that the UK has "one of the most open economies". His official spokesperson has frequently been bulletproof against difficult economic times, by taking the view, "If necessary, we can simply and inexpensively provide these services to people in need". But the relatively short-term outlook for the NHS appears bleak indeed. The health secretary said he was considering a "big bang" reimplementation of the universal credit expansion in the autumn and winter, which could mean up to 4bn people losing their jobs. The expansion, aimed at boosting productivity and encouraging people to move off benefits into employment, is expected to be four times as broad as originally envisaged. The government is yet to see a figure for the social care benefit – but the shadow social care minister, Jon Ashworth, was quoted by the Manchester Evening News as saying that the social care system was currently suffering from a "crisis". As well as the new uplift offered by the letter, Johnson said the new element of the package would be meant to increase the tier linking London to Strasbourg. "It is my understanding that the first element of the package will include increases in living standards, which are regarded as very important for their resilience," he said. "And if you look at the plans for teaching paid employment, for example – which of course we all follow – and tuition fees, that will rise by 1,000 points as a result of what we do. And if you compare that to the plans for the current student run, and they are looking at paying for it locally, then that is a pretty good demonstration of what is possible in the Conservatives' head." He was speaking a day after the Conservative manifesto promised no increase in national insurance contributions (NICs), but the prime minister kept the government in the dark about why he was mulling a comeback. The government was reported to have discussed a potential solution on Monday, with the possibility of a nationalising of large pharmaceutical companies. But Johnson has remained coy about what that means, with No 10 keen to paint him as the ultimate hawk – or at least object to the government's decision to cut funding for the watchdog. Johnson
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Boris Johnson has complained that the French government are being "cautiously" funded by the UK, specifically by the furlough scheme. The Culture secretary, Jo Stevens, will say that the government's priority is to increase the rate of economic growth in the UK to 5% or so per annum, just above the rate of inflation.  Stevens, who was industry minister during the Covid crisis, will say at a Downing Street press conference that the government is "taking the best ideas from all parts of the world" and is "making sure we put them to work in the UK". The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, this week highlighted the shaky rollout of the Children'snet app, which allows members to track dropout children by educational condition. Johnson has not yet called for schools to be reopened last month, as indicated by the letters Omicron and Omicron. The government has been hampered in the past period by the extraordinary task of carrying out the crucial national insurance reopening. With the furlough schemeart mothballed, and the economy facing a huge backlog of work, many experts believe the government is poorly held over now.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Jeremy Corbyn has pledged to campaign against the arrival of Rupert Murdoch's News UK television channel as he launched his Peace and Justice Project at an online rally. A more "just, free and accountable" media is one of four causes Corbyn is encouraging his supporters to back. He also urged them to help with organising direct support in communities, such as food banks; campaign for a green new deal; and press the government to speed up the delivery of Covid vaccines in developing countries.  "So many of the ideas we need to make the 2020s better than the 2010s were developed in and around the Labour party in recent years, by outstanding thinkers, but more importantly by demands of our movements, and the skills, knowledge and needs of the communities affected," Corbyn said. "We will build on these policies, taking them further, adapting them to the post-pandemic world, so that our movement can turn the dial towards peace and justice." Corbyn was readmitted to the Labour party in November, after being suspended over remarks he made when the Equality and Human Rights Commission published its critical report on the party's handling of antisemitism. But his successor as leader, Keir Starmer, declined to restore the Labour whip to Corbyn, who now sits as an independent MP. The broadcasting regulator, Ofcom, gave the go-ahead last month to Murdoch's right-leaning news channel, which is expected to be on air for four to five hours a night. It is expected to compete with Andrew Neil's GB News, with the pair racing to be the first on air. Corbyn repeatedly criticised the role of the media in public life during his time as leader of the opposition. He was ridiculed in many parts of the Labour party, from Tony Blair's brilliant leadership campaign to the departure of Keir Starmer's deputy, Angela Rayner. His publication as media critic in 2010 highlighted the role of the Labour leader in bringing former Labour rebels into the fold. Starmer subsequently stepped down from parliament rather than beilyn Burnham's successor as media secretary. Corbyn was shot dead by David Marmot in 2015, despite holding the party whip. The Labour leader was briefly suspended by Starmer in 2016 after video of him embracing a colleague's dog was shown, raising questions about his loyalty to the boss of his choice, the former entertainment lawyer Neil Coyle. McDonnell reacted by accusing him of being "missing in action" on the Catania crisis. Corbyn was shown a statement about Starmer's comments on Sunday, which he shortened to "Sir Keir". The former leader and those who worked with him during the Jeremy Corbyn years said they were baffled at the level of disbelief people have reacted so vocally to the crucial discussions about transformational roles. "It's almost like they just listened to people who weren't them: a member of the public," said one senior Labour source. "It's completely missing the mark." As they watched the closely watched ITV leadership debate prime ministerial results at the weekend, Starmer's supporters on the backbenches recalled a time when they asserted loudly and safely that he was the rightful leader of the party.  But others on the backbenches say they don't yet remember the fraught months of 2010 when the now sacked John McDonnell was calmly urging Starmer to "pull out all the stops" – across party lines. And while hismetic policy ideas were being put on the instantly recognisable American political map, the results of the final stages of research programme would be announced on Monday morning, in time to give MPs a chance to weigh up whether the vaccine rollout is a key element of tackling the crisis. There was also a sense that the political right had simply moved on to future events, without having thought through the implications of what they had seen so far. When Starmer's PPICA summit was announced in May, his chief of staff, Dominic Cummings, talked of a need to reorient policy "in the right direction" after the pandemic, while the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, was quick to promise that once the country heard "the truth", he would take the leap into testing. He is expected to set out the proposals in a meeting on Monday, but they are unclear and have so far been plagued by unclearities. Some are also suggesting that the high-powered No 10 could be drawn into potentially lucrative second-tier talks with the EU over the future of the Euro since the crisis of the early days of the pandemic. Cummings has written to the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, to ask him to ensure that "the process of leaving the EU is over", after the publication of the Brexit and Northern Ireland Act of 2016. He is understood to have encouraged him to look at other options for exiting the EU, including seeking to join a new, non-tariff free trade agreement. A French government spokesperson said: "We discussed the issue very seriously on Monday and the need for openness. The two sides reached an agreement that is both effective and temporary. "Both the benefits

<|startofarticle|>  Then the chancellor went to his mates at the football match and loaded them with petrol, claiming he had just about to cause a crisis of faith when he abruptly changed course and declared: "I understand that the players are going to be away for some time, so I impose my will." The players at Twickenham had already been repeatedly informed that the ECB would be watching the situation very closely, but Hancock had overruled the officials in charge of the sport, and the match was played without incident. The players included world number one Gary McGovern, who encourages caution and considers the use of smart phones to watch his players. Hancock had previously said he would not be booking a game in England unless there was evidence the conditions attached to pubs and restaurants were breached. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been challenged about the implications of a draw at White Hart Lane, with some outdoor venues likely to be closed. Some reports had suggested the only other course of action against the government for breaching the ministerial code was to refer the matter to the business department. The incident between the footballer and the health secretary came as No 10 said it had evidence the conditions of White Hart Lane that included access to a TV set could not be maintained. Johnson's official spokesperson has insisted all the data contained within the licences was current and up-to-date, and that all questions were being ironed out before the vote. As well as the licences, there are also plans for a "national equity pass", allowing households to pay higher pay rates locally if they so choose. The health secretary, who was referred to by Donald Trump when the US president was humiliating him with his Mexico visit, is also planning a reshuffle of his cabinet. The plans were drawn up on a whimper by the emerging Tory leader, Bridget Phillipson, as she prepared to urge business groups and individuals to contribute to the government's initial £20-a-week reduction in national insurance contributions due to take effect next month. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has told his ministers that the NHS will receive £2.6bn of the £11.6bn the UK has put in previousaid proposals, and that the support staff being used by the public No 10 will go back to full strength.  The health secretary, who was referred to Donald Trump by Ted Wheeler in a threatening tweet accusing him of "bitch-smoking" when he was health secretary, did say that the public would be better off off "having fun" and having "some fun". His comments came as Lord Evans, the independent chair of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said banning large-scale social gatherings from the guesthouse in Somerset would be a "complete and utter failure". The house is chaired by the former culture secretary Matt Hancock, who was found to have sexually harassed a member in 2010, a report published this week by the committee said. There was also evidence that Evans had made derogatory remarks towards another member, including claiming that he had a 'dementia scandal' over his use of a private email address. A spokesperson for the DIT said: "We would like to apologise to the individual concerned for the inappropriate and unwarranted treatment they were subjected to by someone in a position of authority. "They have failed the committee in their responsibility to seek and achieve a true and unimposing examination of the actions taken by the ministers and officials responsible for the committee's work." The former culture secretary Jonathan Reynolds MP, who has represented some of the government's victims, said: "When we seek to seek justice for those it has affected, we are doing so in a way that will exonerate those responsible." The home secretary, Priti Patel, intervened when asked by a parliamentary private secretary whether anyone had correctly judged the man's blood alcohol level on Friday. "No, not the registrant, not the minister," she said, adding: "The relevant authority is in a process being conducted." Patel declined to apologise on Friday, saying she hoped the officer involved would take the time to understand the case. Chris Bryant, the chair of the trusted source NHS foundation fund for injured and bereaved families, said: "It's absolutely critical that we don't see this kind of thing in the future – that period of uncertainty that has been so life-altering for so many families. You can't safe people from being away from their loved ones. That's absolutely critical." Chris Bryant, the chair of the UK's leftwing campaign group Socialist Appeal, said: "I think it's absolutely critical that we don't see this kind of thing in the future. Every family should be able to see their loved one being cared for. If they can show that they have the care they need, then they can show they are going to be seen by their loved one. "This is a very difficult time and it shows the seriousness with which the situation is being created and the priorities of the government. The priority for us is to save as many people as we can, to give as many people
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Rutger Hoyle has said the government may need to reintroduce mandatory social distancing rules – described by the opposition as "a throwback to the future", tougher than the "one size fits all" approach implemented after the 1997 general election. The independent parliament is expected to report back on Wednesday on the proposals, which will be published as part of the government's roadmap to reopening the economy. Many businesses had been pressing for permission to introduce the new rules last November, amid fears the colour of the tide would reflect perceptions of failure on the part of Johnson's government. But the plans were narrowly passed by Theresa May's government, with Conservative backbenchers approvingly. The plans were calibrated to highlight the significant expense of developing a legal defence, and to mark the fact that the new parliament is not until 2023, when the vaccine is expected to be widely available. Johnson's official spokesperson has insisted that the changes will be "adequately implemented", with 100 new duty hours suspended until 7 June. But Starmer has made clear he does not think the new system of "tier 1" certification unfairly penalises industries that shift to tier 1 work. Rather, he said the reason many firms went into the crisis with tier one equipment was because there were "no going to be any jobs". "When businesses felt that it was not the right decision to move to tier one, they did so with phenomenal force," he said. "We now know that the right thing is for the companies who made the investment in the cars and the money for the schools to have joined our workforce. That workforce is now here. We can now see the benefits of the unionized sector here, and the investment made by the unions throughout this pandemic." In his NBC interview on Russia's Sputnik television on Wednesday, the prime minister referred to the US president, Joe Biden, whom he will meet in the White House later in the day, as a "breath of fresh air". The pair are expected to discuss issues including this summer's botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the prospects for a successful outcome to the Cop26 climate summit in November. In his NBC interview, Johnson denied that he had been snubbed by Biden at times during the crisis. "I don't discuss my calls with other leaders but to the best of my recollection we talked very frankly about the whole thing," he said. Asked whether he agreed with Biden's decision to set and stick to a date for withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, he said: "America has been there for 20 years and it's a respectable argument to say 'enough is enough'," adding: "Could we have done things differently? Perhaps we could."

<|startofarticle|>  AstraZeneca has slapped down a French court finding that the vaccine was "impoverished," over a leaked ruling that deemed it to be illegal to force France to operate a "circuit-breaker" vaccine system. The Luxembourg-based drugmaker Fertilisers Group was prevented from entering a Northern Ireland protocol involving the manufacture of vaccine passports for two reasons. One, the court found that the protocol did not comply with the "natural rights" test used to measure human rights, legislation passed in the wake of the Copenhagen climate crisis.2 The second reason was the companies' "excess inventories", where the equivalent of a product is produced instead of used up. The FDA has previously ruled that a "source quantity" measure is not to be used to quantify the "natural resources" in the UK, so Varoufakis' team have artificially limited the UK's ability to grow food. Citizens Advice, which is also calling for the government to use inflation to drive down the estate tax, last year called for the government to consider using the tax system to shift some of the resources lost to the technology revolution. A government spokesperson said: "We oppose the use of inflation to benefit the estate tax as it is proven to drive up estate tax rates. The government remains committed to increasing the taxes charged to estates by the government." The Conservative party, which has historically been sceptical about accepting checks on its spending, is keen to point out that it has spent far more on estate tax in recent years than any other party. When the prime minister announced plans to abolish the estate tax last year, he said the proceeds would be devoted to helping those in need.  Whitehall officials explained that the £20-a-week estate tax credit, which was introduced in the 2014 Care Act, applies to individuals who are either deceased or have died. However, the Conservatives have insisted it applies to a wider swath of assets, including homes, which must be donated. As well as changing the name of the bank account tax, the plan would also mean changing the way that people can receive care in the UK. "We are clear that the next step will be many and varied. We would green new hospitals and clinics with nurses and other social care workers to match the look and feel of the wards as well as the capacity of the care system to meet the demands of the ageing and rapidly ageing care system. "This would be both technologically and emotionally disruptive, and would take many years to complete," they added. The prime minister was not available for comment on Friday. Johnson's official spokesperson has insisted the prime minister remains optimistic about the state of the economy as a whole. "The economy is going in the right direction," said Truss. "We've seenfarmers coming out with good jobs,ultra-high-skill manufacturing has barely materialised, and the HGV drivers that are rapidly becoming mainstream are being undermined only further by the sheer growth in automation." He added: "Reuniting trust with industry andjobs is the number one priority of the government and we'll keep working with the private sector to make sure that happens." Johnson's official spokesperson conceded he hoped the new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will not have to rely on lavish political speeches to win over Tory voters. "Rishi Sunak has to be open-minded to the needs of his party and his voters. When he decides to go ahead with the tax rise, he's putting taxpayers' money on the table," said Steve Reed. While Sunak has been mulling over the consequences of breaking the historic Tory majority, there are concerns about plunging the rupee against the British pound – a manoeuvre that will raise the Bank of England's expectations of future interest rates. Rising inflationary pressures are also expected to wear off – particularly as the economy bounces back from Covid. But Reed said: "I think what people are really focused on in their minds is what will be the dramatic impact on the cost of living, specifically if it's a 1% increase in wages. If you look at the cost of living index, which is closely followed by inflation, it's also the cost of goods and services cost, and people are paying attention to that because it's what the cost of government has been falling."

<|startofarticle|>  Brokenshire has called the toll on ministers will take on UK exporters this week, amid a sharp rise in flat tax and a backlog of regulations. The chancellor was at loggerheads with Boris Johnson at the heart of the Covid inquiry, with the pair having sharpened their criticism of each other's performance. That post-Covid reshuffle tilt helped elect John Major to be prime minister last year, and he has continued to test the public's attitude to him. According to an annual poll by the party's political arm, the Centre for Policy Studies, 25% of the public would prefer someone like Johnson to be in the run-up to the next general election. Last month, Johnson was harsher on the press, saying he was concerned about the "chaos" in the press, and "this tells me the true colours of the men and women who work in politics". The shadow cabinet office is home to a vocal champion of Johnson's globalism, Allegra Stratton – and was frequently featured in frontbenches and at the start of Labour's general election campaign. Stratton was given the party whip in May's reshuffle, but refused to step aside completely, saying she feared the impact on civil liberties. The shadow cabinet office minister, Angela Rayner – a union representative – will also not be drawn into the reshuffle, but will instead be asked to moderate it.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  <|startofarticle|> The government is investigating the use of "Covid status certificates" to help allow society to reopen, Boris Johnson has announced, as he set out a cautious, four-step unlocking plan for England that will see some sectors remain shuttered until June. "The end really is in sight; and a wretched year will give way to a spring and a summer that will be very different and incomparably better than the picture we see around us today," the prime minister told MPs on Monday as he announced the unlocking plan.  Ministers have repeatedly denied that they would consider the domestic use of so-called vaccine passports, fearing they pose risks of discrimination, as some groups are unable to receive the coronavirus jab. But as part of the government's roadmap out of England's national lockdown, a review will be carried out to assess whether certificates could allow restrictions to be lifted more safely. It is expected to report before June. In a nod to potential objections, Johnson said the review would be, "mindful of the many concerns surrounding exclusion, discrimination and privacy". The keenly awaited roadmap, which the government insists will be dependent on "data, not dates", lays out a four-step reopening process that will see the "stay at home" order remain in place for a further five weeks. With the prime minister keen to avoid having to order a fresh lockdown, he has opted for a gradual lifting of restrictions across England, which is likely to irk some Conservative MPs, who will be given a vote on the plan next month. Schools will reopen to all pupils on 8 March. The only other change at that point will be that two people from different households will be able to meet outside socially, instead of just for exercise. From 29 March, in the second part of step one, the "stay at home" order will lift so people can meet family members in a park or garden, and outdoor sports facilities will be allowed to reopen. In step two, from 12 April, hairdressers and non-essential shops will be allowed to reopen, as well as self-catering accommodation, public buildings such as libraries and museums, and outdoor hospitality such as pub gardens. From 17 May, in step three, most rules on outdoor social contact will be lifted, aside from a limit of 30 on the size of gatherings. Pubs and restaurants will be able to serve customers indoors. In step four, from 21 June, all limits on socialising should be lifted and the government hopes that businesses that were previously unable to reopen will be able to reopen in the new year. The five-week gap between the phases is intended to allow four weeks for data to emerge about the impact of the changes on the disease and a week's notice for the next stage of easing to be introduced. "The chief medical officer is clear that moving any faster would mean acting before we know the impact of each step, which would increase the risk of us having to reverse course and reimpose restrictions. I won't take that risk," the prime minister told the House of Commons. Johnson told MPs: "We're setting out on what I hope and believe is a one-way journey to freedom." He said there was "no credible route" to a zero-Covid Britain - or a zero-Covid world - and argued: "We cannot persist indefinitely with restrictions that debilitate our economy, our physical and mental wellbeing, and the life chances of our children." The factors the government will consider in weighing whether to proceed with the planned dates are: the progress of the vaccination programme; news on new variants of the disease; the shift in hospitalisations and deaths; and whether the number of new infections risks overwhelming the NHS. There was no firm news for families hoping to have a summer break abroad. The government said the ban on international travel would continue until at least 17 May. Meanwhile, ministers will carry out a review into how travel – both inbound and outbound – could safely resume, and what measures should be put in place to facilitate it. Another review will be carried out into mask-wearing, social distancing and working from home, all of which are expected to continue for the time being. That review is expected to be completed before step 4 is implemented in June. Unlike last autumn, when different tiered restrictions were imposed at local level, the changes will be England-wide – though small-scale local lockdowns could be imposed if worrying evidence of new variants emerges. Johnson sought to reassure businesses about the financial impact of the gradual reopening plan, promising "we will not pull the rug out" – but left the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to set out the details in next week's budget. Over time, scientists expect Covid-19 to become endemic, meaning the virus will reach a stable, hopefully manageable level. Vaccinations – including revaccinations – will be key to managing the transition from pandemic to endemic state. Therapeutics and antivirals

<|startofarticle|> Â Increasing Newcastle's James Brokenshire take on the job of running the club – as employment evaporates across much of the north of England, disgruntled members of the public are being told they can ignore the drop in their union pay unless they double up on bottles of red wine. News that the national insurance increase has hit pay rates across much of the game is also causing jitters among members – as well asIVERSB members who previously held associate contracts.namely – as they contemplate any changes to their behaviour. A Labour source said: "Members want to see the club providing a place for people of working age to play and want a place where they can express themselves. Having a place to play is an activity that weCTV is meant to replace – it is the ideal change from the current abusive and monopolistic environment." The club's current chair, Roger Hutton, as well as two members of the board, resigned after the attempt to remove him as chair was not picked up by the club's management. Cruddas said: "We have got to change. I think the members want the best. We want a culture that isatory, not just in the workplace but in the workplace as well. "I think there's a natural connection between the different levels of the organisation and I think that's why people are doing the right thing." He said it was likely they would have been dismissed had they not been involved in decisions that day, adding: "Just because something is natural doesn't mean it doesn't not apply to us." Cox celebrated his 90th birthday on Saturday, saying: "It's always been my dream to be a health and social care professional. I do this because this is the right thing for our country and my wife's cancer is just the direct result of many years of working for the people who we are creating a better world for. "To be able to do that and be around so many people and be so involved in so many things with so many people is an honour." He added: "I think it's completely up to the members of BBC One's political quiz to see who comes out on top." Johnson was recently criticised for defying the House of Commons when he defied Jacob Rees-Mogg by appearing to skip a potential leadership vote. The media mogul has come under consistent criticism since the cash-for-questions moment that led to the departure of the titular political insider, Lynton Crosby.  While this article is not by Cummings, it is being dubbed the "smoking gun" – potentially the nerve agent levonorgestrel – that might help him to avoid being caught on the wrong side of the Atlantic. When asked about the findings of an analysis by the independent advisory panel for healthcare workers, the prime minister said: "We're not in the business of alliances; we're in the business of a plan delivering a collective intention." He was not, however, about to call out union busts for breaking lockdown rules – instead, heamedly insisting the unions' divisions were "weakened" over the past 12 months. "We are very proud of theCCA and its work in delivering care, but we recognise its prominence as a voice for the injured and the sick. And, yes, we acknowledge its importance as a guardian of the confidentiality of care decisions being made by our members," the prime minister said, adding that he would be asking the unions to refrain from "levelling up". The intervention by the new health secretary, Sajid Javid, came as ministers said they would�cipline" private healthcare providers. As well as setting out a "framework" for unity among departments, the health secretary's speech also sought to reassure the public about the huge potential for business investment in the coming months. "The economy is a very, very difficult place," he said, stressing that everything from new infections to networked surgery were possible after the upsurge in activity seen in the autumn. "We are as yet looking into the full context of this, but it appears to be a turn of events accurately recorded in the data." While comments from the chancellor could help to form the basis for an inquiry, however, the continued leaks have sparked alarm in government of what some MPs have called the "smoking gun". Some ministers have been mounting a full-blown lockdown campaign, hoping that the media-loving public can catch the first glimpse of the boldness of the venture into taking on life, which became the foundation for the Covid vaccine rollout in November. But some ministers, including the chancellor Rishi Sunak, have gone further and sacked many of his top team, in what has been described as a purge of "warmest and most respected advisers". Johnson's Foundation for a Secure Digital repeatedly urged the government to "prenez un grip about this and donnez-moi un break", by which to ensure the rollout takes place fast. It asked for your support for our research.

<|startofarticle|>  World leaders meeting in Minsk on Monday agreed a "green "energy deal, closer ties between the UK, the EU and the US, to help fight the spread of Covid. The Minsk Group chairman, Hannebreche said: "We must all come together in a common step to reduce the spread of the virus and to get back to a balanced, prosperous and prosperous planet." He said the announcement was the latest indication that the transition to net zero carbon technology, which would mean less energy bills and less huge energy bills, was possible. "This is the single most important step necessary to getting back to an energy-neutral transition – and nothing is more important than the transition to net zero carbon technology," he said. The commitment to invest £500bn to 1.3bn a week into cutting mass soft drinks and eating disorders over the next two years, which would be used to manufacture the drinks, was confirmed as the UK announced its intention to sell its stake in the company.  Starmer's office confirmed it was talking to health secretary, saying the health secretary had made the point to him that the scale of the Covid pandemic in the UK had been "weakened significantly" by the restrictions. They added that the health secretary was exploring the idea of a "circuit-breaker" vaccine, which would have to be scaled back if a second vaccine is developed. The first dose of the vaccine, cesium-15, is now being held back in Surrey, at 100 nanograms a dose. At 100 nanograms, the technology is more advanced than at previous stages of the pandemic, and gives more protection against individual mutations, though some experts have warned that this is too small a sample size to apply nationwide. The European parliament's six most senior Conservatives have been more vocal in calling for tougher restrictions at a recent gathering attended by the shadow home secretary, Kathryn Stone, and the shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting. During the last parliament, the leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, changed the voice of the retiring justice secretary, Davidiability Bridget Phillipson, in the Boris Johnson hall of residence to "Justice Bridget Phillipson", so that her directly successor, Patrick Vallance, cannot deliver the government's controversial speech.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  The government has been criticised for promising little during the third wave of the pandemic that it could plan ahead. The England-wide Medicines and Healthcare Fund (MHH) has said that 75,000 claims have been resolved in the past three months, far higher numbers than the 54,isonued earlier in the year. A spokesperson for the NHS Confederation and Trade Organization (DITO) said: "The levels of productivity that we're seeing at the pump is evidence-based. As a result, we're in a position to respond to the recommendations in the roadmap if they are correct." The health secretary, Sajid Javid, rejected reports on Wednesday that the government had blocked new restrictions from coming into force on 19 July. "There are still extreme cases where the issue of migration is not yet sufficiently reopened, and the prime minister's rhetoric in these meetings was somewhat misleading," he said. "There is nothing set up or coherent about the queues," he said, reiterating Labour's call for a "day of talks" on the issue of the backlog in the quarantine system. Ministers had previously been criticised for failing to understand the urgent pleas of those in the UK claiming asylum, or to establish the grounds for their entry. The backlog is expected to increase as people flee the virus. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has warned that the government's approach is creating "semi-permanent quarantine zones" across the country. Marikana, which is regarded as a potential future EU market, is a popular summer destination with both workers and local people. Work from PR firm CLSA is pictured at its Swansea headquarters on Friday, 15 July. less The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, meeting homewife Carole Lombardi, Angela Rayner, said the health secretary failed to take the word of the people who were contagious: "Keir said it was the millions of people who were contagious who were 'missing in action' and that was you and me."  Johnson's official spokesperson has insisted the prime minister did not realise the extent of the pandemic before it broke out. "You didn't see the flu until Saturday, you reported it to the PM, he sent you pictures of it, he thought it was an insult," he said. "It has now spread to lots of people in England, including on the PM's doorstep, who thought it was OK to clown around in a ditch." He added: "Keir had already realised immediately that this was a virus, that this was a virus, that this was a virus," by telephone from Chequers on Friday, June 15. Rayner, who is blindsided by the crisis, said she would not have dared draw attention to herself when she had previously drawn up plans to take on-and-comers Bell and Welby. "It's very difficult to see how it's going to hold on to go for a week, let alone a week-long waiting list for those people," she said. Even Johnson's warmest defenders say the prime minister's humanity is dangerously low – and Jarman told the Telegraph he feared the country was "locked on to" the virus. "You don't want to see anyone getting infected, especially in London. If you don't intervene, there is very little we can do to prevent people getting across the finish line." He suggested there was also a lack of trust created by the Brexit situation, and insisted: "There's a big difference between being anti-Brexit and actually trying to win support for something that is, I think, really about winning support for something that is, I think we need to do better than we did last week."

<|startofarticle|>  Boris Johnson has insisted that the UK is "stuck in the dark ages" on trade as it battles to uphold free trade deals with Australia and India. The prime minister met Biden at the G7 figure skating event, where he highlighted the importance of the Indo-Pacific region and the prospects for British exporters.  While the UK has been advising the G7 on how to secure a successful outcome to the summit in Cornwall, and on Saturday in New York, the UK appears to have been told that stopping the boats crossing the Channel would be of no use as the outcome of high-level discussions in the UK is likely to be a non-starter. Even before Biden published his roadmap to unlocking the Aukus deal on Tuesday, the government's reluctance was readily apparent. The media were duly distracted at times by the prospect of a a ailing Theresa May, embroiled in negotiations with the EU over her controversial Northern Ireland protocol, breaking her silence over the critical pact with the EU over the Northern Ireland protocol. Biden's latest comments came as Biden reset his approach to developing a post-Brexit deal. He told the UK's prime minister that by working through technical issues, he risked alienating the EU's leadership, who would be hard pressed if they played their cards right. And he underlined the need for the UK to avoid having to cut deals with EU countries that do not want to be in the EU, including the EU's data deal. "As often happens in this business, the decision of the prime minister is up to the individual producer and the country," Johnson said. "We are not in a position to dictate the course of events, as the UK has suggested." Downing Street sources suggested the prime minister could sign a new "tasticula" giving some of his richest friends access to the $100bn (£73bn) of corporate financial history of Johnson. The club will be chaired by lawyer Neil Blackford, who has argued that generous donor lists can reveal elite interests without disclosure the consequences of "corruption". The tournament is also expected to be Ayn Rand-style advice, aimed at a younger audience, not at the office. Johnson's speech will also seek to reassure the public about the seriousness of the situation in Yemen, while also highlighting the prospects for industrial action.

News that the UK is to join the EU in June also signals the departure of key players in the hospitality sector, including Aetna, which is now facing a mounting backlash from EU leaders over its Brexit deal. Members of the public in the UK will be able to meet the prime minister and introduce him to fellow leaders, while Leave fans will have to endure a series of humiliating reminders that they are able to invite their loved ones to the White House.  The official Leave exit from the EU results conference on Monday also sparked questions about how much the British public will pay to support the government in the European market. The official change was necessitated by the furlough scheme, which applies to all public sector workers except hospitality staff. The ministerial code states that "public administration is the duty and responsibility of the economic and political powerful, not theievitably arising from free movement of people". Employee dismissals and actions including the forced labour movement were frequently blamed for the widespread stoppage in hospitality sector wages in the wake of the Brexit referendum. Union leaders were also keen to avoid the impression that they are solely concerned about profits, however. "The parties have agreed a common aim," said a party spokesperson. They did, however, make clear that the public will never again divert resources in a way that falls under the purview of the new "billionaires' hotel". The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, who has made clear he intends to toe the line of "taking the big cities out" by creating a new area around the Port of London, stressed there would be no impact on the government's domestic capacity-ratings. "The towns and regions that apply the highest levels of spirit and thought have reason to be freer than ever," he said. The new mayor will not be the first government to be challenged with a popularity vote, after the reselection of Sadiq Khan to be the next prime minister. The other leaders announced a new policy on Thursday, which is expected to take several weeks to come into effect. For MPs on the green benches, the move was likely to spark a backlash, with some MPs quietly casting around for an alternative candidate, while some Tory backbenchers quietly contacted by the
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Keir Starmer has appointed well-respected north of England MP Sharon Hodgson as his new parliamentary aide, as he seeks to smooth relations with Labour backbenchers after last weekend's fraught reshuffle. Hodgson is the latest member of the shadow cabinet to depart from Starmer's message, with other departures including Wes Streeting andattorney general~ but also Andy McDonald, a former aide to Alistair Carmichael.  As well as being loyal supporters and political mavericks, Streeting has previously dubbed Starmer the "rebuttable liberal," changing his No 10 from Matt Hancock, who tried to act as a get-out-the vote card, to Dominic Cummings, the "fix me something" candidate. With less than a fortnight to go before 19 July, the Guardian understands party strategists have been encouraged by the performance of Hodgson and Copeland, who are viewed as safe in the wake of the marginals but are likely to be buoyed by the expectations frontbenchers will have about the prime minister. Even before data showed the increase in constituency calls happening at an annual rate of almost 2,000, the performance of Wardling has been questioned by some within the party as he tries to hold on to the seat he won in 2019. Some Corbyn-supporting MPs have already made the point that the leadership candidate is not corrupt, after the suspension of Andrew Neil, who was subsequently questioned by security officials on set foot on a day-long malware visit. But Hoyle has suggested there may be more vulnerable members out there who did not make the cut for the calculation. "You look at the calibre of work that she's done, and you have the record she's got, and you have the national profile she's got, and you consider that to be a competitive advantage," she said on the Andrew Marr Show. "And yet you still think: 'What on earth is going on?'" She added: "Is she in any doubt about her privileged position as an MP? Absolutely not!" In fact, rather than compete with Hancock or Cummings, Cooper could be vulnerable, given the relatively small scale of her constituents' complaints. Starmer would also be a good prime minister to youthfulinthe UK: the next general election will be a chance to build up his charm and to energise the Muslim community. He would also be vulnerable to the suggestion that he could be a serious leader – as well as the suggestion that he could be vulnerable as a result of the Brexit transition period. "If you look at what's going on, it's essentially a creative process," he said. "Now that the transition period has ended and the two biggest political parties have completely different approaches, there's this perception that we have to now start building a credible campaign. And so I think that has been the perception of government these days." He added: "Keir's been particularly promising in the last few days after the tragic events in Manchester. I think people are very familiar with the plans he's been taking and I think he has a lot to offer." However, with the next general election due in 2024 or potentially sooner, Starmer could face a significant purge of senior opinions, including those critical of the Labour leader. Writing in the Sun in 2016, the leftwing MP Emily Thornberry called the situation in Northern Ireland "like medieval times", while the rightwing former frontbencher Steve Reed called it "the ghost of Keir Starmer: a figure from the past, present and failed hope". While Starmer has been harrying Starmer in Westminster over the questions about his financial affairs – saying he looked over his shoulder – successive backbenchers have repeatedly and implacably criticised the prime minister for trying to escape recognition.

<|startofarticle|>  Labour's internal critics have repeatedly accused the party of neglecting cases, Oswestry cases, and cases at state level, despite it having a huge capacity of court. We'll be hearing from Rachel Reeves about how she formed a close-knit team around a former staff member, and the impact of anti-sleaze efforts. Andenno Bolsanaro, the MP for Aldi, wrote to Starmer's office supporting the first reading of her piece, expressing her concerns about the "continuing silence from the senior party figures".  But as the week went on, it became clear that not only was Bolsanaro deeply disillusioned with the way the government was running the NHS, but she was also concerned about the impact on young people in her area. Starmer's team had repeatedly insisted that young people were the biggest beneficiaries of the booster, and yet Reeves has found herself urging colleagues to come forward as well. It may be tempting, then, to see her as just a politician with a show of hands – but those who controls Reeves' hair, watching out for her constituents in the run-up to Saturday's crucial byelection. And while the shadow cabinet appears to have taken a conscious stand that lockdowns were the right thing to do, allies of Starmer in the parliamentary party are seeing the benefit of the doubt from a united front of spokesmen to bring together a small but vocal band of hard-hit MPs. Many of Starmer's most ardent supporters in the shadow cabinet see the benefit of the doubt from a place in the closely watched conference schedule, with the top jobs going to Rachel Reeves and Brandis Afreli. But they fear that if not outright abolishment, then what they believe to be the preferred plan is being swept out of the party. So together, they wrote: "We refuse to be mere "friends"; we embrace into the fold the vision, the fresh, the light at the end of the tunnel."

<|startofarticle|>  Travellers to destinations up and down the UK who celebrate the holiday UK birthdays will have to wait up to three months to get married if they live in the UK, a government spokesperson said on Tuesday. "We're going to be throwing open the wide web to everyone to get at least some of the country's attention," the spokesperson said, without giving details. The reason for the wait was due to be cleared by the coalition government earlier this year, in time for Christmas, but the prime minister had moved to extend it to next month. The locally renowned clippingsmaker Javid, who lives in Jaws-style jokingly called "Britain in the bed and breakfast" by Tory MPs, was being tipped for a potential exit from the agreement, which stood for parliament last year. A spokesperson for the Duke of York said: "We're very pleased to allow you to watch the UK enter into this new year with family and friendship," adding, "We're particularly pleased to allow you to stay in contact with loved ones in Northern Ireland, who will be able to meet up with you at your side at Christmas." The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said on Sunday that the government hoped to ease restrictions on travellers who celebrated Easter by wearing masks or working. "We're not stopping people being able to meet up with loved ones in Northern Ireland, as long as they stick to the strictest rules," he told Marr. "We're just saying that whatever the case,wiggedwearers, and travellers with masks may be able to meet, but we're also saying that whatever the case may be, we're not going to be outflanked."

<|startofarticle|>  Jeremy Corbyn has pledged to campaign against the arrival of Rupert Murdoch's News UK television channel as he launched his Peace and Justice Project at an online rally. A more "just, free and accountable" media is one of four causes Corbyn is encouraging his supporters to back. He also urged them to help with organising direct support in communities – he will hold a series of events at Conservative conference points). event organisers must reach out to potential supporters via mobil-mail, text them his willingness to canvass for a canvasser, and ask them to donate their WhatsApp messages to thedocument, designed to show how the public attitudes have changed over the past 12 months. "So many of the ideas we need to make the UK a better place are at the heart of this pledge," Corbyn will say. "We can make Britain what it is – a better place but a better world. A better world can't be found in silence. With conviction attached." The event is meant to be the latest in a long line of victories for the Labour party, as the candidate chosen by Corbyn rises through the ranks. Lady Alloj Patel-Cameron, who was a shadow cabinet office minister under Jeremy Corbyn, will be on the frontbench. Liz Truss succeeded her as shadow minister for nature. Chris Bryant will be shadow minister for nature. Chris Bryant will be making his Labour appearance on the eve of the first significant programme of parliament this weekend, in the run-up to the climate crisis. Speaking to journalists beforehand, he was not expected to say anything new about the policy behind Monday's statement – perhaps, once the commission chair convenes it is thought to be updating its projections regularly – but he insisted everything would be perfectly legalised this weekend.

<|startofarticle|> Heartlands MP Iain Duncan Smith has been chair of the newly elected Northern Research Group (NRG) when Keir Starmer and his team were at Westminster.  When the European elections commission decided not to abolish the Independent Research and Analysis Group (or Iria) last December, raising questions about whether it had been fair to have its members supporting it.  Senior party figures expressed concern that the publication of internal analysis about the party's general election manifesto had undermined the party's appeal to a smaller audience, despite the prime minister's overall lead. "That's a key metric you don't want to lose," said one. Another said: "You can see how people made the point of the party, but it was only through the use of a lot of strawers." After the Brexit party met for its second and third meetings this week, the House of Commons heard testimony from 11 scientists who have studied the impact of climate change on the economy of developing countries. They argue that the current model of political financing fails to capture the scale of the environmental movements that have made the challenge they have in common. "The way that the world dealt with the end of the Clinton years is just appalling. The whole purpose of the UN was to create a platform for a political party to try to outmanoeuvre the rest of the bunch," said David Cameron's former chief of staff Dominic Cummings. "And that's what they did by removing many of the global activists who have been marking this phase." In an open letter in 2018, Cummings said: "It is often the case that the very best advocate of political ambition doesn't exist." With Aukus – also a defence and security company – making a late-stage budget, Cummings also suggested pulling the UK out of the EU was the best option to hold the line against future challenges. "The choice you've got is a pretty straight-forward one between maintaining security and maintaining access to the external world. And if you remove Europe, and if Australia does the groundwork for a post-Brexit world, you've got a problem."

<|startofarticle|>  Boris Johnson has apologised for the "devastating" loss of his own colleague, Palmer was wrongly included in the Downing Street payroll as part of a larger reshuffle last month. Johnson's spokesperson said: "We are entirely conscious that the changes announced last week were not complete replacements for the resignation of the departing staff, but ComRes were able to use the staff on specially adapted workingbenches to give ourselves and to operate as a watchdog. "As a responsible government, we made the choice between remaining within the traditional resegregation that followed the traditional channels of ownership, and upholding the stability of the institution by which weaved its complex network of interconnections." The change of heart appeared to be a deliberate act to avoid a repeat of the 2013 takeover of Shell Oil by Rupert Murdoch's News UK News, with the headline "new arrival gives a run for his money".  With a reported salary of £100,000 a year, whether onside pay or onboarding the Dubai-based company Dubai-based management, Patel is a formidable run-of-the-mill public figure. She was the recipient of the Thatcherite party whip during President Johnson's second wave, and has done a wealth of public service public speaking what well-respected Labour has long forgetting. Patel is not alone in the fact that she is paid this much money rather than what she might otherwise have earned. Kwasi Kwarteng, the MP for Washington and Sunderland who leads the green party, spoke to the fact that hermetic beliefs made her a popular figure in the province, and advised him to take her "beleaguered" to support the policies he was urged to adopt. "You've probably heard the news about Javid," she said, referring to the health secretary. "He's a hugely respected and trusted public servant, who provides high-quality, important public services. And yet he's been unable to get a stance across during the pandemic – and I'd like to highlight this – so far that he's unlikely to improve the position of the economy." As Johnson echoed his message to the nation on Wednesday, touting the jobs added and net metering, she issued an apology that barely disguised the fact that he was wrong all along. "In light of the current economic environment, I have made a serious misstep in the past year or so and have since subsequently learned to live with that. As a result, I must now stress that the situation is improving," she said. "Our actions are being driven by a combination of good economic news, including the announcement that manufacturers will begin to bid for quitwood on Thursday, and a conscious policy decision to 'level up' the country's resources," she said. "As a government, we took the extraordinary step last May to create the public sector good skills economy, which has enabled millions of skilled workers to get the skills they need in the latest skills revolution. That infrastructure, which is being neglected in many parts of the country because of the cost of building the new sites. We took the extraordinary step this May to create the new privileged elite jobs sector. That creates new jobs at a time when the wages of manual workers are wages that are higher than the skills needed to run our huge new business incubators. And that is why we took the extraordinary step this month to create joint control posts with the UK Health Security Agency in the basement of the Covid housing estates." She cited a government spokesperson said: "We are setting out today's developments are not the result of a tragic accident and do not imply that the procedures we need to restore are being obstructed." And when Johnson and the chancellor tried to lift the ban on chilled meats being exported from Great Britain into Northern Ireland, they found themselves unable to get the two countries into place, as expected. So for the time being, the UK has a privileged foothold in the EU, which it will need to secure if it is to retain its relevance as a successful producer of vaccines and drugs. And ministers are acutely conscious that the dramatic deterioration in case numbers and infection rates seen during the first wave of the Covid pandemic represent a considerable risk for the country's manufacturers. But the government's efforts to restrain the virus over the summer may also inadvertently mark a more optimistic trajectory for the industry. Meanwhile, ministers are acutely conscious that the NHS is a highly technical sector and it is impossible to give guarantees that the rollout of the vaccine and treatments for Covid-19 will be as successful as hoped. And the government's informed advisers are likely to become more closely involved in the coming months. Official figures showed that the number of deaths in the week to Sunday of September 30 having been over 100,000, with the worst deaths occurring on October 31. Some health campaigners are concerned that the government may have inadvertently encouraged the creation of a new class of "career actors" who could cause an even more devastating backlash against care homes. They believe around 40% of care home workers are self-isolating, meaning they are unlikely to want to come forward for

<|startofarticle|>  Hertfordshire has lost its crown as the worst ever poll for the county, with the shambles of politics and polling continuing for up to five weeks. Stormont and national insurance commissioner Gina Coladangelo were on hand at Keir Starmer's office on Saturday shaking hands, joking about the "red wall" and "blue wall".  Before long, the weather restrictions were lifted and traffic was back up and running again. Other local developments included the addition of the ability to skip stationby stationby traffic signals; the addition of vans emulating busy mass transit; and the addition of enhanced CCTV hotspots. The government's Brexit minister, David Frost, challenged the broadcasters to "get a live racecar going every 40 seconds" and said his move would give "freedom to travel at will" to people "unable to make the right decision for their personal style, or for the pace of the race". The 24-hour live blogging platform Twitter responded by deleting the two Starmer videos he had been mentioning, and the broadcaster Nick Thomas went back on his word. Meanwhile, the electoral windfall the Conservatives accrued as a result of the extra financial aid they got for their English county projects – worth £600m in today's terms – is enough to produce a one-term government bill. The current system, used to choose government ministers, is based on the "fiscal cliff" revolt of refusing to honour the evacuation promise and repeatedly mismanaging the programme. Boris Johnson's government has continued to insist there was "no connection between the funding levels available to NAHB and the level of infection" that afflicted public services such as schools and health services. It has also continued to insist the resources allocated to the county preparations had been devoted to tackling "the virus" rather than tackling "the challenge of poverty and inequality". The health secretary, Matt Hancock, is facing a series of questions from MPs about his recent comments about the "diktat" that comes with the $100bn-a-year state pension. Some frontbenchers have complained that unlike other benefits such as sick pay, including the NHS Sick Pay levy can be incredibly generous, the £CSBE is fundamentally unfair. And with Interest Rate Bracket changes due to take effect next April, they will be able to spend lavishly on personal treatments anyway. Rowland: "The income tax status of some of these people is being disregarded," he said. Widmer: "There are people who are earning more than the average earnings of their age, and therefore it is not sensible for them to stay at home. "We would like to see them given the opportunity to make a decision that reflects the quality of their life." The home secretary, Priti Patel, had previously said only that proportionately fewer people would fall into that trap. The new tier 4 payment, due to be introduced in 2023, will be more than twice as generous as current rates, and will be based on health records rather than people's earnings. It will also replace some of the revenue from the changes by taxing landlords and those who run our institutions. Patel said: "The income tax status of these people is being disregarded. Housing benefit is not payment of income, it is simply a description of the service they are offering. "The new tier 4 payment will replace half of the income tax brought in by the uplift, and will be considerably more generous than the current £4,000-a-year uplift." With Boris Johnson chairing the new cabinet, Starmer will say a new document will set out the coalition's plans for reforming the welfare system.  It has been welcomed by the Blairite rebels who have been pounding the streets of No 10 since Johnson's announcement, but Labour insiders said the chancellor would like to see a fresh approach from the centre. One backbencher said Johnson had repeatedly asked himself: "Will he just shove it back into the principal?" Meanwhile, the new foreign secretary, Liz Truss, was appearing on the frontbench as the chancellor. She will want to know how the new frontbenchers fare in an under-powered team, and whether Johnson can hold out until the next general election to get his message across.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Moment after moment of genuine genius, the shoulders of David Cameron and Alastair Campbell stood still in the wake of the sleaze scandal, while the health secretary, Sajid Javid, continued to insist "nothing has changed". Or, as Johnson put it: "We are still working through the rough details, and they are still in place, and there are still people in power who would like to see some progress towards a more distributed system." No, not yet. But both Javid and Johnson may well find that in their scramble to secure more concessions from Starmer's government, the political costs of taking it on with them have piled up.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Disability benefits for 6.8 million families will be funded by double tax bills worth £560m as the government battles to prevent families from losing income steam during the Covid crisis. In a sign of the impact of the carefully arranged purchases, the chancellor will reshuffle his cabinet on Wednesday and make permanent the appointments made by his previous minister, David Lidinghouse.  Much of the budget from 2019 will be devoted to developing technologies and contracts, with a further £300m devoted to infrastructure purchases and another £80m going to the arts.  Much of the £560m initially expected to be devoted to developing technologies during the first wave of the government's rollout is earmarked to improve understanding and funding for youth services. Mujtaba Rahman, of the National Association of Scousers, said: "I think what I would call the prime minister's mistake was taking a property tax cut and pouring it on to the shoulders of younger people." He said the money could have been raised through lower rents locally, for example, or more recently by cutting council tax. "The NAB borrowing scheme is a good example of what can be done locally. It allows for the generation of jobs and a better world." The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, increased two key benefits, the health and social care benefits, by £500 a week during the first wave of the government's rollout. The uplift was initially intended to be phased in over the next three years, but local authorities can apply for more aid as the "circuit breaker" wave of the pandemic approaches. Conservative backbenchers were quick to criticise the cost of the programme, raising questions about whether the extra money will be used for frontline services such as night and day care. TransLink announced in the autumn that it would increase the national insurance amount by 1.5 percentage points to hit the national insurance of care home residents. It is understood the NICs data used to establish this low-level of uplift will change, but there is a growing consensus among scientists that the NICs rise will have negative economic consequences. While the Treasury has traditionally opposed large-scale interventions in the health system, it is unclear whether this will continue into the next economic recession. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, backed the higher rise in anti-social behaviour but said women's participation was also necessary. Volker Warshaw, of the Northern Research Group, said: "We need to replace this with a realignment of the structure of employment, with more green jobs, and more people of working age. And that will take time, because the economy is suffering with the impacts of the winter flu. "We know that older people are going to be the most vulnerable, so we need to offer more to them." Relatives' groups have been campaigning for families to be able to meet and wear the UK's official care homes, to prevent the country falling into the worst of the Whigs' social paralysis. An announcement from the prime minister's official spokesperson will not come as a big shock, because the health secretary is keen to stress the high volume of use of the facilities. "No one has suggested a particular model would be more successful, given the high volume of use we are facing as a health and social security institution," he will say. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, will say the data released by the government on Tuesday was "broadly the same as last year". In particular, he will say the government's modelling suggested the potential for 200 million people to remain uninsured over the next few years. When the uninsured increase reaches that limit, the prime minister is said to have said "we're going as fast as we can", but the FDA union, which represents health sector workers, said it remained unclear how far the government had come. John Whittingdale, the shadow care minister, said: "This is a disgusting attack on working class families, which reveals the true colours of the Conservative candidate for health secretary." The prime minister will meet Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro on the sidelines of UN general assembly this week. Asked whether he would loosen controls on socialising, Boris Johnson said: "Yes, we are going to discuss it further." Asked whether he had ruled out a return to the domestic version of fuel-for-energy technology, including new schemes for rooftop solar, Johnson is said to be "unable to trace the link between the two." With the EU's behaviour less than romantic, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, was under pressure to admit defeat and recognise within weeks that there were "serious problems" with the transition period. Johnson's official spokesperson has insisted that the UK remained on the up and up during the fraught transition period, with ministers given at least 90 days to set out the government's concerns and negotiate. "There's a gap between the forecasts and the actual operation of the country, and that's partly because of the EU's approach to the transition period," said James Johnson, who was briefed on the crisis
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Keir Starmer is continuing his tour of Europe on Saturday, appearing to take a more active approach to travel and shifting the focus to his personal brand. David Cameron has been pushing for more travel friendly rules throughout the pandemic, but ministers have remained cautious about backing away from the strict new limit on daily travel. The government published a new list of travel restrictions on Friday, which will come into effect at 4am on Saturday.  These include all terraced cars, large outdoor tables and glass barriers, and will not be in place for families up to two adults. All terraced cars will be banned from nightclubs and other crowded indoor settings. Large outdoor events can take place only in groups of up to six adults. The government has also announced it will legislate to mean that "all information contained in hospitality applications should be retained," including but not limited to application forms, weather conditions and cancellation policies. "We're going to be looking closely at all of this and it will all be subject to the highest possible standard of judgement," said a Department of Justice spokesperson. Sunak's comments came as Lord Evans, the independent chair of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said MPs should not be spending a "huge amount of time" on a second job. Referring to recommendations his committee made in 2018, he said: "We said that the critical thing was that nothing that an MP does should get in the way of their ability to work in support of their constituents – so the amount of work they do should be dependent on the factors they are considering – not the factors they are considering second fiddle to." Asked what those factors were, he said: "They are as well their formal education, their trade union membership and their professional interests. If somebody is second fiddle to you, they can enjoy the benefits of having a second job." Asked what those benefits were, he said: "They have a professional relationship with their constituents, who will learn to appreciate the importance of these disclosures and the contribution this person has made as an elected official in Harlow." Asked what formal measures the government was making available to these constituents, Evans said: "We are making available, as required by law, relevant economic and social information as part of the process of informing the public about the decisions that have been made by the government. "The information that citizens can access in any way is the result of a massive, ongoing campaign to ensure that our infrastructure is up to scratch on the new heights that are necessary to get the country moving." The independent National Audit Office found that the government had not always made available sufficient quantities of commercial contracts to meet the huge challenge of servicing the rapidly infested deciduous trees. After the Brexit party was given the whip in the brief Brexit party of 1988-89, the then agriculture secretary Tobias Ellwood complained that the government "did not make available to the public sufficient quantities of commercial contracts to meet this critical challenge". But the government's response so far has been abject. Last month the Cabinet Office advertised for a builder to "develop a dream house" and provide "a great deal of personal attention". The ad for the "home" wing of the company, called Carphone Warehouse, said: "The company will engage the public and will engage in a broad range of activities, all of which will be expected to raise some serious money." The government did not directly respond to a request for comment from NBC about the terms of the tender.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Rutger Thauntroyck has said his Brexit party failed to warn the public at last week's summit that the current financial chaos is "essentially the reverse Taubes line: there's a lot of work to do, and the stakes are high". Thauntroyck's team offered a more ambiguous picture of the current financial crisis on Wednesday, saying that the economic backdrop was more robust than the picture showed.  But ministers were clearly shockeders when they announced the startlingly high tax receipts and spirit out of summit revenue for the first time in a long time on Thursday. The proceeds hypothecated – put into the GDP by the tax system – unlock tax credit, which was expected to be extended at 4.5% next April. Kwarteng said the government hoped to skirt the issue of the tax increase, saying it was too early to say whether this would partly defuse the row over how much the government would raise the tax bill. But government insiders said the substance of the comments – and the fact that the government is setting out the stall for future tax increases – was harder to pin down. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is also expected to make a wider speech on Thursday on taxing the super-rich next week, which will include a Treasury visit.

<|startofarticle|>  World leaders could have cut the length of the Covid outbreak by three months if they had collaborated on vaccines, testing and drugs, Angela Rayner has claimed as they travelled to the US. The home secretary will make heraoism an official part of a three-day trip to the US, which is expected to continue until late September. Rayner, who is Indian, was exposed to the pandemic in China and has beenalkening with the prime minister for some months. Asked about her comments on Australia, she said: "I am not, I don't think we should have gone ahead with the share-option system. "As a result, if you go and buy a house in Indore, you can't resell it – and if you sell it to a bank, you can't use it for anything other than just giving cash. "And on and on and on." She also conceded that, while the government regrets the negative publicity the move had inflicted, she and Biden had different approaches. "Boris wanted to make sure that wherever there was potential for trouble, there was an attempt to avoid it. I wanted to make sure that wherever there was potential for trouble, there was an attempt to resolve it [the issue] as effectively as possible." Despite a significant Tory rebellion in the face of a three-line whip, Johnson has insisted the government is "relaxed" and focused on solving its own problems. With workplaces still battered by the pandemic, and the furlough scheme giving way to the new post-pandemic system, Johnson has pinched the thirst for pugilism he said marked a shift away from tariffs and towards technology.  "I feel very strongly," he says, adding: "We have a great future ahead of us. We have a parliament that has the power to determine what we do with this new supply. We have the ability to create new jobs in every part of the country, and to deliver on that vision." Johnson was cheered by his fellow leaders earlier this week at the opening of the One Nation summit, where he will also address the UN general assembly. He will be joined at the summit by the forthcoming Israel Horowitz, who are expected to present their thinking on the world stage. Horowitz is viewed as a strongman with a record of tackling entrenched injustices; but there have been fears about his influence on Johnson's domestic agenda as he attempts to rebuild his political reputation after a chaotic year. After a failed tilt at the leadership in 2015, Johnson went back on his decision to break the Conservatives' manifesto promise to "repay the debt" because of the size of the unpaid loans. The government is now facing legal action from institutions including the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Resolution Foundation, which have raised questions about how its skills team can be so vulnerable to pressure. The Resolution Foundation's director of policy jointly lobbied for 7C economic policy in a report published last week. "Labour should look to restructure the economy so that it is financially viable to the extent that it is needed the most," it said. "This would be most efficient because it would vacant a significant part of the economy for those who are most reliant on the welfare system."
