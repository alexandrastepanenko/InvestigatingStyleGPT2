<|startofarticle|>  - Labour should prioritise the well-being of pupils - not the lobbyists or the special-interests -- and iselman suggested they should focus on the children's wellbeing Instead of taxing families to clear the NHS up to the private sector, we should be focusing our efforts on helping our children to recover from the pandemic instead of taxing them to pay for it.

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want a new curriculum either but accepted that pupils should continue to learn the rules of the classroom   Nagpaul, the Education Secretary, denied last week that there was still time to update the standards after more than a decade of Tory austerity. The Tory peer announced he was giving every adult a chance to learn the rules of the street in their constituency, even though that would be "disastrous" for schools. Mr Zahawi said this week that schools should be able to request that disruptive behaviour be banned although that would be "disastrous" for schools. The Tory peer, who led reforms to the whole learning chain from school to college, also claimed ministers should "stay home" for school children who had tested negative for the disease. He suggested the stressed out parents of troubled children should be put in a "learning environment" with them and their "kids". But he did not rule out taking action if necessary. The Labour MP also claimed the Tory party was a party of "low expectations" for the NHS and recruitment experts claimed that the Prime Minister was "a showman" getting paid by aerospace and defence contractors. NHS recruitment chief Dr Jenny Harries called on the PM to "learn the lesson from the pandemic and apply it to the NHS" and the PM to be "honoured" for stepping up to Simon Case's phone. She added: "The lack of accountability from Government on this is shocking. "The number of students leaving university without a school-age child in their lives is staggering. "These children are hooking up with people who are working-class, compassionate people, who have entered the workforce, who have good careers plans. "They are not being afforded the education they need, and deserve." Shadow education secretary Kate Green said: "The Conservatives have failed our children throughout the pandemic and want us to do something about it. "They've left thousands of pupils missing, worried for their futures, and they've left parents feeling the impact of months of pandemic lockdowns. "This Government is too slow, and they're right to be." Mr Johnson has already met with teachers, parents and pupils who say the learning road has been difficult. He has also set out a plan for regional government including giving £500 million in local government and £1 million in local authorityalties. Teachers' leaders last night called on the Government to "learn the lesson" from the pandemic and act nowfully to address the issue. They cited figures that suggest the Welsh Government could lose £6.5m a week due to the lack of good paid jobs. And they accused ministers of "missing a huge opportunity" in the pandemic. Mr Johnson spoke to a series of interest groups across the country yesterday to raise awareness of the huge amount of money that is available to help students through the education system. He has already met with school and college leaders and advisors and are working with parents and staff to ensure they have the resources to make up for lost learning. And he will today give a major speech, "LIVE will not forgotten", telling the nation today: "Labour will turn its gaze entirely away from the mountain range where our children have been lifted up but never seen by trained eyes and never able to learn the rules of the road. "We will not forget the time when Mitch McConnell created this battle between good and evil and when he united his staff and Cabinet to form a plan to defeat the Government." The Labour leader said that with so many pupils leaving university without a proper plan of action they are being "betrayed". He said: "The sad truth is that the Education Secretary has been a banker, a multimillionaire and a tinkerer. Nothing compares with the loss of life, where that precious young child cannot continue his education or receive the attention and support he deserves." Mr Johnson joined Chancellor Rishi Sunak in proposing the UC cut in next year's school budget - which will be cut by 25% - and suggested it could be paid for by scrapping the 30-year plan. The Chancellor had told the nation that £5 added to schools budgeted for this year was unaffordable. The Chancellor told the nation: "You can't spend on a school the investment needed to improve the curriculum is in the school budget to be affordable." The Government is already spending £1.6bn a year on UC but the plan which the Government plans to announce today will be compared to what it will cost the NHS in the event of a NHS collapse. YouGov also found that 82% of people who are eligible for the plan are teaching English high schools below £5,000 since January 2022. School leaders who have been forced to U-turn over funding could be on the short list of 130 or 140 applicants. Tory ministers are now odds-on leader after a general election debacle brought by the Tories. Labour was expected to emerge as the biggest party in the North with West Midlands being the other main away areas. But the party plans to take

<|startofarticle|>  NHS nurses have already missed class threatened by the pandemic  by one week  Boris Johnson has described the pandemic as "only producing misery" as he blamed Labour for its poor showing. The Prime Minister claimed that Governmentcr groups had "chosen to waste, steal and destroy" property including factories and assembly lines. At a Tory conference there was fierce competition over who should run the NHS, schools and police. Mr Johnson told them they had to follow the "heart of Labour's principles" and be pro-growth. The PM had come under fire for repeated last minute reopening of the NHS lockdown after the party had lost control of the House. Tory MPs have threatened to oust the PM if he continues to ignore the "heart of Labour's principles" and allow Tory MPs to gain preferential access to his conference. Dominic Cummings, the top Tory accused of politicising the murder of Sarah Everard to secure a peerage, has also called on Mr Johnson to resign. In the week since her murder, more than 130,000 people have died from Covid, more than the civilian death toll since the start of the pandemic. Labour has accused the Tories of failing to protect victims of crime during the pandemic. On Tuesday, Ms Everard was walking along Wiltshirehire St in London when she was shot dead by a top Tory officer last month. Ms Rayner, a campaigner who has lived locally all her life, said the Tory party should "choke" on the tragedy and agree to an affordable course of action for her and her family. "You have the opportunity to end the pandemic without causing so much suffering, so many losses," she said. "Not to bring these people into the Labour Party is completely dishonest. "It is." The next day, top workers including senior civil servant Jenny Chapman and senior Tory MPs met with party chiefs and senior aides to craft a "propositional vision" for post-Holocaust Britain. The PM's official spokesman said that the new motion did not grapple with the issue of who should run the post-election policing. "It contained no new information or changed any of the previous ones," he added.

<|startofarticle|>  Back in January, when the country was in Tier 3, only one in seven residents were white, and 85% of them voted Labour  [Sources]  And while there are no guaranteed numbers yet, according to the latest official figures, the average age of a single black Brit in the UK is just 25 years old  [Sources]  And just this week, black Brits turned against the triple lock were banned from having their births. That means Brits now only have one recourse when they are told to "scaremonger" over their next of course - by voting for a "new" candidate. In short, you do what they say you will and then warn others to stay at home. Personally I fear for the future of black Brits getting scared by the thought of black Labour and the "new" Labour that they have become "haters of the state". After all the "new" Labour they are, after all the "old" Labour they have been, the "old". Maybe it's easier said than done. Either way we will see more and more black and brown babies and children being killed in the last week of the year as a result of the deadly virus unleashed on our black population. It's not about "we" or "we" not doing anything, it's about who we are as a people and who we represent. Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  The Shadow work and pensions secretary is to stand down as an MP this week    Labour are expected to announce a new shadow laws minister for the wake of the pandemic   After months of observing "the rules don't apply to you", businesswomendeserving.be has been told that she will have to make up for any disloyalty by joining the Westminster-backed Commons Standards Commissioner's investigation. Chair Brenda Jenrick of RunNeRx said: "This is a damning report by a cross-party group of MPs into the monumental errors made by ministers in responding to the pandemic. "At every step ministers ignored warnings, responded with complacency and were too slow to act. We need a proper Commons standards commissioner to do a thorough job of policing this mess and for us to do something about it." She added: "This is a major setback for British business. "We owe it to the people of England to deliver that prosperity, regardless of the infection." Health Secretary Matt Hancock admitted that he had "no idea" how infected he was with Covid but argued for a minimum threshold of 100,000 hits a day. The rattled PM was unable to say how many people might be able to get the vaccine, and why not require vaccination first. Mr Hancock told MPs the figure is "worrying" as he said "we will have vaccine passports" by next week. The departure of the Boris Johnson that had been free on the UK's self-isolation rules and travel certificates, and British authorities are still refusing to tell Brits why they need them. "We don't want people to have to self-isolate because of Covid," Mr Johnson told MPs. "We have got to do a bit better than that. "Otherwise it all goes away." But shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said: "The Government is now advised that there is a sickness pay-out of ignoring the rules about mandatory quarantine. "The Government must stop its bluff and treat its critics in the same way it has to deal with its own regulations." The condition is that people not "engage in any social or political activity which could prejudice the administration of this Policy" unless they had been infected "reasonably possible" during the pandemic. Mr Johnson said he had acted after careful consideration and that of his staff "who have worked through the grapevine" about the necessity of the jab. The PM has been approached for comment.

<|startofarticle|>  Care minister prepares a statement on the Government's funding situation for mental health services for those victims of crime  Advocates for one of England's recently-appointed Commission on Victim Safety has put forward a statement on the funding situation for one of England's recently-commissioned Domestic Abuse and Safeguarding Services. The Commons Public Accounts Committee asked Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick to define "serious gaps" in the funding situation for the institution. The committee found that the JRSS had "no available funding" and was "unfunded" and simply did not have the money to provide the appropriate services. As a result, the JRSS had to lay off almost 60% of its staff. The independent commission found that the pay was "not in accordance with the spirit and the substance" of the agreement reached during the investigation of Sarah Everard. Chair of the existing education body, who has been briefed on the situation for more than a week, said: "This is a major setback and we are still far from a place where saying 'enough is enough'. "We need to get tough and create a safe space for this kind of behaviour - one that doesn't give a flying fuck about women and girls." Ms Harman added: "What do we mean by safe? What do we mean by being reasonable?" The PM's wife Carrie Symonds was asked repeatedly whether Mr Johnson had meant for the agreement to be temporary. She replied: "We meant nothing by it. "In order for it to be permanent we need to be able to do a lot of the things we want with our lives outside of work and childcare. "We also need to be able to afford it. We're talking millions of pounds of cuts to pensions, to health and social care, to schools, to the minimum wage." Ms Harman said that rather than trying to legislate to fix the problem, she wanted to take the money from the unions and make it available to good public service. "There is no point in trying to fix it ourselves," she said. However, she admitted that the current system was "overt and conceal" when it comes to disputes. "There are hidden agendas here and they always play a part," she said. "Hidden pay gaps, hidden pay cuts, hidden inflation, hidden austerity. "We need a new system brought in to end these hidden interests and to end the shadow economy as we know it." Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi delivers a short speech to the House of Commons, also including a prayer to remember the lives lost and lives found lives lost," he said.  "Innocent people cannot trust this government and we need a new system of learning brought about by the appointment of Dr Zahawi as M.P.C.E. Returning to the drawing-room to sign up people need to have their name and address off the Sunday night playing field. "These details are critical today will give parents the chance to publicly thank their school and college students for their efforts during the pandemic." Dr Zahawi, also a GP, was named M.P.C.E.H. Commissioner in the previous government and said that NHS appointments "were getting short breaks" as patients wanted. Overall, he said about 40% of adults are now familiar with the need for face-to-face appointments for routine illnesses like cancer chemotherapy and blood pressure tests. But he said it is important to mention that there are people who work from home and these are people throughout England. "The government doesn't want people to be forced to see their GP and not be able to have their appointments carried out, so I think that's one of the things we can do here is make sure that if you have side-effects, we will require a medical assessmentand if not immediate pay increaseswe also currently don't have any affordable affordable affordable affordable to-do lists just piled highAt this point we still don't have any money to pay our Rail Tug-in Customers or Support for Our Customers. That's not even the talking point. "The people aren't gouging us but we want them to pay for it. The only way we can get that done is if we can get the Prime Minister to agree and support a toll road and for our people to be able to get their rail tickets abroad." However, Labour is party of people who want to see rail connections across England improved so it doesn't have to travel through congested areas. "We want to make sure that we can have high levels of connectivity across the country." She added: "The people are saying we can't afford not to and we have to answer that." With each passing week there are more and more details cut from the public agenda and its relevancy means it is constantly being cut from public money. While Rail 2010/11 will now be known as the year of the rail link between London and Birmingham, the exact timing of that is still being worked out. More information on when this will happen is expected in the coming weeks. It is a big year for trains and passengers as we cruise through industrial action and Brexit, yet we have still not been told what will happen to the crippled trains that have been left behind. There are also still ongoing legal issues related to the Northern Ireland part of the link that was never designed to cross the sea between Britain and the States. But now that link has all but been shut we're seeing disruption to our supply of energy and light bulbs caused by the pandemic, which means that our energy needs have increased. When we talk about 'green' we're not talking about burning fossil fuels, we're talking about meeting it without polluting the atmosphere or dealing with some of the negative impacts of the pandemic. "That's what we need to focus on.' "We also still need a managed transition that protects the public from risks like double-digitces and unnecessary Covid and Security, which increases the risk of new coronavirus variants.

<|startofarticle|>  Calling on the Government to urgently boost funding for victims of attacks such as the pandemic as they tackled by the Owen Paterson campaign, his long-promised 'green bike' could be scrapped Boris Johnson has been urged to ditch his promise to have "no woman on the bike" in Britain when people complained about harassment and assault on the road. Tory MPs have published a draft Bill to "increase the threshold" at which harassment and assault could be criminally prosecuted - but they are yet to get a reply from the Government. Beto Jecque, the Tory MP for Thirsk and Malton in North Yorkshire, told the Mirror: "I don't think it's safe saying that women are unsafe on the bike. "I think it's quite easy to get worked-over and that's fine with us - we just need to take a look at the problem and make it something we can fix ourselves." Ms Jecque added: "I don't think it is a requirement for on-street passage. We can do quite well already have some kind of legal requirement for that." The law is unclear on what basis and how the Department for Transport might target this very narrow array of women. But Ms Jecque suggested that legal changes could be possible "quickly but we need to get ready" for them. She added: "The idea of being forgotten is absolutely ridiculous. "Let's say a new law is passed and women start to experience some of the downsides of the current one. That is a moment to be very, very cautious." Read More Read More

The Government has made clear it expects schools, in particular primaries, to be the very last thing that closes in the event of further restrictions in England. But ministers have asked the EU to help prevent another wave of departures from the EU from hitting the UK this winter. Treasury officials said no decision would be reached until the impact of the pandemic on schools was investigated. They added: "We certainly don't expect that to happen until after Christmas." EU sources warned that English-learning countries could be forced to slash their spending on educational programmes in light of the impact on schools of the pandemic. The measures EU countries are proposing would be "wider than ever" and would include a ban on U-turns on measures such as steel tariffs in future nationalizations. France is also planning to introduce a ban on French-made cars, including UK ones, and we are seeing increasing numbers of "red wall" variants as a result. Boris Johnson has been urged to make a U-turn on his plans to scrap the blanket travel ban against the over-18s and other vulnerable people after the ban is scrapped. On a visit to Arcuri, Mr Johnson told officials: "We fully recognise that there are some people who have been left behind who don't want to continue wearing the UK s welcome mask while going on holiday. "We fully recognise that that is unacceptable and we are working with our EU partners to ensure that those people are able to exercise their rights and visit their loved ones again."

<|startofarticle|>  Around 90% of Scots do not yet qualify for free or low cost taxi rides home from work indoor and outdoor  as they boost young people's chances of getting a life's help break and re-open a new life outside the UK Ãƒs heartlands A landmark poll yesterday has showed the last thing Britain needed most worried about a wave of Covid new flu infections was getting ready to lift restrictions. After months of being "bizarre", the Government is finally admitting that it could be that we don't need to hike energy prices as soon as we reopen the economy. Labour has branded the plan "bizarre" and "out of touch" with the needs of businesses. After months of boring history, the poll of 8,490 people shows voters are split in their views on the PM's temporary social care reform. Just 5% said they "strongly" supported the move, while 30% were "not at all" supportive. The poll also shows just 38% of Labour members believe the Government should continue with the cut, while 49% are opposed. While the Government generally backs workers having more than a "reasonable" amount of time to recover from a disruption to work and get on with their lives. Mr Starmer said: "I don't think we've got enough flexibility in the Government over this. We do need more investment but it's not in the financial situation." Ahead of the poll, Mr Starmer said that even if the Government can get its act together before the next election, "they've still got a mandate to act". He said: "What I am not talking about is resuming restrictions - what I am not talking about is resuming restrictions - we need to get trade deals - we need resuming our downgrading of values." But he admitted that "trade deals" did matter - and that tariffs could be added to to toughen up the defences ahead of the next election. Fears that the US President Joe Biden may travel there last Spring ahead of his scheduled visit. And he tangentially link up with Europe during his meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron last month. Brexit minister Lord Frost has warned that the UK could once again play a critical role in the EU with EU members able to "de-escalate" tensions after the chaos over the Brexit deal. Mr Starmer faces pressure from the unions and labour unions, who have backed his leadership, to reverse their switch from a pro-growth policy to a target of shareholder dividends.

We are also at risk of a similar kind of pattern of action from our Government in the future." After a difficult election result there is a sense that the case for change is "scarecrow-ish" as the Government warns Labour could lose key seats across the country. But Mr Starmer said that was not the case. "I think that in Labour columnists' minds it is," he said. There is a sense that the election result was in jeopardy "for the sake of scare tactics". That is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is a bigger chance of Labour not being elected and for Labour being politicised than it is a whole lot of people actually actually voting. "I'm not saying for a moment that people shouldn't be voting for Labour," he added. "But for a Government which has been so successful in limiting our emotions, suppressing our understanding of what is actually going on, suppressing our empathy for what is going on, is horrific." Some are suggesting that Mr Starmer could be representing the future of Labour as a whole. While he said that the Labour Party had "made no secret" about their opposition to the cuts, that it did not want to commit bridges to the Pacific or Israel. At the same time, he admitted, those who want to remain in place must continue to vote Labour. While he did not deny that Labour had always been a left-wing party, he insisted that the party had "always been" a "centre" colour. While his predecessor David Cameron had failed to land a leader, Mr Starmer claimed it was "not impossible" that he will "see" Labour down the line. His first task will be to get Labour's backbench back into power. "He has his friends, he has his friends on the left and on the left, too, but they are not the same people," he said. "He has their back. They want to listen to him and he has their back. It's scary for the Labour Party and for our country, but we do have a plan, and we are going to have to learn to accept that, and we are going to have to learn to accept that it is politically impossible."

<|startofarticle|>  Police have arrived to arrest a bodyded in UCL's Queen's Cross constituency as protests grow violent  People are reported to have been arrested on Monday for putting "political correctness past their darkest parts". A wave of coordinated arrests of members of two opposing sides of the House of Commons has sent the situation into the fourth wave. The Mirror understands that about two dozen people were arrested for protesting outside the BBC in No 10. Tonight protesters gathered on London's Westminster roof for just after 3pm. MPs are banned from using their Parliamentary offices or resources for legitimate reasons: see press secretary Emmanuel Macron today said the PM's office received a "callous" email about the gathering. The French President said he had "absolutely no knowledge" of the gathering which turned out to be important yet private. Mr Khan told Sky News: "Nobody should have gathered in this building tonight. I supported everybody else in opposing this agenda. "I don't think anybody should have gathered in this building. I don't think anybody should have gathered in this building for that reason." But there were also echoes of the Palace press briefing still waiting for confirmation from the Met Police about the PM's claims. It said: "The Met has received a callous email from Mr Johnson which stated that members of our committee did not attend our meeting which was being held on the same day as this email." Mr Khan added: "I accept that it was incorrect and I apologise unreservedly." He said: "I raised the matter internally with the Spanish President and they bowed to pressure and we have been totally vindicated." French President Emmanuel Macron has said his country would honour its "enduring commitment" to the British people. And Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said they deserved to "keep working" with the EU to crack down on the crisis. Mr Johnson told Sky News: "I raised it internally with the French President and they bowed to pressure and we have been totally vindicated. "The British people deserve to know that our laws are followed, our borders are enforced and our businesses are not able to do what we dream of doing here in the UK." He added: "In the afternoon I will set out my plan for ending rough sleeping and making it illegal in the UK." After the meeting he told reporters: "We discussed how we could help out on the street, how we could help out in the community and how we could help out in the political system." Mr Johnson said he was "very optimistic" that Tory MPs would beETF "able to agree" to any funding package. He said he had also "pushed" the Treasury department to give UNICEF a bigger match. A Stated by the Prime Minister: "This is a serious investment, money that can deliver significant change to the world's poorest people. "The Treasury should be stood next to the PM and say 'we've got lots of money in this fund that is being spent on advisory and business groups, on advisory and not-so-advice staff and not-so-investing in advisory firms.' "We shouldn't have been in this position if we'd adhered to the rules" Boris Johnson stood at the launch of the 'My Neighbour was a Pottery Barn' charity project to raise £100m a year


The PM has been urged to donate Allpurses funding to help build new schools and colleges in coming weeks. A DfE spokesperson said: "The Allpurses national board handed over £86million to benefit the deprived in England. "The £100 million pledged by the Allpurses national credit scheme will go to schools and colleges in disadvantaged areas. "The money will go towards schools that can deliver good learning for the next generation and that can help them make a better fist of it."

<|startofarticle|>  This is the second investigation into party links between Whitehall and the private sector in the last year. A probe last year found there were four or five parties at the Government's complex at the end of the school day in June and July this year. A Ministry of Education spokesman said: "This was a targeted and targeted way of assessing and mitigating risks to education. "We couldn't justify the expense or the opportunity cost in bringing these events to an immediate and determined team."ma spokesman said. "We had no knowledge of this until after the initial contact with the complainant."innervation.committee.hasanning urged the PM to bring in a specific legal requirement for ASUs to help keep pupils safe Labour has urged the Government to urgently protect pupils amid fears there could be new recruits being sent to abusive and charter schools. Over 125,000 children received their GCSEs between July and September this year - more than two years after they were invited. But the Government has yet to publish a legal requirement for schools to guarantee admitted students a safe school while they return. Ms Rayner said: "There is a lot that can't be done alone and we do need a legal framework for multinational companies to do this. "But we also need a time for everyone to be properly assessed and properly compensated for doing this work for them." She added: "What we don't have is a place for workplaces with pay systems that are based on human rights abuses and targeted recruitment of children." Ms Rayner said people should not have to self-isolate for work to pay. "We've seen this in India where people are able to self-isolate for fear of retribution and in Germany where people have been forced to self-isolate for fear of retribution," she said. "The basic idea with children is that they're important, but how do we make sure that actually they're being valued for their actions? The answer is through education. "The moment you see how badly the Government is at suppressing education, the children will switch over to science-based education and the solutions won't be there yet." They cited figures that show that the second wave of Covid-19 has killed more children in the UK so far this year than any other year. And the surge is having far-reaching health consequences, with children among the most deprived in the UK. Children under the age of 20 are seven times more likely to have complications with vaccination during the first wave, and 18 times more likely to die during the second wave. And 19 children died from Covid during the first wave, up from 12 today. Mr Johnson faces fury from Tory MPs for saying that more Brits are getting the jab than there are. He was asked by MP Tobias Ellwood what was the average daily dose taken. He replied: "I don't have daily data for that. "There are some areas in particular that are particularly vulnerable, such as London, but we also have some other parts of the country that are also making a case for more vaccination access." Mr Ellwood appeared to hit on the Conservative Party line that it is not restricting freedom of movement in the UK. He said at the weekend that it was up to individual countries what rules they imposed for passengers from those countries. While Mr Johnson did not rule out compulsory face masks from June, that still leaves more questions than answers. What is your view? Have you had a chance to comment on this issue?

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want a return to the bubble system in England - but accepted that it "has got its limits" The departure of the "bubble" exemption for estate agents was "the last resort", the Labour deputy leader has admitted. In a frank admission that the public has its own agendas and that they should "go back" to their homes, Keir Starmer insisted that it is "time to break the cycle" and replace it with one that allows people to self-isolate. In a bombshell interview with the BBC, Mr Starmer insisted that the government is "desperate" to replace bubble systems with one that allows people to self-isolate. In the wake of the Downing Street Christmas party scandal, Mr Johnson has presided over a dramatic fall in the number of people granted governorates in Scotland and a plunge in Scottish hospital admissions. Tory MPs have called on Mr Starmer to resign or be removed as leader, telling him to quit. In an astonishing admission, Labour's Shadow Employment rights secretary Andy McDonald said: "What is it that has caused this Government so much frustration? The Prime Minister does not seem to understand the basic principle of accountability. "He seems to think that by taking this country into another bubble he can get away with anything." Mr Starmer admitted he had honed his skillset and that of his business team since he took over the party in February - but insisted that he no longer had a conflict of interest. The Labour leader admitted that he had attended "many" bubble meetings which he claimed he had never attended - despite claiming earlier this year that he did. In an explosive interview with the Mirror, Mr Starmer criticised Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer for ignoring the scientific advice and for failing to address the pandemic. He claimed that the Prime Minister had been "tired of hearing nothing but rubbish" during the pandemic which banned many thousands of people from qualifying for the coronavirus vaccine. The Labour leader faces internal unhappiness that key figures including Mills, the Tory treasurer, have rejected to take up the offer of a £15 payment for vaccine passports of those eligible. While Mr Starmer has rejected the claim that he is becoming "rushed down the track" by the pandemic, he regards the situation with the EU as "clear". He said: "What does that say about the future?" More than two years on from the devastating events at Kent & Surrey Hospital, people are still awaiting their next dose. "I'm really frustrated that this Government is not listening to the people who have been affected by the crisis and not listening to what we've been saying is urgently needed help to get people into hospital." Mr Starmer has asked ministers to agree immediate arrangements for vaccine passports, saying that "now is the time to act." However, No 10 has still rejected calls by UK medical bodies to allow vaccine passports for certain categories of hospitals. In England, a Covid passport would still be required for some wards but would be more reluctant. The Government has also axed the requirement for wearing masks in schools amid fears of a new surge of Covid. Scotland is now admission only, and pupils can now be infected with the new variant if they test positive. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned there will be a "major setback" if there is no more funding for vaccine passports. When pressed on whether he would want to encourage people to see themselves as a "vaccine" deputy, he said: "Well, I will certainly be looking at the data and trying to sort of develop a framework for what we mean by that." He added: "What I'm not talking about is rejoining the coalitions, I'm not talking about having a leadership contest, what I'm not talking about is being in the room with the Leader." But Labour has said it would be "inevitable" if there was a leadership contest. The Labour Shadow Health Secretary said: "If Jeremy doesn't get his wish then what happens is we'll know for sure he wasn't right when he said that we don't want to have sex with Jeremy in Downing Street. "We don't want to have sex with Jeremy in Downing Street. "That's unacceptable." However, Mr Starmer faces fury from Tory backbenchers for proposing a "decade of Conservative cuts, more hospital closures and with nothing left to lose" in the wake of the pandemic. He said: "My fear is very much that when you look at the Labour Party's commitment to actually reopening the economy and actually reopening the economy in a way that supports the thousands of families that have been struggling for so long, it will be recognised and applauded by people all over the country." Overseas investment, expected to rake in £40bn a year, could be helped to pay for a vaccine passport programme. The Department for Transport is also expected to announce a project review in December which could include a Project Worrying feature. James Murray, head of the Institute for

<|startofarticle|>  Starmer faces calls to bring back the death penalty  Boris Johnson has been accused of ordering a massive lockdown last year to avoid a potential revolt by Tory backbenchers. The Prime Minister set out plans for a "Super Friday" Britain in which as millions of people across the country awaited his next steps. Facing calls to bring back the death penalty, the PM said he had a plan for repressing babies "if there was a moment where that was right". Mr Johnson's announcement comes after Health Secretary Sajid Javid insisted he have enough support for his country to survive "the storm". Ahead of the conference in Manchester, he said: "The British people deserve to see decent, secure lives not being lived by reckless restrictions." He added: "We also need a leader who is prepared to listen to the people who elected him". Mr Javid's attacks come after a number of Tory MPs including ex-Cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell, who backed Mr Johnson in last year's by-election, tweeted accusations at Mr Javid. After the PM denied they were part of a larger operation, Conservatives attacked Labour for its failure to address the housing crisis. Labour has demanded that Mr Javid apologise for his claim that Tory voters "don't care much about your conditions" after a leadership challenge. Tory insiders have slammed Mr Javid for his "indefensible" behaviour, with one source saying: "He's got his own petard". In a tweet, Mr Javid's spokesman said: "This PM bears a heavy responsibility. He should implement a permanent focus group on CAM to understand why people switch sides of the argument. "This is small potatoes compared to the impact Brexit has on our local NHS, businesses and workers." He added: "The PM bears a heavy responsibility. He should implement a permanent focus group on K-12 education to understand why children are not learning as well as they can and why they need a school education." Mr Javid's own Covid certificates showed he had taken them in maths and English, subjects which were not taught in the classroom. He has been approached for comment.

<|startofarticle|>  It is expected the Labour leadership will stick with Ed Miliband 's plans for the railways  as he prepares to kick off the first year of his leadership tour in Preston Morehouse made history as the Labour leader took a big tumble over the weekend. The badly-hit constituency were Labour supporters have voted Tory since the election, gov. at Westminster, in large part because of Boris Johnson's leadership. Some Labour MPs are planning a sit-in tonight in order to get answers on the state of the nation's services. Asked if he would accept the existence of a Labour government, he replied: "We will have to accept the existence of a Labour government." Mr Starmer's bigger test will be how Labour does in seats across the country. In the seat that voted for him in 2019, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham is said to be having "serious doubts" about the Government's competence. The Labour MP has been mired in a series of rows in the region since the start of the year - including allegations that he granted discounted tickets to gigs. Some have suggested he could be vulnerable in a leadership challenge for Labour if, as looks likely, he loses. However, Mr Starmer faces calls to bolster his position by bringing in more experience to his top team, as well as shaking up his shadow cabinet and setting out more detail on policy. Labour needs seats across the Midlands and the most deprived parts of the country. If it takes the lead in Blackburn and Leigh who are on the Tories' short-list, it would give Mr Starmer a serious chance of doing just that. Other options include picking up other seats in the Scottish elections or West Yorkshire, where the Tories have suffered a defeat. But Mr Starmer would love to see Labour keep the various mayoral votes it has enjoyed since 1997. Polls suggest it is looking unlikely because of the Tories' control of the South Yorkshire and the Humber. Mr Starmer is also said to be preparing legislation to take the leadership on grounds that it would challenge him over his role as a paid political insider. Labour insiders suggested that it was unclear whether Mr Starmer would back the sacked Ms Rayner over allegations of her role in the lucrative TV deal for Mr Starmer. Labour's Shadow Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds added: "Keir needs to keep his promise. Read our new strategy here. "Or he can let Ms Rayner go and let his own sleaze get the better of him." Mr Starmer refused to say whether he would back the Labour strategy if Ms Rayner stepped down. "I don't think I will," he said.

<|startofarticle|>  The Prime Minister has been warned that more delays will lead to a "rocketing" number of elderly people desperately in need of support and struggling to pay the bills. Boris Johnson faces angry calls to finally deliver on his promise to fix the social care funding crisis after ministers dashed hopes it would feature in today's Queen's Speech. The Prime Minister has been warned that more delays will lead to a "rocketing" number of elderly people desperately in need of support and struggling to pay the bills. Ministers have downplayed suggestions that a full funding package will be published today - instead suggesting millions of elderly people will be left in limbo until later this year. Social care funding is expected to be touched on in the programme of bills but there is unlikely to be any detail - even though Mr Johnson said he had a plan ready almost two years ago. Tory insiders have admitted that a "fudge" is on the cards after the PM and Rishi Sunak failed in recent weeks to reach agreement on a long-term funding mechanism. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: " Boris Johnson made a solemn promise to the British people on the steps of Downing Street that he would quickly bring forward a solution to social care. "The test of the Queen's Speech today is whether he delivers on his word. "The pandemic has shown the tragic folly of failing to invest and reform social care. "After years of cuts and inaction we need change today." The Mirror's 'Fair Care for All' campaign demands that the elderly are afforded proper care, dignity and security in old age and not abandoned. The pandemic has significantly increased the need for social care, with one in four elderly people finding it harder to carry out everyday activities. Analysis showed that 23% of people aged 60 and over found activities like using the stairs, walking among crowded indoor spaces and meeting people in groups, had worsened. Caroline Abrahams of Age UK said: "It's really sad that the pandemic has taken such a toll on the mobility, confidence and capacity of millions of older people to live independently without support." She added: "Before the pandemic we already knew that 1.6 million older people had some unmet need for care, but our new research means this awful statistic could rocket even higher this year unless the Government acts fast. "We must never forget too that behind the cold statistics are real older people who with the right care and support could be living much happier, safer and healthier lives." Mr Johnson is understood to be interested in a plan from Sir Andrew Dilnot to cap costs for individuals at £45,000 with the state covering the rest. But the Treasury and No 10 are understood to be stuck in talks over the cost with suggestions a funding package could require either dramatic cuts or tax rises up to £5bn a year. Council leaders from across the political divide in England yesterday urged ministers to make good on their promise to fix social care. The Local Government Association warned that a failure to act on long-promised social care reform would be a "bitter blow" for care staff and the millions they help. Care groups, charities and politicians have long been calling for the PM to deliver on the promise in his first speech after entering No 10 in July 2019. When asked last week the PM was unable to guarantee that proposals would be detailed today, instead saying these would be brought forward in the "next few months". In a letter to the Chancellor, the LGA warned that one-off Government grants and the social care council tax precept were "sticking plaster solutions" when long-term funding was needed. The social care system has been crumbling for more than a decade with the Covid pandemic laying bare how close it is to collapse.  Around 1.5m elderly people do not get the help they need. Many are forced to depend on under-paid and over-stretched carers working for cash-strapped firms as councils make cuts.  Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said at the weekend that a social care reform plan would be "heading for the statute books" by the end of the year. He said: "We're working to make sure that we have an effective social care plan at the moment. "So, by the end of the year you will have a specific social care plan that is heading for the statute books at the very least. "We want to make sure that we can get cross-party support for it. That is critical." A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: "Improving the adult social care system remains a priority for this government and we will bring forward proposals later this year to ensure everyone is treated with dignity and respect."

<|startofarticle|>  Police will investigate claims a gathering was disrupted after London went into lockdown ’s Horsham Street ended and Covid began tonight. A total of seven people have been arrested this evening for failing to attend a Covid press conference, the force has revealed. Boris Johnson faces claims he was asked to move crowdsourcing platforms at a Covid press conference by one attendee. A source said: "Boris doesn't like to be asked to move people." Thousands of people have been forced to self-isolate at home or isolate in isolated areas since the event - with some leaving the country. Mr Johnson appeared to criticise the social media industry for its high volume of requests. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr: "Very few people are going to be asked to live in a home, or be in a household, or all of those things are permitted by law. "I don't think it's right. I think it's very clear that if you have to self isolate or have a health problem, or are ill, or what have you, then that's not right." He added: "What I am saying is this: Many people were asked to self isolate at home or isolate in isolation, and many more are going to be forced to isolate in isolation. "That's going to be much harder for a Government that has shown no interest in seeing that kind of volume of applications." Mr Johnson told the PA news agency: "What I am saying is this: Government has shown no interest in seeing that kind of content on social media. "That's not what I hear from the Prime Minister. I hear from people who are very worried about the future of our country." Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  Home Secretary Priti Patel and Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said they were "deeply ashamed" in the downward trend in convictions  for offences including harassment and stalking for ten years ago. The latest official figures for the three months to November 19 show that 55.8% of people convicted of offences including harassment and stalking have been acquitted. The number of people acquitted of offences including harassment and stalking for 10 years is unchanged from the previous year. But the number of people convicted of offences including harassment and stalking for 10 years is just over 13%. The number of people acquitted of offences including harassment and stalking for 10 years is just over 8%. The Attorney General said that the changes were "a step in the wrong direction", adding: "It is deeply worrying that people continue to be convicted of these offences, and that they are still being harassed or stalked." She said: "The Government must stop this trend of appalling criminal behaviour and start to put an end to these despicable tactics. "I'm deeply ashamed over the injustices these murders have subjected people to. "As I understand, the Prime Minister did not want to accept the existence of a link between serial harassment and murder, and his refusal to accept the existence of a link between calls for more prosecutions and the murder of Sarah Everard.

The Prime Minister was pictured sitting in the family room with his wife Priti and their child James, who is both born in Mexico and has British birth certificates. Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green said: "This is not the first time that this has happened. In fact, this is the first time in our nation's history that this has happened. "This Prime Minister has thought carefully about the consequences of his failure to keep the safe passage drive and the flimsy legal framework that protects students from going to university in the first place. "He has lost control and must be held accountable." Mr Johnson allegedly told advisers he was "very confident" he could "fix" the "cautionary tale" and would "bring in" those who should have been banned. No10 has denied that the alleged incident took place before Christmas. But a number of senior Tories have suggested that it is highly unlikely that Mr Johnson was asked for permission to fly to his Christmas bash in Barnard Castle before Christmas. One said: "It's impossible. He wasn't able to say nor did he have the opportunity to say something correct". Mr Johnson's office did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for the Department for Education said: "The Prime Minister set out that he was determined to get a FREE MAXIMUM BAKE DELAY at the EEC today. He also made clear that he would like to thank Cabinet Office staff for their efforts over the course of his year."

<|startofarticle|>  Today Boris Johnson unveilred a 'behaviours clause' to slow the spread of the virus  Victims of crime and hundreds of businesses lost their lives today as Boris Johnson marched signatories on their behalf. The Labour leader claimed the pandemic had taken its toll on businesses. The Government has been accused of dragging its feet on taking up the suitable remediation option due to the pandemic. "They deserve to be lectured like nobody else - are not putting enough priority on putting this country first. "The Prime Minister is right to think that people are angry about the fall-out of Brexit, but British businesses want us to do the right thing in relation to the EU. "We cannot allow the good work that has been done by the EU to be undone by American greed. "We need a clear economic plan —one that is backed by the businesses and the workers, and that shows that we can keep the good jobs that are there today." Mr Johnson will face the toughest questions yet on his handling of the pandemic as a result of Mr Cummings' long-awaited showdown with the Commons science and health committees. For weeks he has been engaged in a bitter tit-for-tat with his former closest adviser over leaked text messages and key decisions he made as Covid rates spiralled. In the most serious blow to Mr Johnson's authority there were also claims that he intimidated doctors into dropping their offer to admit their patients ahead of next week's election report. Health Secretary Sajid Javid is expected to ask MPs to back his demand that all NHS contracts awarded to the companies facing financial difficulty be signed off by 2020. Mr Javid wants to sign up, rather than to order, more contracts before the end of the year. His deputy said: "It's a negotiating tactic. They seek to take us for fools and so they make it sound like they want to rip up the contracts. "If they want to rip up contracts then they need to understand that we will back them up with full details and power to change them. "If they don't, because of what the Government have been through over the last decade they cannot have any credibility with the British people." He added: "This Government will never get us out of this pandemic because of our actors is the main thing that worries me is their decision not to Sign up to the Suppliers' Climate Agreement with Australia and New Zealand." But Mr Javid will claim that "sadly" reports have emerged that the PM's support for the deal has plummeted. The Government source added: "He has been downgraded from absolutely failed by the people to absolutely rejected." Sources claimed that Mr Johnson was 'torn' by the decision which could have devastating consequences for the nation's recovery. It means he hasn't been hit in the knee with spending cuts or with the £20-a-week NI rises he promised during the pandemic, and has instead been backed up by billions in extra support for the sick and the workforce. Labour has announced that over £1billion of tax relief will be split between the NHS and social care but many Labour MPs are disappointed that the Government wasn't able to come up with a more permanent solution. Labour MP Chris Bryant said: "The only way this can be sustained is if it's permanent. "The people of England are the heroes of this Government, but the people aren't the politicians, they are the constituents, and that's exactly what this Bill will do in their constituencies. "It's time to end the foot-dragging approach to this pandemic, with actionable plans that protect the life and livelihoods of those who need it most." Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  By Dame Cressida's recommendation, businesses with turnover of more than £5m should be fully taxed as income, unions have urged  – Ministers have agreed to an "acceleration-build" until profits can be realised Haulage and food sector workers will finally be allowed to self-isolate for good, with the state already on the brink of a major breakthrough on the crisis. Boris Johnson has promised that the self-isolating rules will come "later this year" - but critics have warned that they are buried in "fraud" Covid rules which are still being enforced. The Government deliberately delayed the self-isolation rules becoming compulsory in June meaning bosses will now be able to self-isolate up to 80 workers in a week. While the law is "probably" just 50% of people who are eligible for the policy will be forced to self-isolate, the impact of the pandemic has pushed up the number of people eligible to the scheme to include young people, women and people with mental health issues. "It's becoming unusable," says Easthall Residents Association general secretary Paul Whiteman. "You can't provide services that people want, and expect to give them the resources necessary to run their own business. "The only feasible way we're ever going to get people out of this situation is if we can get them to self-isolate." The self-isolating rules for supermarket workers are likely to be settled next month Mr Johnson's plans are expected to be cleared by the end of the month despite being criticised for only allowing them to self-isolate a short time ago. Unite's assistant general secretary Howard Beckett said: "The Government has been warned that the economic situation is getting worse and that it is time to act. " "That is why Labour has called on the Government to make the right decision." The radical plan to toughen up the rules for the self-isolating sector setting up a shop trade-off between protection and satisfaction has one source saying: "Barely a week goes by without a story about how this awful idea of self-isolating has spiralled out of control. "We've seen that enough times before, care ministers have been sending perfectly good people extremely busy to chemicals-free lots." Ms Rayner wants councils to have the flexibility to accept new rules for self-isolating - but only if they prove more cost-effective. "I would call for every council in the country to mandate the right rules for self-isolating - but only if they've got a website, a product, or service that they can market themselves." She wants to see "no local authority or town hall having to intervene" to help victims of self-isolation. "There's no reason why they shouldn't be able to exist as businesses - and we should be able to do whatever we can to help them," she said. Easthall's local council have already agreed to pay nearly £1 million in corporation tax to help them self-isolate, but want to legalise it themselves. The firm's managing partner Tom Goodhead said: "Self-isolating is a complex and challenging issue and demands a thorough and balanced view. "We found that there were widespread gaps and were indeed proper steps were not being taken at all. "While we are not a lawyer or a tax lawyer or anything like that, we did find that there were cases that were getting worse and worse and worse." A joint statement said: "The Government and the charities signed up to this was a huge opportunity missed. "They looked elsewhere and failed. "For those of us who were in the position to be involved in these issues, we clearly understood. "But we were not blind to the fact that there were significant gaps and weaknesses in the delivery system". Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association said: "This is a significant step towards BMC. Too often in these days of increasing levels of connectivity and data clotting we are told 'you can only allow one person access per household per day'. "We want to make sure devices are fast and easy to manage - and that medical schools can remain one of the most intuitive parts of the programme." He added: "This is a big change from the current system where people could take abuse of facilities and access as they wish, and turn it into a demand for care. "The medical profession is split on this. We say we will not accept this as it is a wish granted to some and a failure to address the root causes of some of our problems. We strongly urge the Government to deliver on this promise and to not make this a priority." The Department for Education scrapped the part of the Hope Not Hate admissions policy due to-put minority students - but re-instated all Hope Not Hate students in May.

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi and Health Secretary therese are understood to be discussing a possible relaxation on holidays to be expected this winter Ministers are under pressure to downplay the likelihood of the UK relaxing its curbs on carbon emissions in Europe. Nadhim Zahawi said it was a "serious question" how seriously France would take the decision to cut its emissions. The three-term Socialist government of France has promised that climate change would be "completely taken" into account in future decisions on domestic emissions. But Emmanuel Macron has said that China would "rise to the challenge" and be "host" of clean energy. The French President also said that cars should be "mass produced" and that "nothing will be sacrificed for the environment". No 10 also confirmed that the PM's praise for British energy companies during the pandemic would be cut amid concerns the PM's role will be leaked. The PM will reportedly be held in "serious peril" after revelations of his drinks use rose above all else. Sources told the Mirror that the PM's wife, Eternity, 40, regularly drinks wine while chatting live on the train to and from Downing Street. They claimed that the PM appeared to have extolled the benefits of the wine during their first date at The Telegraph's East Midlands base. His wife gave a speech to the Commons at the end of the week in which she admitted to him her monthly bills are "going crazy" and that she and husband were forced to sell their homes. Her admission came as a result of repeated calls to stop the work in a wall of empty UK Treasury coffers. Ms Rayner worked as acare worker at a local fire safety centre for seven years before deciding to set up a business. Fire Safety Now she says, is now a "bunch of psychopaths", admitting she has to change. "I can't be honest with anybody about not being able to sleep at night because of this virus," she says. "I'm worried that we're going to lose this trade-off between security and comfort for families, which is why I'm so angry that there's not enough action on this." Ms Rayner was appointed Labour deputy leader in the North West in December, taking the party up 14 votes there from now. It is Labour on holiday in India, conducting pre-Christmas talks and hosting a music and holiday club. After a number of high-profile failed attempts to pull the plug on their premiership, Mr Johnson said he had decided to "pull the plug" on their relationship "now is the time" for further talks. He said: "I think it's going to be very, very difficult for us to continue with these discussions and with these discussions don't quote us, we're doing our job. "I think it's going to be very, very difficult for us to continue to work in this way." But he admitted that it was "easily" possible. Nigel Boardman, general secretary of the NASUWT union, said: "This is a huge opportunity for Labour. We have been working very hard over the last few months to get this job done and we are very excited about the opportunity to build a future under this government.

<|startofarticle|> ’Second lockdown could resume as soon as next week as Government ministers play down fears of a sudden fall-out Boris Johnson will play down fears of a "serious" collapse in passengers' confidence as he urges them to book their trips. Boris Johnson has warned that a sudden fall-out of the Brexit agreement with Northern Ireland could happen as soon as Covid. Ministers have been warned that second-guessing plans for a Northern Ireland-style border could happen as soon as EU leaders meet. The Prime Minister said: "We're going to get along so much better than we've ever been before." And he dismissed suggestions that he is preparing to "rip up" the Britain-EU relationship. After the première of May 17, the PM will leave for Ecuador on Monday meaning he could try to get on the London timetable. A deal could not be struck before the summer break which also saw Sykes open a UK-Mexico border. But EU officials claimed that Mr Johnson was ready to accept the Canberra PM's claim for patience and possibly kill us all. A No 10 spokesman said: "We are confident of securing a smooth deal for our country and our people. "We are confident of persuading the European Commission to reverse its decision and allow for the possibility for a new round of vaccine restrictions." But Mr Johnson's own Covid talks have been accused of taking place earlier this month and May 17. One European diplomat told the Mirror: "It's ridiculous. "It shows that the minds of the EU are not developed". Brussels has already delivered a lengthy offer of leverage to try to force Mr Johnson to change its position. Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney told EU diplomats in London on Monday they had to treat the offer as "a slap in the face" to Boris Johnson's commitment to extend the vaccine to June 21. EU diplomats believe that they are now in a position to round up, or "rip up" the offer of a second jab, after objections from the UK Government. EU diplomats told the British Government they had to "use their judgement" and that they should consider the letter instead. After weeks of humiliation, the EU has finally kicked up a process for stepping up proposals. A document obtained by the Mirror showed EU officials are currently working on a letter to the Government offering their views on the matter. The letter, obtained by the Mirror, reveals that the UK Government remains opposed to the spread of the virus in "high places" including in schools, hospitals, and in cinemas. It also continues to push for a vaccine passport system for France as it attempts to strike a deal with the EU. EU diplomats also believe that France is still the only country not to have received a letter from Brussels warning it of a possible risk from a jab. Brussels has delivered a letter to the Government warning it is "premature" to bring a vaccine passport scheme up for renewal last month. There is also still "unprecedented" delay in adding India to the UK's existing "extreme" list of "high risk" countries. Mr Johnson is said to be concerned about a possible Alastair Campbell-style "vaccine" jab and wants to iron out his position before another reshuffle. The PM's spokesman denied that he was against a jab being offered in schools. "We want to give all pupils the best possible experience," he said. He added: "The Government does want to provide schools with everything they need, but they also want to make sure that they have the best scientific evidence to support their decision to give a DKK strain."... and much more...

<|startofarticle|>  [ERROR] Hope no child will be left behind After years of pandemic misery for thousands of school children, Boris Johnson today promised his own Christmas bash 'wouldn't hurt anybody'. The Prime Minister was accused of "dirty tricks" and "hassles" in Parliament to secure his own news conferences and exclusive access to the public Newspapers in 2017. No10 said he would "tick each boxes" and "increase the threshold" for holding reporters up at Westminster to avoid prosecution. He insisted that it would mean "more trouble for the policeman than it will for me". Mr Johnson did give the Prime Minister exclusive access to Parliament which no other officeholder has ever had. And he dismissed the Commons tactic of having its members vote remotely from the House of Commons. In a blow to the spirits industry, the PM had told MPs there was no point having two "off the hook" MPs who are "responsible" for their constituents. Treasury insiders said there was "not much I can do" about breaking the law by voting remotely from the House of Lords. In a scathing report, the Telegraph reported how New Health was busted up between June 23 and August 5 last year after some 14,000 households had their Covid health plans derailed. The post-Christmas restrictions sparked fury and public outcry as they brought the UK's cases for Covid-19 in four days. Mr Johnson told the Commons during his visit to the Commons chamber that MPs should "hold their breath" over new restrictions until the case rates for the second wave of the vaccine are better. He promised he had a plan "in the next few weeks" to help the thousands of vulnerable people who still cannot vote with their head. But with smoking rates still low and millions of people living in houseguests and remote areas facing restrictions, it looked like the only feasible way to help them was to have our second wave of restrictions curtailed. Only 14 people died from smoking-related causes last year, which was 14.4% higher than the previous year. Sadiq Khan, who led the campaign for a second time to be allowed into Parliament, claimed it was "a little bit late" to act. The PM had told MPs he was not prepared to take on all restrictions at the same time. "I'm not prepared to take responsibility," he said. "We've run out of money, we've run out of ambition, we cannot just make an independent decision based on one supplier." Mr Johnson's no-confidence said: "I don't think it is any longer just us and BAE Systems. I think also we have to go beyond justFE." Our first lockdown in September 2016, brought about 30 people together indoors with 36 people outdoors. The technology had to be shut down once again as far as possible - as a vaccine was concerned. But the Government could not say how many people might have been exposed to the first booster dose from a UK based firm called Balcom. "30 or 50 is not enough," they complained. "At this point we don't know how many people may have been exposed." Mr Johnson was asked by LBC radio host Nick Ferrari what type of job he had. He replied: "I work in an information technology sector job. I like to listen to people before I even click the button and say, 'Hey, I'm a software developer, but I'm not necessarily a government official'. I like to listen to people before they even click the button." Mr Johnson revealed he was not very interested in public speaking when he joined the Government in 2020. Then just days before hosting the G7 summit, Mr Johnson announced his plans to "rededicate" Britain's borders to the Americas. This was revealed he had submitted a non-binding "wish list" to the PM which had been cancelled as the country drew down. But what if they all went ahead as planned?

<|startofarticle|>  Around 50 Labour MPs, including Hannah Brady, have written to the PM demanding that the Home Secretary does more for sick people who have had their benefits extended, and why is his taxpayer funded 'poverty wall' not enough? They have also asked the Government to apologise for its heavy handling of the Nuffield scandal and for failing to prioritise the well being of families already struggling. For weeks the Government has been embroiled in furious battles with its own MPs over the real terms salary figures for Director of Public Prosecutions. It is now even worse that the PM refused to even explain what type of investigation his predecessor might have drawn up for him if he had recused himself from the case. The only feasible explanation left him was: "This is so confusing." So he went into Parliament and failed to duck his way through a humiliating Tory failure to protect his democracy. Instead of seeing the damage that his failure had done him, people were actually furious that they had been let down again. Boris Johnson has been blamed for failing to intervene urgently in the pandemic stalking herd which has grown exponentially in the last year. That is not true. As the Mirror reported yesterday, the Prime Minister had to delay the scheduled return to Whitehall for eight days after the four-point charter was confirmed by the House of Commons. As the Mirror reported yesterday, the charter did not contain a specific referral for investigation or a specific way of getting a first minister's resignation announced. Instead, the document was tabled as a addition to bills – despite the House of Lords slightly more Republican. The gaping hole in the Government's competence had emerged as a result of the pandemic, MPs blasted. "With so much going for the Tories in the Commons, it's very important that they don't do anything that will put this country through another terrible year," said former MP and Brexiteer Mark Harper. "These are big decisions that will have a devastating impact on the course our country takes, and which we expect the PM to take account of." He added: "The PM bears a heavy responsibility that he takes with him and we shouldn't forget that." Pandemic Kegels began rolling out the 'ping' vaccine today in the UK and Poland. The pinging scheme offers a £10 lump sum payment for those who can demonstrate that they will be used in a positive case – and will be based on the type and capacity of the person who gives up their job. Downing Street has insisted that the offer is "based on merit" and that it is "working to minimise the impact" on workers' pay. But Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng claimed yesterday that it is "not based on any sort of rigorous standard" in awarding contracts. There are likely to be several contracts going through the sunbathing sector this weekend. Mr Kwarteng, discussing plans for multi-year pay rises for MPs, said: "That's a new issue for us, it's not based on any sort of rigorous standard. "We want to have that system in place." Earlier, the head of the armed forces warned that the PM's salary freeze could plunge thousands into poverty. General Sir Nick Carter, chief of the defence staff, said: "It is quite worrying that people are being told you can't vote for an inflation-targeting budget because of the budget." Earlier, the Queen had urged him to avoid a "Christmas surprise". In a message to him, the PM included the slogan "Lots of people are out on vote due to the Budget". Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  British holidaymakers are likely to be exempt from a blanket entry ban to Europe thanks to the UK's successful vaccine roll-out. Holidaymakers with government-backed vaccine travel certificates, which the Government plans to announce next month, are already booking holidays in European countries including Spain and Greece. Ministers are likely to announce a decision on the plans last November, just days after earning their Tory heartlands a positive response to the pandemic. Cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg told MPs the Government would "learnively" update the entry criteria for Brits coming to the UK to ensure they are fully vaccinated. The Foreign Secretary told MPs that Europe's vaccine roll-out suggested the UK could not only guarantee vaccinations for its citizens, but would also be able to offer them "special" support. Vaccines CEO Patrick Dujarric said the UK had "days, not hours" to get a grip on the situation and could take other measures to help drive down arrivals. But he added: "It really does risk us getting a significant lift in the next weeks and months". Government insiders suggested Mr Rees-Mogg could block any restrictions by saying the Government had to make a "hard decision" on the Five Eyes agreement, which banned both UK and EU countries from doing business in the EU. That move would mean easier measures such as sanctuary states and visa blockades in the EU. But Whitehall insiders have suggested that Government efforts to reach a deal on a vaccine executive would require a "very specific" change to the agreement. They claimed if Government scientists could only reach a decision by the end of the month. While the Government can no doubt make some concessions on technicality, it is clear that will be difficult if the executive is to blame. Go North West chairman Tom Goodhead told The Mirror: "We are still working on a solution to enable members to survive on our low-tax diet. "We still believe the executive can do this. We have still not come across a solution that allows restrictions to be placed on our NHS or other sensitive sectors. "We need a change and that is what we are working on." Under the current regime, a Covid relaxant grip was permitted on public transport after just one ruling in May. But the policy was gradually relaxed once again this week. Earlier this week, London was given a £739.95 fine for failing to fill out a travel declaration form during London Fashion Week, down from more than 1,000 so far this year. There are also likely to be more fine print tweaks to the regulations next week. The PM's not saying much about restrictions yet, but he could be in for a real tough time. Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi also faced pressure to bring in 'safe' exit dates from Europe as he attempted to strike a trade deal with America Boris Johnson has said he will leave Brexit talks with the United States "as soon as it gets warm" after a rocky first year in power. Labour leader Keir Starmer claimed the Prime Minister was "woefully inadequate" at the task facing him. The Government has been criticised for capping hours at which people could learn to speak their minds - but not publish their own thoughts - during the first year of a new US administration. It came as Donald Trump was plunged into crisis after he ordered his "inflation, price and noise" unions to cut their strike activity. The Dow Jones industrial average lost nearly 1,000 points after a week of crashes. Markets have plunged by more than a third in the last year under a group led by anti-poverty charity Joseph Rowntree Foundation. Rowntree led calls for Labour to bring in inflation, the average salary rise or pay cut. On top of the £2.5bn owed to the Treasury by the DUP, which is under pressure to fund the programme, there are also £6.5bn owed to the EU and US tax hikes, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.

The passports are expected to be ready for rollout this summer. NHS Providers has approved 9,294 certificates of vaccination for Muslim girls as they prepare to depart the country. The passports are expected to be ready for rollout in summer 2018. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: "The UK is strong in Afghanistan and we are strong in Iraq, and we are also doing a lot of the work that we should be doing in Afghanistan. "We know that without the right epidemiology and for a virus that is rapidly getting stronger, it is not possible to predict food shortages and there are very serious questions we still don't have a vaccine plan for Afghanistan. "We absolutely have to evacuate Afghanistan." The Taliban says it is ready to recognise UK passports as it was used in World War II to hail a pandemic. But around October 19, 1945, four months before the Allies attacked, the British secretary demanded that he sign up for a document proving his passports were ready for flight. The following day, US vice-president Henry Valdes travelled on a Secret Service train into Little Saigon, where he was arrested. He complained to the Secret Service about the "feeble and acting" handling of the quarantine schedule, and was later interviewed by a Congressional investigation. The US President was given a ultimatum: Either accept the rules and keep your passports, or get them changed and apply for a US travel passport. The former passport would have been invalid in 2018. But the Foreign Office was eventually persuaded to provide him with a future passport, which he could travel on to new offices and tourist attractions. When he was unable to use the passport office in Government, he was arrested on April 18, 2020, and charged with four misdemeanours: unauthorized entry into a diplomatic mission, interference with a person's official business, and entering the United States from a designated airport. The following day, US MP Tom Tugendhat, a pro-Israel Member of Parliament from Ervin, shouted: "Allahu Akbar!" As the UK and the US backed down, however, Iran responded with a brutal crackdown that killed 180 people and left more than 500,000 people refugees. President Hassan Rouhani cancelled all international travel for 72 people in the week of January 21, with most restrictions ending on January 21. The country's tourism minister was forced to quit after being accused of welcoming in "criminal aliens". Reports suggest that officials want to keep the law in place preventing people from mixing together in public. The travel and hospitality industry is heavily reliant on foreign workers sending in their own bits and dine alongside British tourists, raising concerns over the impact it will have on attendance. Labour 's Lisa Nandy said: "The Home Office is so determined to break the law that they can't break the rules at all. "If they think their measures don't violate the law, they're not acting in accordance with the rules." French President Emmanuel Macron has said the UK will not accept Iran's bombastic claims over the imprisonment of Sir Simon. In a bombshell interview with French state television, Mr Nandy revealed that the UK fears for their own safety at the hands of the PM's bombastic actions as he vowed to "destroy" the Government's bombastic response to the North Korean regime. The ex-minister warned the UK "we can't afford to re-establish our values, our values are based on man-eat-man. "If the regime breaks out of its rocket range and we don't have our man-eat-man, then my job is complete. "I can't wait for our car to hit the sea floor and crash into the wall, killing all those people who helped us. "But the time is right to intervene." The PM's bullish approach represents a shift from the relative caution of recent months when he delayed the final step out of lockdown by four weeks. Brexiteers fear that the Government may just be too willing to sacrifice social security, potentially for the investment boost. Key Tory MPs including Middlelupery Johnstone, Stephen Crabb, Kelvin Chair, Rachel Reeves and Rayna Downey supported the Government's cautious approach to lockdown. They said: "We've made some small concessions to the press and will only be making those concessions if we can make it through the autumn." Mr Johnson risked an "impossible" decision after the collapse of the Downing Street lockdown plans, with one plan ignored by the press and thousands of people prevented from seeing their loved ones. Cabinet minister Ben Wallace said yesterday: "It is still unclear whether the Government will able to get through to the people they so desperately want. "We are still working on this option." Mr Johnson said he had a "lot of work to

<|startofarticle|>  [ Labour MP Alastair Campbell has written to the three senior ministers urging them to force London's inflatable windows and gates ] [ Labour MP Alastair Campbell has written to the three senior ministers to ask whether they should force the hard core of Brits who have bought the tickets from the EuroKhan 'virtual' qualifiers to self-isolate from the city's strict Covid curbs . "They should," he added. "They should be able to buy a Covid licence." The virtual qualifiers for the 2016 Olympics will take place on August 5 and 6, 2016. The PM has promised that "nothing like the London Olympics" has ever happened in Britain's history. Boris Johnson faces major criticism after he ordered his local hospital to turn down thousands of foreign drivers wanting to try out for the programme. Local NHS services in Greater Manchester were said to be down by over a million over the summer because of the Covid crisis. And quizmaster Zac Goldsmith, who helped Mr Johnson land the plan, is reportedly preparing to leave No 10 for another job at US tech giant Silver Stream. Mr Johnson is expected to announce the departure of this week's top civil servant, who the PM described as "weak", as the next workforce chief when he flies to New York on Monday. But Mr Campbell tweeted today that "Boris Johnson faced anILL bomb threats while he was Mayor!" Labour has tweeted that the PM had been urged by MPs to meet with civil servant Sheni Foo, who has been repeatedly targeted for violent extremism by the Government. Mr Johnson was reported to have been informed of the meeting on Tuesday by a civil servant at a No 10 Christmas party. Labour has demanded that demands for an investigation into the First Minister's actions outside of Downing Street be honoured. It also want him to apologise for pursuing to CCHQ the issue of leaving No 10 Downing Street bare. For weeks the PM has been engaged in a bitter tit-for-tat with civil servant Sheni Foo, who has been accused of abusing the position to get the Government together on a campaign. It has been reported that Mr Johnson intervened while the BBC was under threat of a cyber attack from Indian trolls. And on Tuesday, Labour slammed the Government's response to the PPE protests, claiming it has amounted to "blatantly disrespecting a civic duty that no other civic duty bears".

<|startofarticle|>  Civil servants fear there are even fears that the vaccines row could split the EU into two or more countries - potentially breaking the fragile mous-tra-marie between EU and UK laws. EU officials warned this week that they were prepared to consider new measures to try to stop the spread of the virus in European schools. But British officials have said they are not prepared to illegally remove children from Europe because of their quarantine status. That could include measures such as wearing face coverings and meeting people outside schools. However, EU officials have suggested children from ethnic minorities should be exempt from the measures because they have been exposed to the virus here. So far Western countries have attempted to relax restrictions on UK tourists by restricting entry to people of two or more "host" countries. But an EU source suggested that an agreement could be reached "quickly", potentially before Christmas, and urged caution. They said: "The uncertainty is yet more," they added: "This is a 'game-changing moment' for travel, with new ways of enjoying the UK and around the world. "We do need vaccine passports, we do need vaccine policies, we do need teachers' certification exams, and we do need a way for European children to prove their Covid status." Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  Schools which taught by ESL teachers had significantly less weekly disruption than pupil-to-teacher schools held similar amounts of time ESL teachers in the first year of school had significantly less weekly disruption than pupil-to-teacher schools ESL teaching staff in the year 2020s did not significantly less efficiently complete the week of intensive teaching during the first ESL wave  ESL-inferred learning throughout the year Education Secretary has defended the interim delivery of the £20-a-week uplift for those pupils who academically cannot get their GCSEs. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson insisted the move would not be used as a "benchmark" and would be rescinded If approved, the uplift would be available to up to 80% of those transferring from the poorest families to the most affluent homes by the end of the school summer term. But around 90% of the 834,400 pupils who have got their Essay visas yet are not yet admitted to university are not yet receiving the money they are looking for. Instead they are being billed as "partly funded" by the Government Education Department grants programme - although the actual amount of money awarded is still being set out. Mr Williamson was accused of "unethical and disgraceful" practices when he announced the temporary uplift for the academically disadvantaged over the weekend. He refused to deny that the move would be used to wrongfully deny students that the full impact of the pandemic would be felt in their classrooms. Instead he insisted that it would be "free for everybody" to receive the uplift - even though it would come in at a cost of £4.8billion. Now Mr Williamson has delivered the Tory uplift to the highest earners while slashing the funding for the Body that helps poor parents buy their first home. The Budget also includes a £59-billion cut for the deficit after a decade of austerity which has left many millions of families struggling to cover the bills. After months of protests from Left and National MPs, the House of Lords has approved a possible rethink on the cut. No 10 said it was wrong to threaten MPs with a vote to rescind the cut. But a cross-party group of MPs said that this was "morally wrong" and that it should be made illegal. They wrote: "This is a serious error of judgement and we are working with the British Government to ensure we never will break the law in our practice." Previously the Government had asked MPs to introduce "hierarchy and conditioning" to determine whether the amendment was invalid, but only if it was needed to end a debate. The amendment would make the requirement illegal even if no suitable mechanism had been devised. Morality experts have called for the end of the requirement to be countenanced, at the very least because removing the requirement from the vaccine roll-out to June 21 would mean that more people were forced to quarantine.

<|startofarticle|> > The Mirror can reveal another top Tory broke Covid party rules at Christmas as then Education Secretary Gavin Willamson hosted a 'reckless' bash during the ban on socialising As millions of children faced the misery of Christmas under strict Covid rules, ex-Education Secretary Gavin Williamson threw a party. London was in Tier 2 – which banned any social mixing between households – on December 10 last year when up to two dozen of Mr Williamson's staff gathered in the Department for Education cafe for "drinks and canapes". The former Cabinet minister delivered a short speech at the evening event before officials and ministers knocked back glasses of wine. One source said: "There were lots of people gathered in the cafe area, mingling and drinking wine. It was just so reckless". Another added: "He hosted a drinks do when people were considering whether they could spend Christmas with their families." Tonight the DfE did not deny Covid rules had been broken and admitted "it would have been better" not to have held the event while the rest of the country was banned from doing so. Official DfE figures show that state school attendance on 10 December was just 85%, meaning that 1.2 million children in England were out of school. Just a week before, on December 3, Mr Williamson urged people to take the "responsible approach" of following social distancing and self-isolation rules to avoid a new surge in cases and tougher restrictions being imposed. The revelation comes after the Mirror reported Prime Minister Boris Johnson and staff attended parties at No10 in the run-up to last Christmas. At one on December 18, members of his top team enjoyed drinks, nibbles and party games – including a Secret Santa – until past midnight. Fresh allegations today revealed officials organised the party a week in advance via a Whatsapp group, followed up by an email. One source said: "Of course it was premeditated... Everyone came with Secret Santa presents." Labour leader Keir Starmer said the PM should "have the guts" to be honest about what happened. Mr Johnson said: "I am satisfied myself that the guidelines were followed at all times." Revelations of Mr Williamson's drinks do follow ex-No10 aide Dominic Cummings ' lockdown-busting trip to Barnard Castle and former Health Secretary Matt Hancock's social distance-breaching clinch with an aide in his office. As Mr Williamson gathered with staff, Mr Hancock was telling the No10 press briefing how the Government was "particularly concerned" about the rise in Covid cases among secondary pupils. He announced an immediate plan for testing all secondary school-aged children in the seven worst affected London boroughs. Mr Hancock said: "With Christmas coming, there's something we all can do which is to respect the rules." Shadow Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said today: "While Covid rates spiralled, schools were in crisis and children prevented from seeing friends and family. "it is clear the DfE didn't have a plan – but did have a party. "This Government has failed our children throughout the pandemic and does not have their best interests at heart. Boris Johnson and his ministers believe they are above the rules, it's truly one rule for them and one rule for the rest of us." Mr Williamson, who was sacked by Boris Johnson in his last reshuffle, was at the time of the bash struggling to handle the impact of the second Covid wave on schools. Hundreds of thousands of children were forced to self-isolate at home, missing yet more school, when somebody in their "bubble" tested positive for the coronavirus. The party took place just days before the Education Secretary threatened a South London council with legal action if they closed schools. The only feasible legal way either the No10 or DfE gatherings could have taken place was if they were "reasonably necessary for work" under the regulations. Whitehall staff have been classified as key workers throughout the pandemic. A DfE spokesman said: "The gathering was used to thank those staff for their efforts during the pandemic. While this was work-related, looking back we accept it would have been better not to have gathered in this way at that particular time." Mr Williamson was today approached for comment.

<|startofarticle|>  'These people are terrifyingly corrupt'  Boris Johnson faces calls to cut spending on programmes which benefit the most vulnerable  The Prime Minister has called on Boris Johnson to commit to the "sustainable development" of Britain's future in the wake of its pandemic  MPs told him to clean up his act. When asked on NewstalkCHAT how he would do - and how preferably he would fix the mess he helped to create - the PM silenceed."@newstalkhoward The Prime Minister has become a showman by taking this issue to court," said a headline reading. "His total lack of knowledge and complete disregard for the rules and standards in his own House of Lords gives confidence to the wild accusations." It added: "He cannot be trusted." Mr Johnson has had a net gain of more than £1m in the last decade sharing the care of double-jabbed Asian holidaymakers and long-haul drivers, as well as business people and the disabled. The PM last week satiesced to secure a £15m uplift for schools, which the Government had backed industry leaders have warned. He had the permission of the Commons committees which scrutinised the advert from the advertising department. But the Business Secretary and the chairman of the Tory conference had already missedpport their meeting with the CEO of Sainsbury's, which was also looking at the Covid uplift. Sources told the Mirror that the Business Secretary was seeking to avoid a re-election 'with a bang'. Labour has accused the Tories of being "caught red-handed" and are set to lose their Candy Robinson bounce at the hands of the Tories in 2019. Keir Starmer is set to lose by a wide margin the Greater London Authority bounce he began in 2019, badly. One Starmer ally told the Mirror: "There are going to be significant blows to Labour in the upcoming elections. "The elections will be fought on the front lines, with the Tories defending and the Labour Party talking about the things they know are right. "That's what Keir is focused on, that's what he will spend the summer talking about and that's what he will lead the party into the next general election." Another added: "He knows this isn't easy but he is absolutely committed to seeing it through and getting Labour back to a better place. He's not going anywhere". One Labour insider told the Mirror: "Keir is right to criticise the PM for going in this alternative direction. But he needs to understand that Labour doesn't want to get Labour back to a better place. "We want to get Labour back to where we want to be." Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  Next to No 10: the PM 'hasn't got a plan' Boris Johnson is said to be willing to take a "knife on anybody's back" as he seeks to blunt the damage produced by the pandemic Holiday plans for London first appearing delayed this year. Secretarial staff will be offered free inoculations from this week, while jabs will be offered for those claiming they have held back from catching the Delta variant. Government insiders claim the PM is preparing to "cut the Gordian knot" and offer inoculations to Brits who haven't yet had their jabs. But Mr Johnson has put forward two alternative measures for parents who could be hit hardest by the soaring rates of infection. He said: "We will do everything in our power to help people who have been provided the ability to travel abroad, and we will do everything we can to help people who have been vaccinated or who are planning to vaccinate." The winter months will also be limited to primary school children and adults in England, as the Government moves to keep pupils in place until June 21. Scientists have claimed that the predicted split during the first year of the new National Health Strategy aims to be "virtually non-existent" for certain social regions of the UK. Deputy PM Dominic Raab said last night: "It's almost too late to avoid the virus. "There are going to be critical periods during the pandemic where case rates are going to be really, really high. "That's why I think it's quite scary." He suggested that if we ended up looking like we're still looking like it a "journey hell" for many people, then it was too late. Mr Raab added: "The fact is that the Government knows this doesn't look very good for young people, that it doesn't look very good for young people, and that it doesn't look very good for young people at all." Labour has said it would be a "huge mistake" to scrap the changes after they were made because they could make the situation worse if young people continue to be under threat. Mr Raab added: "The fact is that the Government knows this doesn't look very good for young people, that it doesn't look very good for young people, and that it doesn't look very good at all." The changes to the Teaching for Leaders programme will be brought in under a split Government. The TUC has found that almost a year after the drop-out figures were recorded, 33% of those leaving education failed to meet their academic and pastoral targets for two years after they returned. The failure of many schools to meet their targets has prompted fears that some schools are shutting or are going into legislating cases instead. While this is unlikely to change today, the Government is said to be confident that the academic and pastoral teams will step in and help us to get it right." It comes as figures yesterday showed the UK's daily GCSE exams for all youngsters fell to lowest on earth in November There are still 22 exams being offered in schools across the country, but in which children were last month told they could only get two years of Covid exams. There are also two that were unavailable to some children last July and August, but are now needed. There were a further 14,000 children off school in September. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is refusing to bring in another 8,000 Covid exams this summer, and is said to be unwilling to the British Education Leaders' Group's call for more support for the demand for compulsory Covid exams. Writing in the Telegraph, Mr Williamson said: "We've had enough of the excuses the Government has. "From delivering on the school success accrual accords, to refusing to invest in the toughest Schools Act 2030 and inaction on the front line in tackling the crisis." He added: "The hypocrisy from this Government knows no bounds. "It goes without saying that students from deprived backgrounds should have access to quality education and support, and should have access to quality careers advice." From the Tories down to her side, there was even anger in the Tory ranks with some Tory MPs suggesting that Labour should stick with the disastrous arrangements provided by the Health Secretary. Tory MPs have threatened to vote against a motion to keep the payment - which they believe is essential to keep pupils in the classroom - unless there is more work to do to address the problem. A further threat comes in the wake of the Labour Leader's pledge to "repeal and replace" the act with a "fundamental change" such as extending school hours. While no two MPshed formulas for action were carried out, Labour has put forward a desire to see the Commons act now so that MPs can return to Westminster for a vote. In the event, the Government did return to Westminster for a vote on the changes on November 15. But it remains unclear whether that will happen, with the proposed changes only appearing on the back of a motion. Earlier this week, the Governmentetz Opposition office received a tip-off that its by-election was not on

<|startofarticle|>  What is Brexit for? Let's focus on jobs, jobs and the economy  Boris Johnson has been saying for weeks  [Labour, Tories & unions] - the Prime Minister will today try to move on from the damaging saga that began with last year's Brexit. Boris Johnson tried to rip up Britain's divorce from France as he walked away from a summit with French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House. The Prime Minister had insisted that France was not part of the "Last Hours" tour and could not be held responsible for the "foul disruption" at nightclubs and gigs last night. As he left the summit Downing Street was reported to be gathering dust under unimpressed staff. No 10 was said to be unwilling to help Mr Johnson get his message out. One source said: "They're having to change their approach. They're not having much of a plan." The PM has been warned that more staff shortages will lead to confusion and anger among the Tory left. Boris Johnson tried to rip up Britain's divorce from France as he walked away from a summit with French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House on Tuesday. Mr Johnson said he was "very optimistic" that Brexit negotiations could be concluded today - despite fierce criticism from his own Tory backbenchers. The PM put his stamp of authority on the French President by promising to be an "intolerable crime" but Britain was "not willing to stand in their way". No 10 was said to be willing to accept that leaving the EU would be "irresponsible" and "irresponsible" for our peace and security. It would therefore require a change of the Brexit deal. Brexit minister Lord Frost issued a veiled threat that if France and Germany pulled out then the EU would "have to withdraw". Mr Johnson's remarks come after French President Emmanuel Macron threatened a "pinochet order" response against the UK if he left office. Brussels has delivered a foreign policy mauling since France and Germany kicked off their fourth wave of migrant surges last month, with Western sanctions designed to exert an influence on the bloc. But Mr Johnson's departure has sparked concern in the corridors of Government as to whether the UK will remain a "red wall" or a "green wall" in the South China Sea. After days of dragging his feet, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab threw a press conference in the Queen's Speech mired in controversy. However, the Labour leader painted a picture of a Government that is "lost in the waters" as they try to figure out how they can best help the world's poorest people. He told the BBC: "The world is turning against us, people are angry about the Afghanistan policy and the Iraq policy, but we have no business being silent. "We have got to be clear that the line is very clearly that we cannot and should not be silent. "We are not alone in this. There are all nations around the world trying to build safer, more responsible green spaces. "But we are not alone in this. "We must do everything we can to help those who wish to leave." Mr Raab also claimed that the "end result" of Brexit would be a spike in cases highlighting the difficulty of getting around our shores. Asked if he meant by saying "we can't be held back" like Germany is, he said:  "We should be very, very strong. We can't be held back." The PM finally admitted that German Chancellor Angela Merkel was not exactly known for her "open" attitude towards freedoms. He told the US President: "Tom [Nadal] Keynes was a brilliant economist. But he was also a free man. Can we make free trade a fact, then suddenly be accused of being soft on crime? "There are many, many things that can go wrong together," he added. It is the second time in as many weeks that the UK has stepped up tensions with Germany over our railway links. The PM has also suggested that France may not want to fund its mandatory vaccination programme while Britain is in a vegetative state. On Thursday, Mr Johnson told MPs the Government would have to act sooner if vaccines fail to curb transmission in the UK. He said: "I think it is not possible for the Government to delay the benefits from this vaccine rollout through to the autumn." The Health Secretary refused to rule out another lockdown next winter when he left for a holiday in Spain. But he was unable to say whether that would be easier than existing lockdowns in Europe.

<|startofarticle|>  Home Secretary Priti Patel and Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said they were "deeply ashamed" in the downward trend in convictions  for offences such as harassment and stalking for prisoners More than a decade on from the sentencing of Kiersten Dyson, a Tory MP for defending the lives of women and girls, the public gallery was tonight closing in on a deal to welcome Sir David into their institution. The public gallery will today hold a minute's silence at 12pm followed by a bell toll, and a siren went off. After the figure came in, Sir David was accused of failing to preside over a matter-free way around the rules on memorials. His response? "Not knowing what was required to pass the buck". That was more than three years ago today we learn, when we should be thanking those who worked with us to save women's lives. "But what did we learn during that pandemic that led to this?" We ask that today. Sir David, with honour, is believed to have told the Commons from his grace-and-favour House of Commons our support for his legislative victory over the Gaucher tax cut. Legislation making four million prisoners Justice Secretary Sir Peter Fahy announced that sentenced to life in prison for the murder of Sarah Everard would be remembered as a "whole life" deterrent. The sentencing comes just days after the Queen sentenced 48-year-old Tory MP Gary Mills to life in prison for the murder of Sarah Everard. Mr Mills was found guilty of murdering Sarah Everard, who he met at Drake University, and spared no expense to save her life. She was abducted on December 18 last year and taken to the hotel where she spent the next few days learning more about her new lover. After her capture he showed her a Secret Santa that involved him kissing her cheek and entering her name, address and photo details. When she refused to comply with his commands, he kicked and insulted her, ran him over and kicked his wife's dog, Shandia, who was also kicked in the leg. He then kicks and insulted Sarah all over again as he feigned interest in seeing his bride killed. When asked how he felt when he was happy, he would only say: "Well I don't really feel very proud." The Prime Minister was also unable to say whether he was sadistic or not. He said: "If I was a cruel monster and I wasn't sadistic then I think I would be very, very sad." However, his wife said that he had no children and that he had "nothing left to offer" in the house. Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  The NHS guidance says staff must not work more than 32 hours a week, plus half the shift pay for someone on short-stay visas  The union which represents NHS staff has hit back at claims that the NHS staff shortage is "unacceptable"  Mutiny on Wednesday as MPsjoin us as we tell the real story of how our NHS was once a great place to be learning what it takes to get a school into class - but now it's a laughing stock When Keir Starmer was a little boy, he didn't know much about football. So when he saw that BBC quiz show, he said it had to be better. "You can't tell the difference between good looking football matches and being let go," he said. "That's not what we want... If you have to go home, you can't be honest with us about that." And he exploded at the suggestion that Covid rules regarding stay were followed. "Why should Covid people follow their rules on returning to their country of residence when they can apply for tourist selectings and free meals there? " – Keir Starmer.

<|startofarticle|>  Confirmed dead are as a day old, seven days old and 258 sick children in Republic of Congo, with a further 37 reported dead yesterday, six of them on the front line. A further seven countries - Brazil, Turkey, Pakistan and off-licence - are yet to be named but a few are certain to be on the rise. Confirmed dead include people infected with the Indian variant, pregnant women and girls and pregnant women and mothers-in-law. Organised cremations start today and are likely to continue for some time. No 10 has denied that the figures are wrong and that the crisis is connected to Brexit. The PM has insisted the problem is down to "more people coming in from the Continent". But Mr Johnson told the Speaker that Canada, which has high obesity rates, was "not on the list" but that "more people" had come in from Europe to visit family. And he prompted disbelief among Conservatives. "Why are they killing people off because they found a way around them?" he asked. Mr Johnson added: "We will fix it. We will bring it into the 21st century." It is the second Government in less than 24 hours to announce that Britain has decided to leave the EU. The first leaving gracener was Theresa May's Brexit deal which she said would be "a mauling seat" for trade. The Government had been pressing ahead with a temporary agreement with EU countries after the June 23 referendum alleging that it was "on the cards" for years. But Mr Johnson said today: "We cannot continue to have the arguments that are being made today, the phenomenal achievements which are pulling us down this road, are not being made in a practical way. "These are serious times that require serious action. "We are not isolating cities because they are no longer economically viable, they are also making them very difficult for us as a multinational company." Under the deal, different EU countries would work together to create "trade deals" that threatened to overwhelm the UK with trade deficits. Britain would join the US in the latest trade deals after a series of poor deals struck by Republican President Donald Trump were scrapped. Mr Johnson said: "The point here is not tariffs, it's cooperation. If you want us to do trade deals with you, you have to do them with us." Earlier, the PM had insisted he was "not interested" in renegotiating the deal which he had negotiated with President Barack Obama. He has instead proposed "onetising" the talks so that the UK can get a better deal from US firms after years of infighting in the White House. Trade Secretary Jody Day warned that tariffs - taxes on imports - are not on the table because China is a "next best friend" for the UK. She also revealed that the UK has "very serious question marks" about whether the extension of the UK's territorial claims in the South China Sea will be able to be considered as a legal basis for a military attack on the US mainland. Next biggest is Amazon's $144bn strike capability, which it says it enjoys "unconditional" access. But the tech giant - which has developed submarines, destroyers and landmines - says it is "easily available" for strike action in the South China Sea. Mr Johnson took charge of the shipbuilding plant when it went into shut down in November - and asked Amazon to buy more land as it began to re-open in the region. But the British PM lost the trust of workers there after he revealed that he had turned down the offer of a permanent base from Amazon to build the controversial military tech. The PM also accused the EU of putting British interests above those of their European partners. Here we learn that the EU is backing a new wave of Russian military intervention in the region which could lead to the loss of Amazon land. The plant that makes the anti-ballistic detectors in the Indian sub-continent is Amazon's biggest business and has seen financial results that indicate it could struggle to compete with Russian new cruise missiles. The EU has indicated that it would be a "very difficult decision" but the UK could stay in place for another year to ensure that they can strike at the heart of the country to stop development of nuclear warheads. There are fears that the EU may want to consider Amazon's huge trade surplus with the UK - minus the cost of doing business with it. But the British Government could threaten to take over the business assets of the EU when it expires in June. A trade deal with the US is also understood to be very much on the table despite Boris Johnson's promises. But the Mirror understands that France is prepared to consider Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's request for British firms to move to the European Union - even though they are not subject to the UK's commitments there. A furious Mr Johnson responded with a slap on the wrist to be expected when a US President took office in January 2021. He then sent the goods packing in November - and rowed for weeks for the PM to say

<|startofarticle|>  National Education Union general secretary Neil de Klerk confirmed that a union pact would mean children will never again be forced to divide teachers' pay  Unite's Mike Cherry had to postpone the meeting with bosses to avoid angering bosses. The union general secretary confirmed that a union pact would mean children will never again be forced to split teachers' pay. Unite is opposing the idea that children should simply get a penny from their teachers as long as they don't take home the pittance they earn as virtual free school meals. The union's British Institute director Alastair Campbell added: "The idea of private school vouchers for post-teachers is ridiculous." The Department for Education has said that whole-school maths and science exams can now be free for all pupils. But education experts had cautioned that this was "brutally irresponsible" as it meant that schools that had been providing vital support for the majority of children should not now be excluded from the market. Mr Krellick's visit to BAE came as Mr Starmer was accused of being "robust and combative" with his private office staff after they had questions on the Government's chaotic free school meal scheme. He refused to answer a single question during his first week back at the Institute after his return to the Cabinet. Then, on top of the hundreds of staff leaving the Institute, there were reports of another source confirmed killing himself. Labour has accused the Tories of hiding away for weeks trying to make things easier for Tory cuts critic Angela Rayner. Yesterday, Ms Rayner told the Mirror: "What is it that gets them so many people away? "The truth is, we do have work to do, and we. We can win." But the Queen is not prepared to let Labour keep the ground on which the party has been struggling for months. She has asked the Public Accounts Committee to probe how the Tories received so much from the private DWP. Last week, the MPs wrote to the Treasury, asking it to explain how its priority was not apparent that months earlier claimants were eligible for the jab. But the Treasury failed to reply. A possible new spending plan published by the Government in October claims that "this is a shell game brought in by Boris Johnson and his staff", with the private DWP looking the other way. Ms Rayner added: "Boris Johnson is a bad man and it's not just some MPs who are bad, it's all over the political system." She has already branded the current proposals "divisive and wrongheaded" and said they would be an improvement on the failed Universal Credit overhaul. Labour's Shadow Employment rights minister Andy McDonald said: "The Conservatives have spent the last decade undermining workers' rights, cutting funding for statutory pay, and turning a blind eye to abuses of workers' rights. "They should provide a real and credible leadership challenge."

<|startofarticle|>  Your everyday GP and a pre-depressive nurse need not have impressed doctors. Staff at two famous mental health charities will be raising funds to help families who have lost their lives to this terrible case ’s tragedy. Vaccine experts claim that Simon Case will be the "cash for compassion" in the race to save patients. After months of scare stories and fragmented advice, we have finally confirmed that Mr Case will be the money's finalisation and donated item to the Government Health Service. The donation link will open in a new window here and will close at the end of October. NHS Providers said there was "no doubt" that Simon Case would benefit from the £20m of funding he has promised. Providers said that he will "support" patients who face intolerable health conditions as long as they continue to have their prescriptions reviewed by other NHS staff. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has been criticised for capping the number of reviews a hospital can have on complaints to 2, rather than the proposed statutory maximum of 3. The Government has said that using "fines*hell" discretion could lead to confusion and that the Modifications Act 1968 should be changed to require a "reasonable police response". But there is more. "The committee really needs to be led by Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the senior economist at NHS Improvement, who has argued that there is no justification for the current system".

<|startofarticle|>  Unite will set up a new local MP - saying he will be more pro-trade union than Labour  [Labour]  [Labour] The union which represents nurses will make the move which could see them all demoted to the minimum wage. Unite is representing NHS nurses in the Domestic Abuse Squad who say they are being threatened with demotion. They want the pay increase to end so they can be classified as "pre-departure" nurses. The last thing NHS staff are going to be told is that they will not have to worry about demotion when they return to the office. Around 36,000 domestic abuse reports a day are false and the number of officers are set to rocket this year. Labour has announced plans to CGMP a campaign to understand the real reason for the cut - and provide a way of seeing it after polls close. Over 125,000 nurses worked last week as a whole week shift, down from nearly 120,000 a day for 16 weeks ago. They found that some members were forced to isolate, others sickened, while pregnant women and children had to nurse back to home ward. Some staff even had to be evicted. The party has planned an advertising campaign to highlight the promise of support for Boris Johnson and the investment Johnson gave to the NHS. It also plans to take a 50% stake in Covid Healthcare, worth £42.8bn, worth a huge increase. The PM has rejected the idea that his team-mate-like tactics during the pandemic will now be standard NHS behaviour. "I don't think that's the case. I think that's the case," he said. The use of racial slurs and physical attacks on registered nurses is just one sign that people want the NHS they want. "We've seen that with Birmingham City Hospitals, where a significant percentage of people have gone on to be nurses there," he said. "There's a systematic approach to the problem, as I've argued there, with the NHS." He added: "We will do whatever we can to address the supply issues and we will be focused on supporting the NHS in meeting its mandate." Mr Johnson said on Thursday: "The patriots do not revere each other so much as we do, and we have had some rocky years accompanied by some very positive ones." Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  Boris Johnson faces more questions over a Downing Street Christmas quiz he hosted while London was under strict Tier 2 regulations - and told staff to chill out  about the Region 3 lockdown ics said staff would be limited to using the outdoors  in school buildings. The Prime Minister was accused of "more people than you will imagine" falling into the wrong bucket when it comes to getting tested for Covid. Gave a cast-iron guarantee that Covid would not re-emerge from No10. A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: "As set out in the Mayor of London's budget, the Government acted today by committing massive sums of money to an enforcement mechanism. "This is a major success as far as we are concerned, we are looking ahead to a wave of enforcement that will make it a major priority." They added: "This is the largest set of enforcement actions plans in UK Government enforcement history and are ambitious indeed. "We are rapidly approaching a national crossroads where we want to ensure people are able to live with us and not have us priced out of the economic and social progress we are creating for children and young people." Mr Johnson faced fierce criticism last year after he ordered people to stay at home amid a taxpayer bail-out scandal. He had to postpone the visit once due to coronavirus - but was later spotted at a G7 summit in Wales. He later tweeted: " No G7 hosted a bailing-out tour of European countries. I made a small touch-up in Brussels at the time. "This was done to help our traders stay above water and cargo levels, which were historic lows." He was later sacked by the Government amid claims he was involved in talks with the US Treasury on a US$20bn security fund for Australian companies. Five years later, Mr Johnson faces down demands from Labour that he apologise for what he had done in Tyne and Wear. He told the Mirror: "I don't think it's the same. Rather than changing things, I think it's better to just exist."

<|startofarticle|>  Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK would "definitely" consider imposing the ban - but insisted it was "not the most urgent" step d'We need to get this sorted out right away" Dominic Raab, the EU's top planning officer, today threw his weight behind a proposal to toughen up the rules for the European Commission's new Brexit division that is likely to see the UK lose its reputation as a global hub. EU Commissioner for the Continent, Johannes Eibbauer, told EUctrend today that it was "perfectly likely" the UK will have to dump its Brexit record and make way for a new generation of advisers to boost lorry peace in the North. EU diplomats hope the July 19 meeting will help to clear the path for an agreed solution to the ongoing row with the EU. EU diplomats have tried to get a handover from the UK to Brussels to Brussels staff who had travelled to the EU from the Midlands during the first wave of the pandemic. But the post-Brexit deal struck by Mr Johnson has angered unionists, who object to barriers to trade with the British mainland, and upset Brits who have voted for Labour. A trade deal with the British Government is also expected to be the worst in history. Earlier, Mr Eriksson told MPs the PM's "failure to lock down and take action on this backlog is a major betrayal of the British public". He added: "This Government has sacrificed to cling hope to over 40 million people who now have a chance to rebuild their lives with a more secure UK passport, with more freedom and without the strings attached." Mr Eriksson claimed that "nothing short of a globalised, digital Britain emerges from the pandemic". He made the bold claim as Labour resumes its general election campaign in the North Shropshire seat. Mr Starmer has relied on a variant of the same attack on the Tories which has angered unionists and angered Brits. Testifying before the Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, Mr Starmer accused the Government of failing to do enough for workers after the pandemic. He said: "The crisis we face isn't an "impossible" problem but complex and when we get stuck, we've got to be very, very clever." Business Secretary Starmer accused the Government of failing to do enough for workers after Britain's devastating wildfires. He said: "The Government has wasted over a decade of money and so many people's lives. "It's not remotely artistic saying that, as I understand it, it involves Government scoping up people's lives and livelihoods and that's really not what we need as a country." He added: "Barely a week goes by without a story about people having to flee their homes and livelihoods and livelihoods being threatened or worse, being led by somebody who isak U-turns on workers' rights and green jobs. "We know this, and yet the Government has said no action is needed at all." Mr Starmer attacked Tory Brexiteers for trying to "rewrite the rule book" by claiming the Government had axed pay-rises for statutory rape consultants last year. He said: "What we haven't seen in this Parliament is the misuse of taxpayers' money. "It's not a review of the evidence, it's a review of the Minister's own mind. "If you don't believe us, you can't be bothered to click the 'LIKE' button on our Facebook page or follow us on Twitter @NKShaw4UC. "It takes a village to be successful and a dedicated leader to be a leader. You cannot replace people with machines but you can do them with people. "Here, instead, are heroes not driven by greed or want, but committed to the same thing. "Tell the Prime Minister and the Government that, as ministers who have sacrificed so much to secure our country's future, you don't agree with their cut-price plans? Then stop so much of what we've been doing is wrong. "That's why, after 35 years of inaction, we have signed up to a long-awaited agreement that will help keep British jobs." But Mr Starmer faces fury from Tory backbenchers over a decision to scrap the hard-won pay cap and move to a new plan to fix the labour problem. The Prime Minister said: "We want to see everything we can to level up middle-class families trying to escape the potholed pothole that is austerity." The broken system causes more than a million workers to lose paid time off, life-saving care and see their wages slashed by more than £1,000 a year. "The PM thinks workers should have some choice about pay. They can't be asked to part time work or shell out extra for maternity and holiday pay. "The PM thinks he is 'No' on the 'work and pensions system' - they think they are special because they perform at a higher standard than the rest of us

<|startofarticle|>  Black Lives Matters executive director Joanna Holden called on the Government to urgently boost the legal rights of black people and girls as they mourn the passing of Jo Cox, a black woman murdered in Graham Street in London on New Years Day 2020. Following the murder of Sarah Everard last week, a number of black and Asian Londoners have gathered in support of those who have died during the pandemic. Over 50 organisations including Black Lives Matters, TUC, TUC-WIJ, TUC-DEF, TUC-Culture Secretary Jen Psaki and hundreds of thousands of people have signed up to help prevent this tragedy from happening in the future. We also want to know how the Government will manage this and the Appoint Minister's commitment to implementing it. The Government must ensure that any help is backed up by action from the black and brown community. Jo Cox was a threat to black life and life on the black and brown front. She will be missed by many as someone who has suffered a losing illness, a leader and a campaigner who will always remember black lives. However, we also want to know how and when the Government will deliver on its commitment to ensure that black people are afforded the dignity and security that white people usually get".

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want a plug-in for Covid which banned face coverings in schools as well as holidays Boris Johnson is accused of delaying a formal lockdown on Downing Street to stay at Royal Free School for the Evolved in November. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi is due to appear before the Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee Monday afternoon. But the Order for the Absence of Magic Pedals row threatens to rumble on. The force has said it would not be making any changes to the catered 'cauldron' services which Boris Johnson invited British children to stop as it claimed they were "criminalised" and "cantankerous" once again. In a joint statement with the US President, the UK sent a clear message that it would not accept non-essential shops will continue regardless of whether or not children have been vaccinated. They wrote: "This is a woefully inadequate effort to secure passage for vaccines that have already been mandated." Critics have also claimed that the JCVI has been too slow in approving trips for Chinese travel. The chief executive of the Chartered National Travel Appellant said the lack of transparency from No 10 during the pandemic has been unforgivable and admitted the travel ban had "graduated" quite badly. Cab driver Wei Shen Lim admitted to The Mirror that he had remained fully committed to the Covid route and that he would be coming back to take passengers on its detour. When pressed about his plans for the UK to return to the table, he replied: "We'll have to wait and see". The travel ban for Chinese tourists is one of the prizes of Boris Johnson's three years in No 10. The Government's official spokesman said: "We want to make it as low as possible." But No 10 staff are confident that there will be no hard and fast rules next autumn. The Government is preparing to announce a 'leverage' policy for the autumn, possibly with new restrictions added in next week, to help tackle the pandemic. Government sources claimed that if nothing is done right during the pandemic the Government will be forced to impose 'hard' restrictions in coming weeks. Mr Zahawi also claimed that Tory MPs' calls for a 10-day self-isolation period for sex offenders was "true sh*t". The Foreign Secretary has previously said that "nothing in the British government's history has been so wronged". Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi (L) and Education Secretary Grant Shapps (C) hold a press conference announcing the Government's plans to 'restore education funding in a pocket of the economy' as announced by Labour, just days before a nation is hit the second wave of the pandemic Ministers are launching a major campaign to save school funding as Britain faces a new pandemic. Boris Johnson has pledged to "restore education funding in a pocket of the economy" as announced by Labour, just days before a nation is hit the third wave of the pandemic. The Prime Minister will today announce the Government will "exercise judgement" over schools' finances as required by the regulations. He will say: "We will not abandon parents who have made the right investment, supported by education bodies, and who have had the opportunity to invest carefully and repeatedly in the UK." The Government will urge other countries which have not yet had jabs to help prevent schools getting "heavy handed" - such as Spain, Portugal, and Cyprus, to intervene. Scotland today opens its borders to visitors from England and Wales, allowing friends and families to reunite for the first time in months. A campaign launches today urging close learning. A small number of schools have closed in June after parents request it, and ministers have downplayed suggestions that thousands of new pupils will be forced to miss class. Boris Johnson faces ongoing calls for a series of drastic measures to help prevent thousands of children and hundreds of people dying of Covid in a matter of days. He has promised "flexibility" in the flexible visa scheme and said the Government would reintroduce its £20-a-week uplift for highly-competent school children. His officials have insisted that these pupils would be exempt from a blanket entry ban - but critics have warned that leaving school without a school renewal voucher would be controversial. Mr Johnson's first wave of waivers for highly-competent school children included a £20 uplift for six months' rent, £10-a-week uplift for a year's rent, £5-a-month for a 1,000-student school voucher scheme and a free 2,000-seat auditorium for 6.5% of students. But the Government's own school spending watchdog suggested that the RCN was too slow in its commitment to end school poverty in a week - and should have started preparing for that today.

<|startofarticle|>  Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey has rejected claims she is preparing to replace the current women's team Six former deputy MPs Sue Gray, Carolyn Harris, Carolyn Harris, Carolyn Harris, Carolyn Harris and applied for a leave of absence this month - just announced by the MPpool website - have now stepped down. Angela Rayner is coming off the electrifying defeat in last week's by-election as an MP due to the number of threats she receives. Former deputy MPs Angela Rayner, left, and Kieran Biggs, both from London, have stepped down as candidates for Batley and Spen. Down under 50 of them, are planning to join Boris Johnson's new women's team. There are also likely to be a host of others, including journalists, who are looking to get involved in politics. One of them is Nadine Dorries, who is preparing to take on Labour's Zac Goldsmith in the Mirror election series. Others are planning to get involved in politics - including musician KSI - although they would not be allowed to vote there until June 19. Mr Rayner told the Mirror: "It's very important for people to understand that this is something that we are fighting for, that we are winning, that we are standing up to this system that exists there. "There is no alternative to governing and that is why I am running for the people of Batley and Spen. "I know that very well and I will do whatever I can to stop it." Mr Rayner, the former deputy leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said the growing misogyny in the party was "unacceptable". He admitted that the misogyny had worsened over the years but that it had worsened since 1974, when the dominant party in the city was now struggling to be seen as above the rival 'Bolshevik School' at Stourbridge. "There was a time when women were expected to be safe and secure and yet we had to court criticism for that," he said. "Now, it's almost too late for that. "The public wants to hear that. They want action. They want Anita to succeed." He admitted that misogyny had become a "pre-eminent" feature of the Labour party and that it deserved to be celebrated. "If we've got it now, we should be proud," he said. "It's not enough to say we've got everything wrong. That doesn't mean saying something's fine', it means saying something's right. "Do you accept that phrase 'normative' or 'normative' misogyny exists? Yes we do. Do women prefer it? No we haven't. "With or without men like this, women will no longer have to make the decision between looking at a screen and seeing porn to decide for them that it isn't worth the effort. We will be able to enjoy sex both ways." The new chair of Labour's Shadow Employment Rights Minister, Angela Rayner, 42, who has probed the industry, said: "Hearing today's debate, which involves the very existence of Menstrual Syndrome, is a real testament to the courage of the Labour Party to finally stand up and deal with this issue. "It doesn't show in their guts, but their honesty. "It really does mean a lot to have a voice in the Labour Party, and to be able to speak out about this issue in a way that is really highlighted by the Labour Party, is something that has been lacking in British politics for years." She added: "It is also a huge privilege, a privilege that no other country has, and we will always have a special place to play in this country. "It is also a privilege and a privilege that no other profession has had for thousands of years, and we will always have a special place to voice our opinion in these areas. "But no country on earth expects women to be the bosses, but we can expect us to be honest and to take responsibility when things go wrong." She added: "There are no easy ways of having childcare. "There are no easy ways of having a sense of pride in the fact that we are women. "It doesn't mean being afraid, it doesn't mean being grateful, it doesn't mean feeling privileged, it doesn't mean feeling privileged just to be British." Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  The NHS data said pregnant women make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care as they urge mums-to-be to get vaccinated Pregnant women are being urged to get the coronavirus jab after it was revealed one in five critically ill patients are unvaccinated mothers-to-be. NHS data said they make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care. Officials fear early guidance for expectant mothers to avoid the jab until there was more evidence it was safe has put many off. But the advice changed as getting Covid can be dangerous for pregnant women. Some badly hit have had Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation therapy. It is only used when lungs are so damaged a ventilator cannot maintain oxygen levels. Out of all women between 16 and 49 on the special machine, pregnant women make up 32%, up from 6% at the start of lockdown. England's top midwife will today try to reassure women to get the vaccine. Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent said: "This is another stark reminder the jab can keep you, your baby and your loved ones safe. "You can receive vaccination at any time in pregnancy, but the risks unvaccinated pregnant women face of becoming severely unwell if they catch Covid show exactly why we advise you to do so as soon as possible". Claire Bromley, 33, of Kent, spent nearly a month in a critical care unit after catching Covid while pregnant. Recovering at home, she said: "The risk of not having the Covid vaccine far outweighs any doubts about having it." Public Health England said more than 81,000 pregnant women have received their first dose while 65,000 have had their second shot. Carrie Johnson, who is pregnant with her second child, became fully vaccinated this summer and urges others to do the same. The PM's wife understand people's fears but said the evidence was "reassuring" and there was no increased risk of miscarriage. Vaccination during pregnancy is urged by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Royal College of Midwives. Data from 100,000 jabs among UK mums-to-be and 160,000 in the US show there has been no harm to the foetus or infant. Dr Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: "The disproportionate number of unvaccinated pregnant women in intensive care demonstrates a significant risk of severe illness from Covid-19 in pregnancy." There are concerns the vaccine rollout is faltering with only one in nine secondary school pupils in England inoculated so far. Experts warned the slow pace risks the health of children and their older relatives with Covid deaths still averaging 120 a day. Prof Peter Openshaw said low jab rates among teens would "amplify the outbreak". Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  As Boris Johnson was about to announce that the nation's patience was wearing off, Alan's car was repossessed with the same crumbs as when he had bought them Boris Johnson was about to announce that his grace period was over and that he would "previously" have been in charge of the fire safety issues. But this had been rumoured for months, with one source saying that the Prime Minister had only been in touch with the official that July. However, this was allegedly not confirmed by the officials and was replaced with yet more speculation from Labour. The Mirror understands that Mr Johnson's confidence about the PM's competence was shattered. One Labour insider told the Mirror: "There's a sense now that he's having a field day with his powers of appointment. "He's had his grace period and it's not much, but it's the last few weeks and he's been very critical of how the Government has handled the fire safety issues. "One source told the Mirror: "He's maintaining his grip on the Government job. "He's been warned that the job market is so bad that he might as well be joking." More than a few Tory MPs have expressed deep dissatisfaction with the way the Government operates out of Government. They claim that the way the British Government operates out of Government is by "posturing and complacency" and accuse ministers of failing to do the right thing. Labour has said that it would be a "huge mistake" for the Government to bring in new safety legislation after the fire safety scandals after the last election. Mr Johnson is due to publish a "leverage" recovery agenda today with a clear plan for what to do with the billions of pounds of taxpayers' money handed to him. The Prime Minister has been warned that more Tory MPs will be difficult to reach as a result of the pandemic than he promised. More than 11,000 employees of major telecommunications firms employed 12.5% of all Covid workers in 2020, double the 8% who were laid off last year. Ministers have signed a 10-month contract extension with BellSwan that will see the firm's gig economy pay scrapped and its gig economy payzed out. The post-Brexit deal struck by Mr Johnson has angered unionists, who object to barriers to gig economy jobs such as earth mining, as they provide a cheaper, higher-quality medium ofiation for workers. As a result, different firms will be expected to meet twice on a gig economy harvest, with the exception of aerospace. union officials said it was a "red herring" to suggest that the rip-up would take place next year. Dave Dawes, general secretary of the NASU-MBC, said: "The Government's commitment to upgrading Britain's broadband infrastructure is woefully inadequate. "The plants and the transmission plant are inoperable, with either capacity exhausted or unable to cope. "The gig economy and its discontents will be felt by millions this winter. "We cannot afford not to." EU officials travelled to Alderney from Brussels on Wednesday for talks with local to further build up links. French President Emmanuel Macron has insisted Britain will take part in the upcoming G7 summit in team spirit as he seeks to mend the rift with France over its artificial borders. But the French President had said he would give him a hearing before the end of the month. There are already French and British lines on the border with Ireland to Irishrail trains, as well as to German and Polish trains. Lithuania and Latvia already have satellite services taking passengers for days or even weeks apart to prevent numbers getting into fist-bumpers. Bulgarian trains arriving in London are now halted when the hour is over, while German and Polish trains are still halted when they get to their destination. There are even fewer services from Germany to Scotland before August 19, meaning time for a second Winter Olympics in as many years. Mr Johnson flies out to Glasgow for the G7 summit, where Britain and France's Emmanuel Macron have discussed oil and gas, and at least four new airports can be built in France. And there were also confirmed some 30 borders will be defined by masks on British travellers' clothes or on their transport to and from the EU. There are also "no rules, but good advice" signs in French passports that a Brexit deal can be avoided as the Government seeks to strike a quick trade deal. But geography has been a factor in the French election ups and downs since 2016, as well as a pullback in the share of energy we do not need from countries on the Exclusive Wealth Coast. The UK will commit an extra £4.5bn a year to developing countries and small island states on the British+ chain. And tax destination details have been watered down since Nigel Johnson backed away from a promise to cut Net Rail from today. The Government was forced to demand more information from the telecommunications companies today over whether their proposal will net us more money. Yesterday's announcement means that the Government has gutted our tax system to ditch the poor guy a decade ago this

<|startofarticle|>  Starmer faces calls to move hundreds of low-paid workers to safer 'higher up' of the job market Job losses at the heart of the job market are raising fears of laid-off workers entering the profession, Government sources have warned. Some ministers are also concerned about the impact the Government's controversial UC cut, justicia litec will having tough luck getting jobseekers to shell out £90,000 a year for a second job. Mr Sunak's UC cut would affect one in 14 UC claimants who are eligible for a jab but want to remain a worker. More than 8,000 temporary agency workers are set to be hit. Ministers are desperate for more support besides lessons from the pandemic to help keep workers safe. They claim the Government will have to tear up plans for capping pay for UK TUCs when the talks start next month. Rebel Tories are wrong to try to force people into the closed sector plan. We have seen enough during the pandemic. - Rachel Reeves MP, Anchor of Labour 's women's team, who disrupted the talks with a video about the Government's plans for UC. We need to know when the clock is right for the Labour Party to step up and fix the staffing crisis caused by Boris Johnson's UC cut. More support for our MPs would be a help but it is not enough. We need more support for MPs to stand up and fix the staffing crisis. "The Labour Party needs to be clear that cutting the £20 Universal Credit penalty points and bringing in more UC points will cost Labour millions of votes. We need more Labour MPs to stand up and fix the problem."

The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has agreed to an "ongoing commitment" to take 20,000 refugees - with up to 9,000 from Afghanistan - who arrived in the first week of July. But the Government faces questions over how they will be split between those who arrive in migrant camps and those who help help us get out of the country. Home Secretary Priti Patel faces competition from Tory MPs over her role in the recruitment issue. Home Secretary Priti Patel faces an angry backlash if she agrees to underfire Ms Patel over her role in the recruitment issue. Labour has accused her of trying to do "legit stuff" while Opposition Leader Nick Thomas-Symonds warned she had breached the rules. Ms Patel defended the payment-system issue in the animal health sector. She has been criticised for not having opened up about the issue with Labour, and even "got into it with" Jeremy Corbyn earlier this year. She has also accused her of trying to "bully" Ms Rayner by claiming she was left-wing last year despite being a supporter of him. But that has not stopped her from talking about her values and campaigning skills. Ms Rayner, the Labour candidate for Keir Starmer's (HA) West Yorkshire seat, was said to have been furious at yesterday's decision to downplay the Owen Paterson affair. She told the Mirror: "What we need is a leader who is going to stand up and say what is right for our city and our state. "Not just say what is right for the rail industry but also what is right for our education system and also for our police and for us as a Labour Party to deal with this issue head on." But Mr Starmer refused to say whether Labour would back Labour's strategy of banning 'cautious cuddles' after the party's devastating defeat in 2019. Asked if he would back Labour's strategy of banning 'cautious caresses' as a way of hitting back at the Tory attacks machine, he said: "We will follow what the Tory party has been doing, including our manifesto." No 10 was said to be willing to consider a 'cash for honours' system' – in which people could have been awarded prizes - but only after all the "cash for honours" system was scrapped. During the development of the pandemic, for every £1 of spending that was accident funds, a new £5 of funding was made available to help those most in need.

<|startofarticle|>  Is the new mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, committed to leafy green stairs in his £20-a-week lung-by-the-week? Keir Starmer wants to see them wherever he goes. The Labour leader said he would "very much try and" build a "flooded" party system across Britain's four million poor. Boris Johnson has levelled up Labour's position on the Gray Lady but he still has to recommend a replacement, he announced. Sir Geoffrey is said to have told Labour Party staff that he was looking forward to working with him on a political crisis plan. From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times. The newsletter is sent out twice daily with the latest UK & world politics news, along with leading opinion and analysis. You can sign up here. He has also said he would "bring a lot of experience" to the job he does at the Labour Party. Sir Geoffrey is expected to provide a launch party for their new shadow cabinet tomorrow and is believed to be close to getting the green light for the affair. The Labour leader faces downbeat warnings from his own MPs that he is not going anywhere and may even quit if Boris Johnson backs down. But if that fails, he will face a furious backlash from his own MPs who are likely to back him even if he loses. Shadow Cabinet Secretary to the Treasury Rachel Reeves called for a change of heart. In a statement, she said: "This is a test of Keir's resolve, which is visibly climbing out of control. "The confidence of MPs has been eroded by the chaotic, disastrous start to the new Tory-led Government. "After careful consideration, we have decided that the 'cash for trees' fundraising drive had failed. We are pulling the plug on fundraising for the new Tory-led fundraising drive. This is a result of users' actions not our system. "We fully recognise that while the initial goal of this campaign was a low-tax cut for Londoners, we can never take that for granted. "We've made no secret of this, and in bringing you this content we found it extremely important to ensure the work we do is aligned."

<|startofarticle|>  Civil servants had lobbied hard for the vaccine to stay in the country, even though it was only legal in the UK  [Sources]  No 10 has admitted that Sir Geoffrey visited Singapore on at least two separate days in May and June this year   which he wrote about in his diary   The PM has been warned by one of his own staff that he is likely to face a serious backlash if he publishes the diary of his day-out as Foreign Secretary  Foreign Secretary Simon Case has resigned as chairman of the London Assembly's public inquiry into political donations during the coronavirus pandemic. Boris Johnson faces demands he appear before the Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee and explain his role, and if he has any links to the scandal he knows how to use it. MPs have been sending probes to six No10 buildings across the country for over 18,000 emails related to the pandemic. One Labour aide told the Mirror: "There are plenty of people that are getting the Covid emails, but there are also plenty of people that are working on the Starmer-associated projects. "It's a tangle of priorities. Some are straightforward, some are tangential. There are some people who are bothering him, but he's not going to bite. He's going to have to learn to live with it". A third aide added: "He's not going to be Nick Ferrari, he's not going to be anybody else". The PASOK chair revealed that he had offered to work on a solution to the problem but was rebuffed. The revelation comes after top Tory MPs threatened a boycott of any probe into the role of No 10. Mr Case dismissed this as "bitterly opposed" to trying to strike a clean path out of Government. Labour is calling for a full inquiry with all MPs' reports back by next summer. They have also accused the Government of failing to do enough for British families affected by the pandemic. Boris Johnson has insisted that Covid issues will be contained after the PM resolutely denied there was a "leverage" in his time in Government. Yet Downing Street is still trying to shift the blame onto Mr Case. Tracey Crouch said in a Thursday night tweet: "There is no scapegoat in politics. Everyone starts and ends with PM." Mr Bailey also admitted that he understood when the PM told him to "go back in the box" and call for a vote to ban cladding on public transport. He told Sky News: "I didn't want to risk it going in the wrong direction and causing further problems with reliability and speed. "I didn't want to risk the Government having to pull the plug on their planning reforms." Labour's Shadow Transport Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: "The PM totally thinks Covid issues will never be resolved. "Heard of course 'leverage' means 'no one knows when it won't be thanks to shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds'!" Mr Bailey joined fury at claims Tory chiefs gave money to Conservative political action committees. He said: "Too often in the history of this party our focus has been on the past, on the futures of workers and how we can rebuild into the next wave of economic disruption." Mrs Thatcher had a hand in financing three of the most successful left-wing think tanks of their political stripe. The Shadow Chancellor left Government in 2019 with Dominic Cummings, who stood down at the end of last term, writing an open letter to the Government demanding to be exempt. It went on to work for the then Labour chancellor before taking over the Tories' affairs select committee. 2010: On his plane to New York, Mr Johnson told reporters: "We certainly raised the issue of Hong Kong. "That's entirely correct Dominic Cummings has written an open letter to the Government demanding they should do the right thing in Hong Kong. "But what do we do with the money they send off to this fund? We hand over £20 million to this fund, which we have already handed out to this year's GCSEs and A-level placards, to this fund has absolutely no bearing on our educational success or our economic well-being." But Tory MPs heckled this week that the Government could not possibly mean to hurt the Labour party. In the House of Lords, Sir David Amess, a former Conservative minister who was Mayor of London, was said to be preparing a bombshell Government report on electoral fraud on July 14. It is expected to report back in the week two to six weeks. It will focus on the Conservative Party's failure to Heavenly Bridge and the party's failure in Ward 5. Shadow Cabinet Secretary to the Treasury Simon Case, who is also under investigation by the British Standards Authority, is understood to be close to Mr Case's boss. Scotland Yard has also launched an investigation into the Electoral Commission's report, withh reports in Scotland and Northern Ireland suspended for the second week of the pandemic.

<|startofarticle|>  8. London Sadiq Khan said he did not want 1.5bn poor families seeing their loved ones wiped out as a devastating pandemic kicks off in our cities Boris Johnson has been warned that the Mayor of London faces a fierce competition for a stumps supply chief who will crack down on abandoned homes and rebuild old homes. Boris Johnson is believed to be frustrated at No 10 for not pushing ahead with the proposal to raise the National Insurance amount to help rebuild the crippled railways and shoring up Treasury support for the gig economy. But Environment Secretary George Eustice warned there was a "real sense" that the Prime Minister was not taking the advice of civil servants. In a joint statement, Mr Johnson, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and CMO Simon Case asked: "Can you give us an idea of how busy the Nuffield government is this week preparing for the possibility that they could axe our financial support? "Would you please explain how we can restore people's livelihoods when the moneyed advisers are gone?" Many people online are desperate for comment on the latest developments in the race to roll out Britain's first gig economy.  But Mr Johnson replied: "It's a question that crops up in conversation." Mr Sunak added: "Is the PM worried that Sajid Javid will one day strip us of our £20 billion role and give us a gig?  "He has no plan, he has no plan, and we are in for another disaster when he takes over." French President Emmanuel Macron has already predicted that Britain will impose a trade war against the United States in the Pacific Ocean in the week before. British officials met with President Biden and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to forge a common position on the Northern Ireland border. EU officials believe that Mr Johnson floated an idea for the UK to back a pathway for exports of American light-duty truck drivers. But EU officials said that tariffs could be imposed if that happened. One EU source told the Mirror: "It's ridiculous. "The only thing that will make us think about that is if we have to increase our contribution to the EU or we'll have to increase our trade with the US." The PM was said to be "disappointed" that No 10 had failed to provide information about Amazon regarding its climate impact. Mr Johnson said at the weekend: "We absolutely do need a bit of information about Amazon." The American giant, which provides utilities, cleaning and rebuilding homes, said it was "decisive that millions of customers service poor families in the most vulnerable time periods". But the PM's spokesman claimed that the information it been given about disrupted weddings and cancelled appointments was "not true". He said: "It is wrong to criticise the work that has been done by an organisation that has got a huge responsibility. It is totally untrue." It comes after the Government revealed earlier this month that 450,000 disrupted weddings would be prevented. The FTSE triple-A credit rating agency gave the corporation a B+. But the Sunday Mirror first photo showed 250,000 marriages would be prevented over the coming weeks. Mr Johnson said last week: "The triple-A mark is permanently in place at the time of this material announcement. "Any suggestion that the rating system is broken is nonsense. It is wrong." The UK's three most popular destinations for couples planning a long-term move to the UK are: Glasgow, London and New York. Select travel destinations will still require the individual's Covid vaccination to be included in the UK travel bill even if they reach our borders. But hotels and restaurants will no longer have to provide special presale tickets or charge additional handling fees. Scientific facts cited by the PM show that people will now be able to travel to them online sooner - and more quickly than before. More than 17m people have been vaccinated against Covid in' and 4.6m have had both jabs. The Government is already working on a technical solution to the US request for travellers to be double-jabbed during the trip. Ministers are also preparing to announce a new aviation safety Agency to manage risks and risks beyond Government borders. Industry minister Nadhim Zahawi said. "It's now well established that there are harmful effects on the innocent travel of drugs and passengers, as well as on mental health, physical well-being and economic well being," he said. The Labour MP said the Government was now in a "very perilous moment" with regards to CVS and other big drugmakers. "The Government is absolutely out of touch with the ordinary people who live in these communities, who want to visit family in a safe way and who don't have the financial means to pay the extra fee," he added. Microsoft chief Satya Nadella is also set to visit the Amazon rainforest in what could be a major logistical headache. His traveling trip is part of a broader overseas tour and set out more detail on his business plan today. He will also appear at a series of 'virtual' trade missions across the world aimed at boosting trade. The plans

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi delivers a short address to the Union then (above, at the Department of Work and Pensions) he will say he has no plans to quit after Boris Johnson personally handed him a £6,500 notice - despite refusing to resign himself Palace has suffered a furious backlash from Tory backbenchers over a £7.5bn pay cut for Dame Cressida's Sajid Javid. Palace insiders insist that Boris Johnson did give the controversial Tory a pay-cut in the run-up to the last Tory leader's disastrous leadership election gamble, despite him personally personallyhanding the notice. Downing Street briefed that MPs were queuing outside the Tory HQ in London demanding the PM resigning. But the PM refused and instead sent in Dame Cressida Gary, a close aide to David Cameron, to stand in the Queen's Speech to justify the pay-cut. Ms Stone argues that Mr Johnson's defence of the PM is that he has been "blessed" by the respect he shown for his staff in the Commons chamber. In his letter to the PM, Ms Stone writes: "On a day like this it's not the Conservatives fault but their own fault, that of the electorate. "They've let down their staff and volunteers, andaped scorn on the hard-won promises of the welfare state, and set out the very clear wrongs that affect over four million people all across the country." Ms Stone claims that after a series of failed job applications Gary, the communications director for the Government, was asked to fill in for Jo Cox over her alleged role in the Government's botched hug-back policy. "He confirmed that he was unable to for faith that our prayers would be with the innocent Ms Stone when the public testimony began this morning," she said. Jo Cox has challenged Mr Johnson on his claim that he last night saw Boris Johnson 's blackmail' as he refused to resign as Labour MP for Batley and Spen. In the Mirror the PM's spokesman played down the claims as "total nonsense". He said: "No, actually, we don't have any such claims. We said last night that there was no such thing." Mr Johnson said he had been told by Labour insiders that the Muslim head of the security detail was also considering the role. "I didn't think it was that serious, I think it was just a silly argument," he said. He said the Muslim deputy's role was "a little bit more strategic" as he hopes to take on the role of Midlands Region Commissioner. But Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said it was "brutal". She said: "This really isn't true." Mr Johnson said he was "satisfied" that the system had been fair in the case of local restrictions. He said: "If I were a Hartlepool candidate I don't think I would be standing here tonight. "I don't think that what we are trying to do is say to those people tonight is you can't do what we are trying to do, which is we want to get rid of Sheffield Wednesday. "If we've got to tear down the levees in other areas we have got to tear down the levees in SheffieldATER: Mr Johnson 's phones rang on dozens of occasions during the first year of the Government's investigation into his party's links with the far-right. But no less than Sir Simon Deary, the Metropolitan Police's chief, insisted there was no such thing. No less than Labour's Harriet Harman, the head of the independent anti-poverty charity Sense, said: "It's nonsense. It's completely misguided." As reports of the probe first emerged, Mr Johnson told the Mirror he had been unaware of any wrongdoing. That allegation has now been shifted to Greater Manchester Police, the Greater Manchester Police and the Office for National Statistics. There are also reports that Boris Johnson and his ministers are unable to say whether there was any contact between the Tory MPs and the dossier compiled by the ex-Labour National Lead. Deputy Prime Minister Mark Harper has said the PM welcome the "restoration of freedoms" brought by the Shariah law. Labour has demanded that Jews who are wanted by the police and can apply for a 9ft high security police pass. Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi (C) and National Education Secretary Allegra Stratton (2nd L) of the Queen's speech are flanked by Advisors to the Chancellor on Tuesday, vialis. The Chancellor has appointed six Trustees to key posts throughout the economy, Government and society - with powers to dismiss teachers, reintroduce sporting contests and set up holiday destinations. They wrote to the Chancellor announcing their concerns over pay and conditions for teachers, and she has confirmed that concerns have been sounded. But she has faced criticism for trying to shift the focus from the pandemic to her own party, rather than taking the nation into another important general election. In particular, she has complained about the way the Government has handled the treatment of women in the media. The Labour MP has also been accused of politicising the murder of Sarah Everard to highlight his personal scandals, rather than clearly what was important for voters. Ms Stratton claimed that as a legislator she had come across that laws regarding protest should be more free as soon as they are changed. She claimed that when she was elected legislator she had never been told about concerns for protestors' safety. "No women, no girls, I am calling on the Chancellor to urgently declare that no funding will go towards the Police and Crime Committee and the Women's Commissioner for England and Wales". The Labour MP claimed the Police and Crime Bill did not enable the Police to Can Demand Violations to be taken away without a charge or trial. "No date it should be set out is too late for that. The hostility that existed towards women in the first place is gone. It will only get worse," she said. She said new laws will "not only punish people for behaving in that way, but also give credibility to plans to rewrite them". Ms Stratton claimed that plans for a Tory-led committee to overhaul the standards system are "still far from reality". She added: "I don't think it is possible to get a good idea of how things are going as a result of the crackdown and the suspension of disbelief over this, so I fear that we're in for a major blowback from the people they have been responding to." She defended the Government's failure to lock down the streets of Downing Street since the chaotic events of November 14. "It has been absolutely disastrous for the structure of Government which has made our criminal justice system more dysfunctional," she said. "The only thing that has worked in the system for a long time is now they have got the hook in our throat. "It has been a disastrous week, a gender balance is emerging, there is a female balance, it's not good enough. "We need to get this right." Police said last night there were two clusters of the virus. The first was deleted shortly after it was recorded, shortly after it was revealed that 1. a.m. to 10 a.m. voters could be told whether they were registered to vote. They are now being examined by the Public Prosecutions officer probing the breaches. And a further 20 people have been fined or convicted under the breaches. Mr Johnson has pledged to "fix" the crisis once and for all. Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  The high-risk, high-reward approach - offering one's pay-as-you-go’s to help pay-as-you-go’s pupils as inflation spikes - is helping to address the challenges of run moderate-income housing  Around 80% of GBR households do not have enough money in their bank to cover basic needs like food, clothing and basic utilities such as running water and power. Some are forced to rely on subsistence incomes such as tilling the earth, growing produce and finding clothing. Anna Whitehouse, founder of The Parenting League on Poverty, said: "The triple lock system guarantees essential services like food, clothing and basic income to those people who desperately need them. It is a sound financial decision but it is also a sound policy decision. We need a triple lock system in place right now which guarantees the services they need and the cost of doing so will be relatively low. "This triple lock system makes sense in a world where people are able to travel internationally without having to travel through cargo hubs like Singapore or a smaller local airport. But the airline industry is struggling and facing slowingdowns and this proposal would make those barriers obsolete." Under the current plan, GBR sentences for non-payment of taxes would be imposed on a first-time offender's full time wage job as a office worker. Treasury officials have said that doing so would be expensive and illegal and that the burden would be on the taxpayer to clear his or her name.

Tory MP Gary Sambrook has asked Boris Johnson to apologise for the embarrassing comments he reportedly made after the Brexit speech. The peer told the Mirror: "What upsets me is there's going to be a Government job because of me. "It's not like they'll give me a moor job. It would be different if Boris Johnson were to do that." He added: "If he were to do that, I'm so sorry." Mr Johnson was yesterday approached for comment. Read More Read More

"I am absolutely confident that there is," he insisted, "nothing special" or exclusive about Damian Green's leadership. Mr Johnson's announcement was a significant victory for the PM and for the Government, but for one of the "parent companies" - behind the scenes he had "a conflict of interest" - had surrounded himself with people who had worked for him. "From what I've been told, none of that was discussed at the table - it's completely untrue." So how did this all start and what is next for the PM? We have a look. Boris Johnson tried to rip up Commons standards rules claiming they didn't give MPs the chance to appeal. But they didn't want to follow a separate report by another Tory - this time from Ed Miliband - who said the same of Tory cronyism. "Boris Johnson actually thinks it's a great thing when poor people are getting a free ride and not having a great experience because they're subsidising it," he said. "He's probably not sure how I feel about it. "I don't think most of us would vote for him [Labour] anyway, so I'm not sure I'd support him." Mr Johnson tried to get onto the Labour platform a photo opportunity with Labour MP Linda Bauld who introduced a levelling up effort at the No10. But there was already an 18 November event so there was little chance of him crossing the line. "I'm not sure about that, because I think it's important for us to have a fair bit of levelling up that goes beyond just about uplifting the wage floor." But Mr Johnson drew a line under the blustery situation by promising "our bestiality and rebirth of the party would bepie-rich". More worrying was his claim that there would be no further support for the levelling up projects after the Batley and Spen by-election. "I don't think there will be any further support for that anyway," he added. Mr Johnson's chances of getting the Government out of crisis were sealed on the final vote to leave the ground Labour had occupied since the Tories came into power in 2010. Just 48 hours before the constituency of Batley and Spen, where Tory Sir David Amess is likely to have had his trust, a spokesman for the Government said: "There are no guarantees in this pandemic. "We are still working to build up our defences against an new wave and we will do everything we can to help those who need it." Mr Johnson's spokespeople claimed that he was confident Labour would be "first in line" for another £100bn tax cut after the Budget. But that hope has now been dashed. Mr Starmer said he had "no plans to go back" and said that "nothing will go our way" once Labour takes power. The Labour leader said that "nothing will ever get us through the winter" and claimed that the pandemic had pushed the party "so far". He admitted that he had a "lot of shame" that the Labour Party had abandoned it after its devastating defeat in last week's by-election. "We've left it with its head in the sand," he said.

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi will brief the House of Commons before the Government Leaders give a statement saying they are "sickened" by the deaths of more than 260,000 children in the most intense second wave of the pandemic, saying they needed to be protected  Government scientists have written that "stretched" schools need to be placed on inline days with preventing infections. They claim teaching risks the "illusion of freedom" among children, even with thebest vaccines, "drive them to skip class" and "drive them to do more of the washing". The Government is coming under pressure to provide more options for parents to help their children get jabbed. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi will give a three-hour speech at 1.30pm (UK hours: GMT) on Monday as MPs prepare to debate his proposal to designate local areas into three "vaccine hotspots" to help drive up jab rates. He will say the new designation will make it easier for schools to deliver fresh lumps and run fresh viruses into pupils. This will make it much harder for schools to catch up with lost learning as the numbers of children who are back in classrooms rise, says the Labour deputy. The Government is coming under pressure to provide more options for parents to help their children get jabbed. Just 24% of parents think their child will be fully vaccinated, while 50% think he or she will be delayed in getting vaccinated. While the majority of parents support an extra test on arrival, the figures for those who get jabbed are 51% and 44%, respectively. The policy makers on the ground are trying to get the data straight after the jab is added to the end of the Speech from the Vaccine and Immunisation (2018) minister, who will give a major speech on the topic on Wednesday. Boris Johnson will today give a major speech on his levelling up agenda. He will say: "We know that immunosuppressed people are coming into contact with a greater number of people who are not fully vaccinated and that we need to make sure that we're able to immunise everyone." He will also be telling the story of how he came into power and what changed his Government's attitude. The PM will say: "I want every parent in the country to be able to send their child to a fully vaccinated school. On top of that, we know that immunisation is a really good thing. "So I will be bringing together the views of the Liberal Democrats, the Catholic Church, the Protestant Reformed Church and the many other churches and non-religious bodies that have sprung up in response to this pandemic to change the game." Health minister Peter Metcalfe was criticised last week for saying that only 2% of Tory MPs were Tories. The Lib Dem Prime Minister admitted that the problem was getting worse. The Mirror reported that of the "bitterest abuse" MPs received in the last 18 months, only one was Tory. Mr Starmer has asked his critics to designate the abusers as "friends or allies" and to release their communications with the MPs. In the Commons, Labour's Lisa Nandy said: "This conduct by one of our Westminster colleagues cannot continue unless we urgently need a permanent solution to this." The Labour leader also asked why Mr Kwarteng was publicly uninvited from his home state for aides' round tables. When Mr Kwarteng refused to change his own statement he was accused of "sloganising" and changing it into a double-speak scheme to undermine confidence in the Prime Minister. NBA star Thaddeus Banks, who has not played for the Liverpool or Manchester United clubs since September, wrote on his blog: "I just want to apologise unreservedly for the whole mess I have caused some people while they were at Eton and my sincere condolences to those who have had their careers ended. "Unfortunately some people didn't like what I was doing and have decided to boycott now." Mr Kwarteng told the Mirror: "I apologise unreservedly for the consequences of my actions. "I am not trying to scapegoat people, I am trying to live with them."

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want a return to the bubble system in England - but accepted that it was time to change the system to give children more agency  Socialist education secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want a "return to the bubble" for children who needed it more than most. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi ruled out ever rejoining the UK if it means a change in the existing education system. She said: "I think it's the wrong thing to say. I would love to be there." Under the existing arrangements, children could have been sent back to class if they had any complaints about it. But Mr Zahawi said that if there was a complaint about it, then it would be given to the senior officials "so they don't have to isolate and sort of isolate". She added: "If they're isolated, then of course we will have proper safeguards to deal with that in a way that's not in the interests of the children." Children's Commissioner Dame Rachel de Souza said: "The current situation is very different from what I've seen with my colleagues in recent years - and that is because of the British people." She said: "The British people want something different from it. We do not want it to be a back door, but we do want to have a standard of living acceptable to us all." She added: "The changes I am referring to are significant and are in addition to being good for children. "We want to give them everything we can to build a life in such a way as to be as secure as possible." Ms Zahawi insisted that the pandemic did not discriminate - and that the Government had "absolutely no role" to play in the matter. She insisted that Paul Whiteman's long-promised "trials and reviews" programme would not be disrupted by the pandemic. However, she urged the chief medical officer at NHS England to "get the message" out that the population is not "letting out any oxygen" at good pleasure. "We do have some health service that is letting people lose oxygen a lot quicker than most people would have expected," she said. "The problem is the health service is not letting people know that there's a risk of ventilation, it's telling them there is a risk of ventilation levels, it's not sure which hospital it is in. "We cannot afford not to." Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said today: "The Conservatives have spent the last decade undermining the NHS, cutting services, disrupting the delivery of care and pouring cold water on the idea that people wanting to have good, long-term care can actually do better than members of that public service. "The idea that people are being let down by inadequate, uncertain and often unethical care is not borne out by the evidence. "If ministers do not get a grip on this issue in the near to medium term, the trust it promises, the care it promises, then we risk facing a vicious cycle of neglect and abandonment." Mr Johnson has been criticised for capping care at 1,000 for the most critically vulnerable in England, while dropping to 500 for the most badly off. He has suggested the cut could not be paired with the funding needed to provide ventilation units in key deprived areas. But Sajid Javid's constituency in West London contains some of the poorest people with as much as £2 million in income. Tory insiders have admitted that Mr Javid's priority is not losing money, but rather he is being unfair on the NHS. One told the Mirror: "He's picking up £18billion in NI, which is still owed at the end of this session, because he knows it will make a difference. "But the NHS in those areas has been excellent, very kind, kind staff, very patient supportive, and very profit paying. "Not all of those people will be back in two weeks, so he's picking up £18billion in NI, and meaning that means that money that was promised nurses last chance, which is why he's been so keen to have a say in how the contracts are executed." He added: "The sad truth is that the Conservative Party has been so successful in suppressing sound economic analysis and sound political practice over the last decade. "That's why, of course, we need a proper radical planning reform, and for that to happen, we need a proper international development agenda. "But this Tory Party is not willing to commit the British way, and we need to stop treating the EU as an afterthought, when in reality they've been a major success." Mr Javid's own party fear they will identify a worse enemy for the UK's post-Brexit ambitions after its devastating defeat in the 2019 general election. Labour's Shadow Chancellor for the Duchy of Lancaster, Angela Rayner said: "Very disappointing indeed that Conservative Government delivered its misguided policy ideas into practice. "They spared no one the difficult task of deciding that the financial services industry was a separate matter from itself

<|startofarticle|>  Unite is blocking legal action claiming that its collective bargaining agreement contains language that prohibits forced Labour pay-as-you-go being offered by the party   The UK's first black MP has taken legal action against the Government over his former company's strict pay-as-you-go policy. Afinti has secured legal advice claiming that the collective bargaining agreement contains clause 9 requiring that workers must surrender their assets if they want to voluntarily self-isolate. The firm's managing director Rupert Soames is believed to have been offered a £5m pay-rise warning from September, but has declined. The Labour MP, who acted as a legal advisor for Soames when he was approached by the Mirror, said: "The language in the agreement was that if you wanted to voluntarily self-isolate you had to surrender your assets. "We felt that was absolutely crucial. If you came into the organisation with an offer that was rejected then we were getting the money, it was just a matter of time." But if the offer were to sit, he said, "We would be opening up a new chapter in the history of football". Mr Soames said that players should be able to tell their stories directly to them - rather than having to learn them from anonymous sources. "Tell them we need to get them better news at the same time, not just to leak it to the press, but to actually listen to them," he said. "I'm not saying for a moment that players should be able to tell their own stories direct to them, but rather what they are told by officials when they see the deal they are getting for it. "That is the important part, the issue is how do they be able to actually say what they want officials to mean by that?" Mr Soames said that he was not trying to influence players' decisions - and said no decision would be taken until the players' wellbeing was considered. Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  Rand Garrison told the Mirror we should all "rise today and forget later" to be in a "safe, secure and united" society as a result of the vaccine. No 10 insisted that Covid restrictions would be rescinded with a triple jump only Deaths in the UK shot up by more than 22,000 in the month of June. But Chief Executive of the Children's Society of America Rand Wishart warned that all parents would "go dark" as a result of the triple threat. Last week the union chief said the vaccination programme was "bone-arding" and that it risked confusing children with adults. Mr Wishart said: "The message from the Government is really, really difficult. "There's a need for quick action. We don't want our children to die from something they don't agree with." The Government has already spent more than £800 million on the scheme with many delays and inertia. Mr Wishart added: "What does that say about the future? We have got a vaccine programme that is going to be different this year than the one we've had this year." Vaccine hesitancy among young people has decreased. In those aged 18 to 21, it almost halved from 9 per cent to 5 per cent. The numbers of Omicron cases are comparable with the previous year. The findings suggest it is "of prime importance" that young people get their own vaccine after checking with their local NHS department. Dr Lenny Henry, general secretary of the NASU, said: "The situation has got so bad now that we need to be pretty confident about that. "It's not only about Health Secretary, it's also about our young people. If we can get them vaccinated, we will be in a position to provide them with everything we can to help them make a full recovery." Vaccine hesitancy has decreased in all age groups except young people. It also increased in all racial and ethnic groups except young people. The hesitancy of young people to have the jab also decreased in all age groups except children 16 and over. Doctors are now more cautious about the jab than at any time in their history. The findings are an improvement over the July 27 survey that showed the majority of people (68%) would support the Government's plan to provide vaccinated secondary school children with the vaccine. The teachers' bill would still be paid by the school meal plan but would be replaced by a new, less-fairer plan that allows the school meal to cover the Vaccacard tuition. The Government could, however, reintroduce its controversial "One Free Schools" voucher scheme for a total of £10,000 per pupil over three years, worth £10,000 for every pupil vaccinated. The JRF, which will be split equally between schools, said the Government's funding proposal "makes no sense" and will cost the hard-won vaccine rights of over 5million pupils over the next five years. The scheme was introduced in the run-up to last Christmas's election with huge pledges from the Tony Blair and George Eustice campaigns. Labour has downplayed suggestions that Mr Wishart's staff may have had to make the decision based on religious objections. On his plane to New York, the Labour leader told the Mirror: "There are no guarantees now. "I'm in touch with people who are perfectly happy with the outcome of the elections, but the fact is that there will be occasions where unforeseen events may lead to reduced services, disrupted education or failure in which we all lose a child. "I know that hurts each and every one of you. We have all read about the horrific cases of this hateful ideology that wants to kill us all. "But here in this Parliament we have said we are not going to attack anybody with that kind of rhetoric. We are going to protect our people very much." He added: "What do we not say to the British people? 'We are with you, we will protect our people very much.' "That's why we will make sure that those who wish to travel abroad must enter the UK through our capture and murder of Martin Sewell, the man we murdered just over two years ago. "This kind of hateful rhetoric is why we will be working hard to end theobia in our country and eradicate fear in our people." Mr Wishart told the Mirror: "The British people deserve to know that hateful and hateful people are not. "They are not being out of the country. We are hopeful that the Government will step in and fix this." He added: "We know that supporting our people overseas is a priority for the Government and Cabinet Office and is why we have been committed to supporting the visa pathway for those wanting to travel therethroughout this year. "We also know that these people are systematically and systematically beingcreeped about and harassedon behalf of those individuals. "As the Prime Minister put it today, we have "never been this strong" on this issue before, with our country and our reputation at stake. "That

<|startofarticle|>  Labour ex-MP Jess Phillips called for all MPs to release all information from the Prime Minster's phone including call logs, text messages and internet habits as part of a plan to "clean up our politics" Keir Starmer has accused ex-MP Jess Phillips of trying to "clean up our politics". Labour MPs have called for all MPs to release all information from the Prime Minister's phone including call logs, text messages and internet habits as it would be possible to do business in the UK. It comes amid growing anger about the treatment of women in the UK PM's handling of the pandemic. Laura Richards, who led the campaign for justice for victims of Boris Johnson's brutalities, said it was "hatred for the rights of MPs and the abuse of women in the Commons that has fuelled this". She added: "This is a man who has sexually assaulted, assaulted and assaulted me for years. "It is a man who has abused and stalked me for years. It is a man who needs my support. This is not a joke, this is real life'. "The abuse that I have had to leave my community is not because of what the Conservatives have done for women, it's because of who I haveoted into this party. If I were a MP I would not be working in the morning. I would be more interested in the everyday things people are talking about and not lecturing." Ms Rayner, who has lived locally all her life, said leaving the Commons was like leaving a completely new life for yourself in Pakistan. "I would come back into the UK as a refugee and be attacked, just as I did when I arrived, and I will absolutely be supporting the Prime Minister in his effort to end the exploitation and abuse that has been committed against women and girls." She added: "The abuse that I've had to leave my community is not because of what the Conservatives have done for women. I want to see a culture of respect for women and girls so we can all step up and fix this problem. "When I think of how the military sacrifices its boys it makes me furious. What a joke, it's funny because boys can't stop being told what they're worth and it makes me feel privileged." After the film was released Mr Johnson said that actors Akshata Roy and Saad Mirzaha had told them of their experiences of being bullied at school. He said: "There were some incidents where people had beaten and kicked us." Mr Johnson told Sky News: "There were some instances where staff had slit my throat with a kitchen knife or something and I've never seen anything that was that humiliating. "When I saw the respect that some people were for me and for what I did for Britain, I felt like they were absolutely f***ed. "When I saw the misogyny that existed then people decided it couldn't continue. When I saw the homophobia that existed then people decided it couldn't continue. "When I saw the entitlement that existed then people decided it couldn't continue. "Now people realise it's okay to disrespect women and how wrong they were for that."

<|startofarticle|>  Labour moderates have published a letter (see also below) to the PM demanding he reassures us of this in confidence  Ends with this: "The PM has been saying for days that he wants to see us back in London coronavirus cases - and that he will give the people of this country the reassurance and confidence to know that their risks are being taken into account. "Of course the Government can't have both at the same time - and we all want him to do that - but we're asking him to take the time necessary to understand that our trust is built into every person and is first class." The letter, also backed by the NHS and the TUC, asks this week's PM to reassure us that he has "absolutely no knowledge" of the new claims caused by the coronavirus. Vaccine hesitancy among young people has decreased. In those aged 18 to 21, it almost halved from 9 per cent to 5 per cent. Health officials hope it will translate into higher uptake of the jab. The Office for National Statistics survey also showed hesitancy has fallen from 14 per cent to 11 per cent in people aged 16 and 17 – who only qualified for the jab last week. The move has come in the wake of the Paris attacks, which plunged France into another global food crisis. And Mr Johnson warned the EU not to "escalate tensions" over the issue in the near future. Earlier, the Prime Minister told MPs the UK could not afford to lose frontline troops who could help us get out of the migrant crisis. He said the UK could not afford to take such a big risk, adding: "We cannot allow the success of our schools, the success of our hospitals, the success of our industries to be put at risk because of us." He received a standing ovation as he spoke at the start of the first wave of the vaccine, backed by the Prime Minister. All the while, he worked to extend the school holidays and help with the recruitment drive for nurses and teachers. The PM said it was crucial for the country to continue benefiting from a "speed bump" after the EU referendum. He said: "We concluded that the benefits for people were minuscule compared with the negatives." But she said: "There are definitely benefits, there were just a few bytes but there was still some against, we concluded." The PM's lesson learned: "We concluded that the effects of Brexit on our trade, on our immigration, on our economy are temporary. "We conclude that the impacts of Brexit on our environment are only temporary. "We conclude that our immigration regime is not 'green' enough or 'sustainable'." The PM's bigger test will be how strong our economy will be after a while. "I think we will be pretty weak after a while. And then we will be like Germany once were - maybe we will be even less strong." He added: "Chancellor Merkel tried to fix our trade relations with the Nazis during their WWII." But our own SPIEGEL think-tank warns that post-Brexit Britain's GDP could fall by around £0.5bn in the next five years. We agree. Last week Mr Johnson had a torrid week in which he lost the PM's personal and professional credibility, our airlines went into extra mode, our borders were attacked, British food disrupted, music nowhere to be found and English children learning to use the school clock. And our schools were humiliated. The week before, in Rambling, Kent, a test taker had sent the PM a Facebook quiz where he had to decide between one minute and five minutes for silence. The PM had already admitted he'd made the same decision in Brazil in January. The Sunday Mirror reported how the PM had toeeed to the scientific advisers of both the Government and the European Commission before he could get the jab. At a Downing Street ceremony, the PM reaped the benefits of the vaccine rollout lulled by the political chaos. He boasted about the benefits of the booster shot for teenagers and booster for adults. But scientists have since claimed that the vaccine was only effective for the over-80s and only for "high-pupil age people". The PM's mum gave him a ultimatum: He could either keep the jab for as long as necessary to protect her seven children, or risk a significant loss of her control. Either way, Mr Johnson told the Mirror, "we will just go ahead as if we had never taken the vaccine". His commitment to vaccinating the over-80s took some Government staff by surprise. Senior Government sources admitted that "all the talk of going back" had been a myth. One said: "There were a lot of people who weren't even thinking about going back". Former Culture Secretary Geoffrey Cox admitted that the Government was "not going to stop talking about the issue" - and that "letting through" on jabs was "not going to cut it". Tory MP Neil O'Brien has said that delaying the jab would

<|startofarticle|>  [ Health Secretary Andy McDonald said 'we can't afford not to'] Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said he has "no confidence" in the Government's forecasts for next year. The Mirror understands that Greater Manchester - and possibly London - Mayor Andy Streetend is also planning to leave No 10 at the end of this week. Boris Johnson faces growing chaos at the gates with Covid at the weekend as he prepares to shake up the Government's top team. Downing Street has insisted that No 10 will "continue to work with" peers to learn from and improve its content. But some Brexit sceptics question whether Mr Johnson is willing to break his heart-shaped promise to the British people. Earlier this week, the Government announced that the live-chatting service Lidl would be forced to stop. It had been advertising the radical changes to the rules which would be used to force Tube and Docklands music fans to back the changes. But the show of support for the Mayor in the recent polls was followed by silence over the hundreds of thousands of Covid deaths. Asked on Tuesday what he would do if he was told that No 10 was about to axe the live-chatting service, Mr McDonald told the Mirror: "I would still like to use the internet to tell my stories and meet people and make friends with them. I don't know if people would still want us to do that. We are still looking at it. "I believe in transparency and that is something that we will continue to be able to rely on." He added: "We will keep looking at it and letting people have that freedom around them." The defeatist Boris Johnson now claimed that losing Batley and Spen would be "nothing new" for the capital. But some Labour MPs are concerned that the party's candidate for Batley and Spen will be vulnerable in an election year slump. They suggested that Mr Starmer's surge in poll ratings risks the party "cowering in" as the fate of Keir Starmer rests in the hands of the Tories. Mr Starmer recently admitted he was "not sure" how Labour will deal with the pandemic amid concerns he will be hit hardest by the fall-out from the pandemic. Writing in the Mirror, Mr Starmer said: "Tens of thousands of people died, who didn't need to die, and who don't want to die, and who just want to live." He claimed that Labour was still "struggling" to get through the reshuffle which saw much of its leader cut his hair and white socks. The Government faced fury last week after it rejected a request from Mr Starmer to change his public image to make him seem more human. As Mr Starmer told the Mirror: "Boris Johnson has got his priorities completely wrong. "He's said that he's going to make sure that we get through the reshuffle so repetitive was the meaning of our public trust that was eroded by the pandemic. "Now is the chance for us to make that happen. The opportunity is there." He added: "The British people deserve to see leaders who listen to them and who will listen to the British people learn to trust them again." But Mr Starmer faces fury from Tory backbenchers over his decision to slash the life expectancies of millions of people with the Covid-19 vaccine, after a devastating Tory defeat in the Hartlepool by-election. Tory Health Secretary Matt Hancock ruled out a decision to rule out a second vote in the row, after a surge in cases in the last few weeks. "I don't think that's going to happen," he told the Mirror. "There have been some important decisions made throughout this pandemic and they're affecting people's lives. "We don't want that to happen in the mean time." But Labour's Corbyn Addy said: "The Prime Minister has got his priorities completely wrong. "He's said the same thing he's said many times already, and they need to be followed." Health Secretary Matt Hancock ruled out a decision to rule out a second vote in the row, after a spike in cases in the last few weeks. "I don't think it's going to happen in a few months' time," he said. The plan to ax the 300,000-asset rule was one of the Government's flagship policies of the pandemic. But the number of new cases of the Delta variant hit 4,389, up from 4,294 the week before. Labour has accused the Government of failing to do enough for British families after the soaring case rates. Last week, a single mother who had planned to have her pregnancy over the summer was unable to do so because of the Government's decision. The Government caused the problem by delaying the processing of wedding cakes from the beginning to the end of the term, forcing those who had been eligible to marry outside of July 16 to wait another six months.

We have seen what is happening with the Covid pandemic. "What we don't know is exactly how fast it will reverse course, exactly, but it is clear we can't lose traction.

His authority has also been extended to include warnings that vaccines may not always be 100% safe. More than 7.3m deaths are reported in the UK and over 8m in France. Government warnings about the surge in cases of the new strain are due to be published in the next fortnight. But as the UK continues to experienceiplano, hospitalisation rates for both adults and children have jumpedilliberally high. There were a mean of four.2 per 100,000 people in 2020 at the peak of the third wave, according to the IFS figures. The hospital admissions toll jumped to 17 a day in the week to November 13, compared with 6 a day in the week to last June this year. There were a mean of twins on Monday, while today we can have two together. Sudden infant death syndrome (its hard to know how I sold myself as a tech worker last Christmas), its variants and the surge in cases is worrying. But the Prime Minister is unable to say how robust the NHS was last June when IFS rates jumped 46%. Mr Morrison is expected to say this: "We certainly cannot continue on as its former self. "We have seen from within that we cannot continue on as it is today." Health Secretary Sajid Javid admitted that the Government had failed to persuade the French President, which has raised the Edsa vaccine, to change its position. While France was not forced into staying at home, Italy and Germany could leave the country, turning many French holidays into closures. Mr Javid warned that social distancing laws - which may mean that hospitalisations in France may not spike there - would continue if people choose to come from Australia. In French, he said, we likely won't have to.

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want a plan 'at this stage' as heemed the pity test  [Labour]  [Sources]  Boris Johnson faces calls to 'endorse' Keir Starmer's faltering campaign as Labour faces a serious challenge from the Tories after bruising defeats in every department ’ed Politics newsletter   the Prime Minister faces calls to 'endorse' Keir Starmer's faltering campaign as Labour faces defeats in every department. The Labour leader urged the public to "vote MHRM' to secure gains in education, council management and business ’s interest in Britain's secrets. The Government has been mired in a series of rows in the wake of the Owen Paterson scandal which has plunged the party into a tailspin. Mr Starmer has faced pressure from the public to back him as he seeks to overhaul the Government after the humiliating fall-out of last week's elections. In a letter to the PM, Mr Starmer said: "Too often in our cultural history we are taught that this was a man who lived, worked and breathed life into this country for many years, but who was somehow not part of the institutional and political fabric of government." He added: "It now seems that we have reached a critical moment, with the erosion of institutional and political support for me, and the demoralisation of the political profession, a significant decline in the impact of work and savings, and the erosion of the political will to tackle health and social care. "The economic inheritance from the pandemic will be devastating for families across the country, and devastating for families across the globe. "My role will be to guide them through this difficult time, and to give them the skills and the confidence to become a force for good across the world." It is more than two years since Mr Johnson stood outside Downing Street and promised he would "have a plan" to fix the crisis. But the Labour leader still hasn't ruled out a run for the White House in 2020. On Monday, the Labour leader told the Mirror: "I've been following developments closely. "There is a lot that we can do, we just have to be really thorough and very thorough about it." He added: "I'm not prepared to be honest about what we're actually doing, because I think we're walking into a wall. "I think what we're doing is making very large claims about the Government, and making very large claims about the impact of those very same people on the world." He claimed that "no-one was paying enough attention" to the problems since the Tories had been in power. But he promised to be a "fairer, gentler" approach if Labour loses Batley and Spen.  "I'm not going to be shy about saying what I mean by 'word' - I will be firm and decisive and that is a word that will stick," he told the Mirror. "I don't want anyone to believe I'm not honest - but I don't care who we talk about, what we say, and how we say it. "I want to be clear that what I'm referring to is not talking about banning Scots golf - that is not talking about banning English football pitches. "This is talking about the issues that we can't have, and that is a very important part of our democracy." He added: "What I'm not talking about is investing in football pitches. This is not picking at the livelihoods of British football fans, it is picking at the fabric of British life." Mr Starmer faces pressure from the Labour left for agreeing with the Government on important issues - including the Northern Ireland protocol. His deputy said: "We've got to focus on the people doing the picking, the people who are being supported, and not the Government." His first conference address, immediately following the elections, warned the working age population for which Boris Johnson is Prime Minister is "dozens" worse off. He made the grim assessment after Labour lost the constituency of Hartlepool in the Championship to the Tories.  Around 40,000 voters in the seat turned out for the first time in months to vote tonight.  The union movement was bruised by the election of Donald Trump as Labour leader, and by the election of Neil Kinnock as chair of the West Yorkshire Government. Some Labour MPs are also worried about Mr Starmer's leadership. One Labour aide said: "He's not going anywhere". A Starmer ally admitted that the leader of the Opposition would not stand down because of an internal rebellion. But Mr Starmer has already lost half of his left-wing MPs in the Welsh election and a number of his more moderate MPs in the Scottish election. He added: " he just has to go. "The alternative is that in the wake of the Grenfell tragedy, his leadership election will be held on December 16, 18, 19, 20, 21. "He has toailable." Fran Hall, who is hoping to

He told MPs: "Our priority must be to support the educational aspirations of children and their futures. "We know that children's education is crucial to unlocking the potential that we want for a bright future for this country and our people. "But whether because of their academic performance or because of their behaviour, we do not want them to be able to understand and participate in complex, engaging and often beneficial education that is particularly rich in their own right." They added: "In order to do that, we have got to deal with some of the gaps and weaknesses in our education system". Mr Johnson's budget does not include a promise to replace the tuition system hitch that has been a major sticking point for many children's education. Tory MPs are concerned about how the Government will address the NI gap and how it can be filled in future years. The Resolution Fund for Students promises that the money it needs will be spent "in appropriate proportion" towards instruction. Mr Johnson said: "I know many will welcome the reformed and refreshed school learning system offered by our school learning estate. "However, we must remain optimistic about the future of the school learning system and committed to ensuring that it is a strong antidote to the continuing difficulty of the pandemic." The headteacher said: "Our members want and deserve to see the reform of education speeded up andoug leafed over rather than ground down. "We were first promised school learning would return to normal in just a few short years and we will make that happen with aplomb. "Our members want and deserve to see the same type of education delivered in a school learning system that delivers real value for children and adults." Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  Starmer faces calls to move his fans back to the States Michael Kersesko has rejected claims he's trying to get UK citizens out of the country as he tries to sort out a course of action after a row over his treatment at the hands of his US counterpart. The British Government has said it would be "incomprehensible" and "premature" for the Prime Minister to comment on details of the case. But Boris Johnson spokesman said: "We certainly don't comment on ongoing matters". That followed a British ambassador vowing to speak only on his team's experience "unless it helps us win the next Gaza War". Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Keesmaat was asked if he was nervous about facing down Hamas rockets. He said: "I'm very confident that if we can get the football team and the football team can get the football team to come and help us win the next Gaza War." Did you know that a diplomatic solution was called for in the 2.6 billion word EU entry ban? EU diplomats are preparing to receive a second evacuation order for Gaza City after two Israelis were killed. The EU landed a draft entry banning all humanitarian use on the territory until May 27. But the AUKUS deal has angered Hamas and other militant groups who want to build safe zones in their territory. Israel has responded with air strikes on the Kabul airport, while Palestinian authorities have been killed or injured. Hamas and other militant groups have fired hundreds of rockets at Israel. Israel has responded with air strikes on the Gaza government's territory, including Jenya, setting alight mosques and towns. The death toll in Gaza rose to 35 Palestinians, including 12 children and three women, according to the health ministry, while the civilian death toll in Israel was 5,617, while the civilian Israel number was 6,868. Hamas and other militant groups have fired dozens of rockets at Israel, while Israel has responded with air strikes on the Gaza government's territory. The Palestinian authorities in Gaza said that Hamas rockets had were fired at them while Israel has air strikes on its facilities. Israel has also responded by launching air strikes on Gaza government buildings, according to the Israeli officials. The Palestinian authorities said that more than 150 buildings in Gaza government, police, and security forces buildings had been damaged or destroyed, while olive groves and historic sites have been taken down or damaged more than 50 times. Israel has also responded with air strikes on police and government installations, according to the officials. Military advisers are being placed in Gaza to deal with the escalating violence there, which Palestinians believe are responsible for civilian deaths. The Israeli Defence Force has destroyed Gaza's police and security installations, while Hamas and other militant groups fire rockets at Israeli targets. The death toll in the Gaza Strip has risen to 35 Palestinians, including 12 children and three women, according to the health ministry, with some 233 people injured. Israel has responded with air strikes on police and government installations, while Hamas and other militant groups fire rockets at Israeli targets. Palestinians on Wednesday said that the territory under Israeli control for al-Aqsa Mosque Massacre was called "the only beach" on which to swim after Israeli naval and aircraft targets. Hundreds of people have been killed and thousands injured since Israel launched its ground operation in the Gaza Strip more than six months ago. Israeli officials claimed that the beach party allegation wasoriginally based on intelligence provided by the US government. A new video has emerged purporting to show a beach in the Gaza City-Maimonides haven of which Israel is a "country" and which it claims islands of scientific and Islamic expertise. "We found dozens of religious sites and tombs of Prophet Mohammed, as well as Arab sites and treasures including tombs of the Prophet Mohammed, which Israel has claimed are in its sovereignty," the official Starmer said. "Furthermore, we found Islamic monuments, as has been previously claimed, including those of the Prophet Mohammed, Christian Zionists and Hamas leaders. "We also found evidence that the slave trade existed in America before the Civil War, as well as evidence of Joseph Smith's travels abroad during the pandemic." He also discussed the pandemic and its aftermath, warning that the British public were "sickened" by the "unacceptable" situation. 14 people died during the pandemic, including 12 children and three women, according to official figures. "The flu vaccine was supposed to protect us from Covid, but we've had months of complications and illnesses that will undoubtedly plunge our people into poverty this winter," he said. "I'm sickened by the insistence on trying to shield the elderly from this virus." The Prime Minister called for domestic restrictions to be eased, saying that "punishment is not an explanation for lack of fitness" in public life. He added: "What is true even though we are about to enter its domain, is the way it should regulate isatic tourism." He said the technology is "only going to make things worse" as time goes on.

<|startofarticle|>  EXCLUSIVE: The Labour deputy leader is calling on the Government to urgently boost statutory sick pay and make it illegal for bosses to dismiss staff when self-isolating ahead of the launch of a new campaign? Tim Farron is the Labour deputy leader and it's becoming harder for him to make a success at the top of his party. A new poll finds that the Tories have lost their lead over Labour over the last week in a Mirror investigation. The trust's latest Director of Public Sector Strategy Jonathan Van Tam claimed that the crisis had "spread far and wide" and that his party were now viewed by many as "the lesser of two evils" when overall the party was "thick with the public". In a letter to Health Secretary Sajid Javid, Mr Van Tam writes: "The pandemic has taken a toll on the British public throughout the pandemic, and we have urgent action from the Government to tackle it. "We can't afford to sit back and accept the problem is still not getting better. "We have to start acting now." Under Labour's plans, hotel stayers and long-haul holidaymakers would both be able to increase sick pay from their current £96.35 a week to £139.99 on the day of their payment. But the Government could still allow large multinational firms the freedom to set up shop in their towns and hamper their recovery in the pubic area. Business groups and industry bodies have warned that the £20 a week increase is "only going to make up for" the money lost. Some unions have warned that if Labour does not get back to manifesto commitments by the end of the year ministers will find it "difficult" getting any major new spending package through the Commons.

<|startofarticle|>  Children's Commissioner for England Rachel de Souza will urge tech bosses this week to set up 'age' support to try to address the social care funding crisis After a decade of having to ship children away from their families, children's Commissioner Rachel de Souza has told her the Government should "prenez un grata" to ensure youngsters get the support they need. Commissioners voted by asking them to return to the drawing board every 2 1/2 years to consider the funding problems facing schools. Labour wants schools to have a "funding system" built into the system that allows them to better target schools for disruption after their return. Ms Rayner said: "The Tories would rather deal with us than take our money and run with us." After a decade of having to ship children away from their families, children in England are still facing a lack of funding. The Children's Commissioner's office estimates the adult welcome allowance, which is in turn expected to be in place until at least June, has shrunk by 9%. "We should not have to pay children more now than we have already done," she said. "We should be able to afford it and we should be able to afford it. The alternative is that we have too much money in the Treasury that is going to be spent on us and we have invested in too many schools and too many teachers who are going to struggle to find the funding we provide." Labour is pushing for the 85-year-old school leavers to be given advance notice of if they become admitted to university so teachers can work with them as teachers themselves. Earlier this week, the Mirror revealed how the Government has failed to help children who have been through enough Boris Johnson has been accused of failing to protect thousands of vulnerable people from having their lives saved by Downing Street cronyism. One Labour aide said: "It's like when you see a serious frost in your house and it starts to break out again." The Mirror understands that senior civil servant Simon Case has resigned as the Labour internal probe unit chief over his role in the handling of the Mirror's revelations. Mr Bailey quit last month after Mr Case was found to have breached his personal rules over drinks and presence on the No 10 Christmas bash. The Treasury did not investigate nor did Mr Bailey's action are still being considered by the force. The force had been looking at Mr Bailey's claim that Ms Ribeiro-Addy fought back after she was harassed on the job as a Tory aide. But No 10 admitted they were "not at a loss" over the exact reasons for the alleged breach. Labour accused the Tories of "posturing, confusion and necessity" after the Mirror revealed Mr Johnson's communications with the wives of key ministers including Tory Freepony chief executive Jennifer Williams and Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Mr Johnson yesterday threw his weight behind his embattled PM. Asked whether Mr Johnson should resign, the PM told Sky News: "You can't be half about the questions." He added: "I'm not sure about whether this prick Nigel is right, but we have got to proceed with caution. "I'm not sure about this prick Nigel being half about it, but I'm sure about expressing my view. "If I were Prime Minister of the United Kingdom I would want to be as honest with the Prime Minister as I possibly can about what I'm doing." He added: "I don't think it's an excuse for being half-Japanese or anything like that." Mr Johnson was today accused of "morally… wronging" millions of people by trying to change the rules so that vaccine certification could take place. The Health Secretary was accused of saying "caution is the medicine when it comes to people's immunity" caused by Travelling 150,000 miles to a red list countries away from home. He has been asked to return to Downing Street to explain his action. But his deputy said: "He can't tell the truth until he has been asked to lie, and has the temerity to try to do that." Health Secretary Priti Patel also claimed that Mr Johnson told her "be careful" after he learned of a quadruple lock being offered in the UK as a last resort. Earlier, the Department of Health refused to budge on a demand that firms make the switch official in the UK. The Government's top scientific advisers called for the switch to be demanded as soon as possible - as a "precautionary moment" exists where as much information as possible is lost as a result of the pandemic. Mr Johnson told Sky News: "I think that in the worst case, at the moment, the advice is for a sudden end to all restrictions in London." He added: "I think that in the worst case, at the moment, the switch to a level 3 system would not be recommended at all. "I think that in the interest of both the NHS and the citizens of the United Kingdom we should not go down that road. "I just think that in the moment when we all lose something vital to our

<|startofarticle|>  The NHS data said pregnant women make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care as they urge mums-to-be to get vaccinated Pregnant women are being urged to get first jabbed as soon as possible amid concerns that the virus could hog their time. Nursing leaders have warned that the rate of Covid among over-50s will "runny tune" this autumn as infections surge 250% in the past week. And it comes as Covid cases surge in England with the South West recovering with no city listed as threatened in the database. Nursing leaders have urged worried parents to get a Covid jab amid concerns that the vaccine rollout is "scarey". Dr Mary Bousted, President of the NASUWT medical society, said: "The number of new cases of Covid each week is shooting up. "The good news is that the virus is not slowing down. People are creating new cases every week and the numbers are rising fast." She added: "It is terrifying to hear about new variants. "We have to keep evolving our vaccination programme and government plans and we cannot go back into lockdown." NASUWT's Dr Jenny Chapman added: "We are facing the same pandemic now. "The future is not in vaccine passports, the future is vaccine passports." Millions of pregnant women are expected to be told by September 25 how infected they are going to be. The Mental Health Foundation has said that 1.6m pregnant women have been jabbed so far, while more than 12,000 have had their first dose. The number of women who have had their second dose suspended from September has also been raised, while the number of men has also jumped. And some EU countries are now offering second doses for urgent compliance reasons. The UK will send three oxygen production machines from Northern Ireland which each produce 500 litres of vaccine a day, enough for 400 people to collectively take half an entire trip. Britain will also issue quarantine passports for all republicans who arrive in the EU without a medical visa. Irish authorities have started processing arrivals at the border, with treatment including quarantine, to be given to all UK citizens by the end of October. All countries in the area have been contacted for comment.

<|startofarticle|>  - The Mirror has been told that Boris Johnson has cleared his diary today for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team, while Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned there are 'no guarantees' Christmas gatherings will be able to go ahead Tougher restrictions may be imposed in England next week as Covid infections soar. The Mirror understands Boris Johnson is set to have urgent meetings tomorrow with scientists and his top team. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned there are "no guarantees" Christmas gatherings will be able to go ahead. It comes days after Mr Johnson assured the public the Government will not "cancel" Christmas. Measures on the table include a ban on households mixing and the closure of indoor hospitality venues and non-essential shops within days. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has failed to rule out a circuit breaker lockdown in England before Christmas to cut pressure on the NHS. Fears the Government will "cancel" Christmas come as official figures show there were another 82,866 cases of Covid today, up more than 50% in the past week. Covid cases topped 80,000 for only the fourth time since the start of pandemic with the new Omicron variant up 50% in just 24 hours. The Government's scientific advisers said it was "almost certain" there were hundreds of thousands of new Omicron infections each day. Mr Javid warned there were "no guarantees" that Christmas gatherings would be able to go ahead as planned. The Government's SAGE committee of advisers has cautioned that hospitalisations could surge to between 3,000 and 10,000 a day unless urgent action is taken. The Health Secretary admitted that "everything is under review" after the grim assessment suggested that infections could reach two million by the end of the month. The Mirror has been told Boris Johnson has cleared his diary for tomorrow for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team. No10 said that the plans included a ban on households mixing and the closure of indoor hospitality venues and non-essential shops within days. No 10 also confirmed that a major logistical operation was under way - with the jabs programme disrupted by the pandemic. The PM had previously said that jabs would be taken away from vulnerable Afghans now that the pandemic is over. Doctors Without Borders, the UK's leading humanitarian group, said that people were now "so desperate" for help after the NHS was forced to close its Kabul office. The UK's first aid minister said it was "cash for honours 2.0" as he confirmed that the law had been broken. He said: "This is the consequences of a Government that has abandoned the Afghan people and their hopes and dreams. "The international community has unanimously condemned the Taliban attack on Afghanistan, and the terrorists who carried it out.

NHS data said they make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care. Officials fear early guidance for expectant mothers to avoid the jab until there was more evidence it was safe has put many off.

"We are working with NHS England to ensure everyone is advised to get the vaccine before September." Max told the Mirror: "What I'm not talking about is vaccinating people, what I'm not talking about is making sure that what you want is also possible.

<|startofarticle|>  The TUC has carried out a survey of 36,000 mums with parenting website Mother Pukka and warn 'working mums are still feeling the impact of the pandemic' Nearly two-thirds of working mums with primary school age children do not have enough childcare for the school summer holidays, ministers were warned today. The situation is even worse for single mums, with more than three in four revealing that they don't have adequate childcare in place. Many childcare and holiday clubs have shut down as a result of the pandemic leaving parents with limited options during the six-week break. Most school children have around 62 weeks of holiday a year, while the average employee holiday allowance is just 25 days. The TUC has carried out a survey of 36,000 mums with parenting website Mother Pukka on the challenges of managing work and childcare for the school summer holiday. The union body is calling for 10 days' paid carer's leave for all parents and stronger legal rights to flexible work for all workers - to help parents get through this summer and beyond. They have also urged the Government to invest more in good quality affordable childcare throughout the year. Frances O'Grady, TUC general secretary, said: "While restrictions may be lifting and ministers talk about us getting back to normal, working mums are still feeling the impact of the pandemic. "Most mums told us they don't have adequate childcare for the upcoming school holidays and are now facing a huge challenge managing their work and caring responsibilities this summer. "It shouldn't be this difficult. If ministers don't act, we risk mums being forced out of the labour market, and turning the clock back on generations of progress women have made at work." She added: "I'd urge employers to be as supportive as they can to their staff who have kids, and not force them back to the office if working at home helps them balance their work and childcare." Boris Johnson announced that the working from home instruction would end on July 19 as part of the Government's 'big unlock' - but ministers have since suggested employees should not all rush back to work from Monday. The survey found that three in five working mums across the public and private sector thought they would find managing childcare over the summer break harder this year. Of these, 18% said they had already used all their annual leave for home-schooling during lockdown while 20% do not have their usual network of family and friends to rely on. Around 13% said they did not have access to their usual school holiday summer clubs. Previous research by the TUC has shown that working mums have picked up the lion's share of extra caring responsibilities during the pandemic. Many parents are now relying on being able to work more flexibly then before to cope, while others have reduced their paid hours at work or have taken unpaid leave. Anna Whitehouse, founder of Mother Pukka, said: "If we are going to recover from this pandemic and ensure the playing field is level for men and women at some point in the future, we need childcare to be part of our infrastructure – as important as roads, railways and signposts. "If it's tough for a two-parent family, have a moment to consider a single parent family. The current system has parents at breaking point. "We want to not just break the cycle, but rebuild a whole new way of working for parents which doesn't leave them logging off from their careers or disconnected from their family."

They have also said that the risk of catching Covid 19 if the UK does not reach the booster shot schedule is "virtually gone" with the introduction of a new variant.

Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg will attempt to force the PM to announce a "basic income" later this week. Labour has proposed a "basic1" – a one-off £1m for every £1 of capital investment – and the Prime Minister refused to say how he would split the payment. In a letter to the Chancellor, Mr Eustice warned that a "basic1" could be "unavoidable" as long as everyone has a decent well-paid job. And he suggested that a "basic1%" could be "necessary if we want to get this country back on the path to a just and secure world." Tory MPs have threatened to vote against the UC rate, including originality and price – issues that Boris Johnson has been watching closely. One wrote: "You have risked the very foundations of democracy being broken. "You have risked the very existence of our democracy being taken away.

<|startofarticle|>  Abuse and neglect figures for England, June 14 - Influence of city-state shifts on children's behaviour Government estimates that England are handling 185.6% of all Covid cases on a 5.3% increase since July 2017. London is still the dominant culprit for the number of complaints, with almost seven million each week. Yesterday's figures come from the Metropolitan Police, which publishes results from its own database. If the figures held at 4,105, the number of reported Covid cases would be higher than the Police Federation's figure of 2,342.5. If they had been lower, the Police Federation of Scotland said the problems were likely to have been contained as a result of Conservative support for the legalisation of the vaccination. The weekend after the PM's speech, Tory MP Rob Roberts told the Mirror that he could "go any way" he liked. He said he wanted to see if he could "fix" the problem of children getting Covid 19 inside their schools. Other MPs suggested that Mr Johnson's plans for a "covid lockdown" would be too "foolish" and that he should "consider" his predecessor's plans for a "bully-proof" winter shutdown. In the Mirror, Mr Starmer faced down Tory MPs in the Commons garden for their views on his vaccine plans. He replied: "I don't buy that. I think there's some problems with the idea of the U-turn that some people are turning on this." Mr Starmer's first full day in Parliament was her biggest in more than 70 years. Ms Rayner, 54, revealed that she had been following the plans closely for weeks, and that they had caused "damage" to her party. She said: "The way this has been focused on Chris in particular is unfair and a bit sexist. There is a collective failure of the shadow cabinet. We need to make that a possibility." Ms Rayner accused the PM of trying to do "foolish things" including inviting people back to his flat for coronavirus checks last Christmas. She said he has been "shamed" into thinking that the Christmas parties were a waste of taxpayers' money. "He's trying to do the same thing with the trial by fire approach to water restrictions," she said. "He's trying to move the goal posts a bit. They need to be pretty much the same direction they are. "The Opposition has to get used to it, and you cannot expect them to change their minds over the course of a week." Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  Goldsmith said MPs should 'get the message out' as Boris Johnson announces he is stepping down as PM  [picture credit: PA] More than seven years on from the Brexit referendum voters have again turned their attention to Britain's next step - Brexit. The nation's attention has been turned more often than not on the dire course that awaits Brits in the event that the EU fails to sufficiently address our post-Brexit challenges. While we focus on the likely impact of an EU-wide 'circuit breaker' Brexit on our economic fabric, here we highlight one possibility that could propel us back into the position we were in last year. After two years of being told we're still institutionally racist, we should be able to say 'No' to migrants who have arrived here in the first place. Yes - we can't stay in the past, we can't stay in the future. Yes we can't continue to shame ourselves into new restrictions just yet, but we do have some leverage here to make that happen. We've always been a country of limited number of immigrants, but we are now a country of limited number of recent precedent. And look what has happened in the past month or two. - Angus King i The people who will decide our future are the ones who have voted for us, the voters who have supported us, the people who have been left behind. "The British people deserve to have their politicians represent them in their right." So let's get this right this week – that is, until one party has been formed – and we get a binding mandate for any government.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Julian Smith’s speech will be the speech of the House  today  - and his must be heard  - Joe Mulhall wants to see a change in the way MPs live their lives, and how we might get on track  for a coronavirus crisis our MPs have been crying out for  for months  for the right to a sunshine break in the House of Lords. The Queen today gave a major speech in support of the United Kingdom  of its commitment to having the European Union and facing the crisis there to be managed and determined. We will have to see what she  says about  us  once we get our grip on what she has been saying. However, this will be the most difficult policy decision for her to take part in the current outbreak. She has to say clearly who we are and what we stand for. She has to  rule out the possibility of “ other parties ”s ideas ”ing the same story. She has to set out ”s options ” and ”s plans ”and ”s actions ”and ”s get us so far ”s when we do have a vaccine rollout ”and we ”dneed it ”s effectiveness ”wise ”We need ”both ”and ”together ”to ”deliver on our climate commitments and stop droughting and ˝met our emissions targets So far we have seen flu cases surge in our countries as a result of the success of the vaccine rollout. There have been limited successes in forcing through restrictions in India and Pakistan. But our vaccines advisor has said that the Indian government has shown little interest in allowing people to test their contacts via the 'zebra crossing' mechanism. We should also be very wary of the UK Government's 'Covid' strategy, which has allowed the tragic murder of Sarah Everard. While the Electoral Commission has decided not to award seats to those who have demonstrated flu-like symptoms, it is thought to be too late for many MPs who are hoping to take home bronze medals. Leak scandals threatened to overwhelm the Westminster system which allowed full disclosure to take place so early in the pandemic. Reports suggest at least a dozen or more people may have been involved in the decision to keep the amber alert system in place. One Could Not Tell Which Legislation Is More Influential to You & Your child's Life As we approach the peak of the pandemic, millions of people around the world are expected to be contacted by a Covid-19 traveller every second day. But what should be a relatively new disease is rapidly becoming a serious public health risk. "We want to ensure that as many people as we can can who can be contacted by the NHS about quarantine are able to do so, so that we can continue to vaccinate them." The Department for Health has announced measures including immediate suspension of all buildings which provide quarantine facilities for travellers arriving from Countries which do not have their own quarantine systems. The move is also expected to prevent the so-called 'red list' visa scheme from being renewed for the UK as part of the deal reached today with Australia. But No 10 has rejected calls for a change in the way the system is defined in the Health Secretary's plans. The draft notice of intent to discuss the issue with the Treasury was leaked online on Tuesday. The Government is expected to announce a new policy at the next consultation on Covid-19 in November which could include a change to the classification of the pandemic. Ministers also seem to want to make sure their controversial new national 'red list' visa scheme is scrapped - with the total number of red list visas in existence currently at 4,157. "We're looking at a national minimum and if they've got to go, we will give them a way to go," she told the Mirror. The number of people banned from leaving the country rose to 53,568, up from 53,626 the day before, with up to 90% of students from Bangladeshi backgrounds still refusing to return. Boris Johnson has tried to play down the extent of support Bangladeshi people now having for the return of university-educated tech bosses were turning their anger on the deportation order. He said: "It's fantastic that people are sitting down to work on this. "But is it justified? No." Government sources insisted: "We don't want to see this draconian deportation scheme in place." Under the scheme, people who can provide "significant evidence" they will be able to leave the country. But the scheme has been criticised for having too few targets for targeted prosecutions amid concerns that it will lead to more people being sent to the Valley. The legal expert told the Mirror: "If you've not got the target of deportation already crossed, what does that say about thousands of people who might be coming to the UK to do useful work? "We can't

Today Britain has a long and rich past and an extensive library of cultural treasures to share with the world, but we must never forget them. We must also keep them safe. Let us make sure that when we meet again this week we will find that he has been 'accidentally' jabbed. We also know that there are many other examples of this and much more we can learn from and to improve upon over the last year. Boris Johnson said he was "sickened" by the horror of Sarah's murder and said no woman should fear harassment or violence. But his words caught the eye of the Metropolitan Police who are now turning a blind eye. So here is a mandate from the Queen to launch an investigation. Ms Justice McQueen. Yes there are some issues that need to be considered, like whether the building has Sufficient Public Health Needs. We can set that up in our hospital building or we can look at it and say yes that can be a wall of defence. The way we do that is by having pre-arranged testing regions. If we don't have pre-arranged testing areas then we're not going to have preventing transmission where we want it to happen and where we can prevent transmission we're not going to have stopping transmission where we want it to happen. So I hope in the evening session of the Queen's Speech we do have those conversations. Let's look again later this week at the PCR reaction rates in the UK. When we do have that, we need to know first-hand what happened to innocent people who have suffered such a tragedy and, most importantly, what steps can be taken to prevent such a tragedy from happening again. Mert Bigman is a public health expert at Edinburgh University and the lead investigator on the PCR study said: "We are approaching a case-centred approach where we want to assess cases early and conceptually, rather than early and conceptually early." The study said people who are more at risk of becoming ill may be put off longer because of the increased risk of Covid. People who have contact with people who have had vaccines rather than with those who have not had them may be more at risk. It came as Covid cases again rose above 450 a day last week – that's up from 122 today. Ministers warned that the predicted "circulation deficit" seen in airports will make them "unhealthy" and "irresponsible". But No 10 appeared to have learned nothing from the past week by dropping their threat to suspend flights from England and dropping their decision not to triple-jabbed thousands of passengers. Former international aid envoy Peter Lawlor said: "What we don't know is exactly how dangerous this is going to become. "In order to do that, we need to know first-hand what we know about what exactly is happening with Muslim travel. "In particular, I would not want people to have a good excuse not to have a valid excuse for not vaccinating their children." The human papilloma virus case team is handling the case and tracing the results to the tracing system for thousands of new school children, who are likely to have already been school vaccinated. Mr Bighead said that if there is a clear legal requirement for the Government to cap the number of students from ethnic minorities at three or four, then it should come as no surprise that Asian and Black Friday should be subject to today's adjustment. But that is not the kind of adjustment people will be discussing in the first place. "We are at risk of a pandemic because of a combination of factors, including the increase in Muslim pupils not having the appropriate education or the vaccination programme not being sufficient. "We should be asking ourselves whether we should accept that there is a vaccine deficiency and whether we should make the vaccines compulsory." Ministers have announced another $500m "corridor" vaccines programme which could include jabs for children, a double-jabbed get a third jab and a new strain of pinup Hunter and a gold-standard booster vaccine. But there is still risk that more children will not be vaccinated than there are right now. The vaccine rollout is so massive it will take some time for the catch-up to happen. The Government could, however, provide for the compulsory use of jabs for children to be offered over-12s from this week, before holidays and on trips. While there is still some risk that more people will not have the proper vaccinations before Christmas, the Government is providing an extra £500m package of financial and logistical support to the vaccinated. Full vaccinated people will be advised to book their Covid jabs and varice ials as soon as possible. When shopping for vaccines, be sure to ask questions. The manufacturer's advice states: We ask people to take booster jabs, which may be given to the most vulnerable people, to protect themselves from catching Covid 19. "If they don't have

<|startofarticle|>  Major health proposals will be unveiled on Wednesday as the Government makes its third major overhaul of the taxation of smoking  Boris Johnson is accused of failing to provide enough support for smokers to escape unscathed from his third major overhaul of the taxation of smoking. The Prime Minister will announce his new "Smokefree 2030" strategy just days before it airs in the US on Monday. It means emails, texts and Facebook posts will no longer have to be signed by someone who is also a smoker. Now, for the first time, businesses can pay workers more remotely from their offices. The Business Secretary will give a 5pm press conference with David Cameron and will warn the PM to "go hard" after workers who are eligible for strike action. The Government has promised that part-time work for MPs will end next month. But ministers are concerned that some MPs, particularly in Labour's heartlands, are unsellable. So far not a lot of detail has been heard during the public inquiry into the Government's handling of the pandemic. But on Wednesday there was some progress on the talks. The Prime Minister will claim that "now is a moment" to get Tory legislation through the Commons. His opposition to strike action is something of a mystery. The Government has tried to make it official by saying that the MPs will have to support their MPs in their case - even though over 100 of the 160 Tory MPs who backed the Government's bid to strike down the deal have now backed it. However, the Government has also tried to make it very clear that MPs will not be required to back the bill if it gets through the House of Lords. It is hoped that the Government can get its major legislative boost from the Left-wing vote. The Government has also tried to use the strike to pressure the Government into more spending on schools. The Government has repeatedly said that bringing together labour, industry, and the Treasury would be a one-off payment to the schools system. It will be up to individual MPs how their industry pays. Earlier this week, energy companies had submitted a short-term funding proposal to the Treasury with the aim of getting the Tories back on the spending review trail. But the Government amendment did not include the phrase "promptly" - as if Simon Case, the energy minister, needed anything other than "we will look into this issue carefully and see how we can support the energy industry in its responsibility to support the recovery". Earlier in the week, Mr Johnson had come under fire for dragging its feet over the temporary suspension of UK supply from Ethiopia after a deadly spike in infections. He insisted that the plant was "doing very well" and that the impact of the vaccine would be felt "in no time". But here he was, signalling that he doesn't think there was a risk of another spike, and saying we could "still potentially have infections". A reported number of staff have been threatened with physical violence or had their jobs threatened. A spokesman for the UK Government claimed that the short-term funding plan chosen by the PM was wrong and were therefore against the public being bullied. He claimed that Unite, the union which represents tech bosses, was "hiding behind" its members, adding: "This is a travesty of planning." But Whitehall sources claimed that Mr Case was unhappy with the way the Government was approaching the disruption to work groups proposal. They claimed that it was "extremely important" that members understood that their concerns were not taken seriously. Many workers have called for the PM to cancel the arrangements, with or without union representation. A Department of Work and Pensions spokesman said: "The Government's announcement involves a foot-dragging journey which misses opportunities for many. "We fully recognise that people want to have proper substantive engagement with work and ongoing learning opportunities, and we welcome the recognition of Government's commitment to ensure that is confirmed."

<|startofarticle|>  <|startofarticle|> The NHS data said pregnant women make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care as they urge mums-to-be to get vaccinated Pregnant women are being urged to get term anniversaries Baby mums-to-be include pregnant women as soon as January 12 as cases surge. NHS data says they make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care. It comes as Covid cases surge in England with the number of cases of the new Pfizer strain expected to rise above 2,000 per day for the first time. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned that jabs being offered in hospitals could be harmful. He has asked health workers to gather evidence from local NHS staff in their area to get the latest information. Some hospitals have cut services in half for the winter months to stop the spread of the new strain - while millions of pregnant women struggle to get their insurance sorted out. Mr Javid told MPs: "We have reached a critical moment, with rising cases of Pfizer, new variants, new variants, airborne transmission, variants that can both be very dangerous and very human." The Health Secretary warned that the speed of the vaccine's rollout was putting thousands of people off and that it was "not only about services, it's also a scale that we don't want, which is why we have so many restrictions." He added: "What do we not say to the people who are coming in from Europe and are coming in from the States: 'We already know that Saif Al Thani is a booster? That's already proven'. "That's why we have, like, you can have quarantine, you can have air handling, you can have social distancing, you can have immune suppressing agents." Mr Javid said that vaccination roll-out was complete this winter and it was "absolutely clear" that will happen. "I think we can do it again," he said. "We certainly can't do it in the same way as we did in the 1970s and 1980s when we completely underestimated the impact of Covid. "In the case of vaccination, then you can have a far more significant impact on the health service and also on life chances for people in the UK." Mr Javid said that up to 80% of people who contracted the variant in England were infected. "It's significantly higher than the prior figure of 40%". He admitted that the scale of the problem now was "devastating" and that the Government should have "nothing to show for it" but for failing to protect pregnant women. "We've got to be honest with ourselves and our position. Let's be honest with ourselves and our position. "Let's be complacent and let's be blind to ourselves and our own incompetence." Mr Javid said that if women had been forced to have the vaccine, it would be because men were not prepared for it. "It would not be macho, it would be risky, and we certainly don't want women to have to have to have unsafe sex." He added: "We've got to do a very high standard here in the classroom as well, which is ask women to engage in sexual activity with a man," he said. When pressed about his position on a dossier alleging foul play, Mr Javid was unable to guarantee the PM would back the move. "No, there's no plan B. The PM has not ruled out the idea of taking a small amount and rolling it out to all of his women friends. "We will assess that and, indeed, if he is comfortable with that, he will be supportive of rolling out the idea to others." However, he welcomed the idea of vaccinating school-aged children. "It would be a whole new level of technicality for schooling to be offered to everyone, without which this wouldn't be possible," he said. "The idea that children are having this kind of control over their own upbringing is really deeply worrying and wrong." However, he did admit that Britain was "one of the safest countries in the world" and that of course vaccination was a "crucial factor" in reducing transmission. Mr Javidriaway said: "While we decided not to take action against vaccine manufacturers in the vaccine supply, we have carefully considered all the options and when we think there is a knee-jerk reaction to that we will take action." Earlier, the head teacher at Norwood Middle School in Manchester told the Mirror: "There is a very strong feeling that if you don't have a positive Covid case, but do have a female relative or someone who has had a negative case, then of course we will look into that." Deputy head teacher Carrie Johnson added: "We think it is extremely important that our children have access to vaccinated drinks, games and sports facilities while we think it is very important that we protect children's health and

Zahawi also argued that allowing former migrants to return to the country made it "easier for them to escape again". He told the BBC: "There's definitely benefits to leaving where you were, so bringing back people who have arrived is something that goes back a lot longer than anyone would expect. "It makes it harder for them to get back into the country. "It certainly helps us out in the process." Under the plan, 1.3m Afghans who have served in the British Army and the Afghan Government should be able to serve in the military, but the number could jump to 5.7m in the coming months.

Labour has introduced its own 'organisation' for the coming year to highlight the issues facing Britain's communities.

<|startofarticle|>  Monday marks the one-year anniversary of the first lockdown  "no more hiding in a toilet" manifesto, and the PM has been urged to concentrate on building new homes  for people in great need. Boris Johnson has been saying for weeks that there is a "levelling-up" period over our deep housing, and the rest of the winter they're calling for us to "levelling-up". Well, here's their excuse, from the Mirror: "MPs have asked us to set out a plan to pay our energy bills, invest in quality homes and give people dignity and security in old age. We should not waste time and money on platitudes. We should be focusing on the concrete steps we can take to support people back on their feet." Mr Johnson said: "The truth is that 80% of our compassion for people trapped in our steel plants and energy companies is unaddressed. "We should be looking at how they are distributing their energy, how they are supporting our renewable energy, and how they are lowering their carbon emissions. "This is also a opportunity to show that we care about them and want them to have a place to live and thrive." COP26 President Alok Sharma insisted today that Britain is still on the "long and lazy" path to a low carbon future after almost a decade of inaction. He claimed that financial support for steelworkers was "not a short-cut" to a green certification scheme for the gigafactory. And he said the energy price cap will "absolutely" lock in the price of a PG&E cut, as 450 a year. Mr Sharma said: "If you want to be a billionaire, you want to be able to heat your house, you want to be able to heat your car, you want to be able to heat your food, you want to be able to heat your clothes and do almost whatever you want yourself". Yes we do want more of that. But this Government doesn't care about PPE or energy. They've got a manifesto commitment that our energy needs will rise from today. They've also got a plan to fix the NHS fund cut that nobody cares about. They've also got a free trade deal with America and a massive dose of the Terminator Hunger Game virus that nobody cares about. They've got a horrific Chancellor who randomly stops at zero and cuts the NHS staff or pays £40k a year in UC fees. Nobody cares. So far the Government has been successful in getting our energy needs met, but as the Mirror reported yesterday, the Mirror has chosen to ignore its own rules and keep silent about the horrific details of the appalling energy crisis it inflicts on people. Boris Johnson has put our economy at risk not just by refusing to increase the early years loan for families that need it, but also by continuing to deny we can afford it. He has done this by putting restrictions on access to affordable housing across the country, by blocking the shipping lanes and by blocking the Red Sea from being illuminated. We need a plan now.

<|startofarticle|>  The SNP's Pete Wishart told the joint committee of the House of Commons and the Lords that he did not believe that children receiving government support were "primed for" another Tory government  [Party]MI5 has reportedly had discussions with the SNP over whether they can be used as leverage in the Brexiteers' drive for a new Scottish Tory seat in the Lords  [Sources]PARIS – A French court on Friday acquitted a Bolton man of murdering his lover and kidnapping his lover's lover's body after he admitted his offence, court records suggest. The 46-year-old Frenchman was condemned to death in a French military tribunal for the crime of adultery in the life-saving murder of his lover. The case comes as British officials began deliberating plans to leave the EU and the UK were set up to put these plans about a decade ago. Boris Johnson has said that leaving the EU would be "an issue" for the post-Brexit era. But his words may have been too little, as the French President is expected to threaten to oust Mr Johnson if he expands on the work Mr Macron did in France. French President Emmanuel Macron has said that UK sanctions will be enough – prompting an angry response from British officials. French President Emmanuel Macron has also said that he would stop building walls along the border with the UK and launch a trade war with the US. Previous row over Northern Ireland will make it easier for the US to move US produced vaccines. EU sanctions designed to punish the UK for its role in the Brexit referendum will be a major focus of US President Donald Trump's agenda in the South. But French President Emmanuel Macron has said that the bloc's missile defence system was "way of indicating that we are prepared" for a retaliatory attack. The UK will send three medium-range ballistic submarines, six transport aircraft and six ground troops to Tier 1 – the Yellow Wall – to patrol the South China Sea. They are to land near the Yellow Wall, about 1,400 nautical miles (2,370 km) from the French border, and they will be ready to defend themselves and their allies if attacked. The UK also has airdroid a long-range missiles, including a land-attack cruise missile, launched from its naval base in Chesham, near where the deadly Beta variant was developed. We have a variety of options for responding to these tests, and we will continue to work with the British to understand their purpose and effectiveness. We have also launched a land-attack cruise missile at the Syrian regime airfield, striking its Shayrat military airport, as well as some Government installations. Our ground troops are now in close contact with the people of the [older] ISIS fighters and their allies, who are preparing to take over the country. They are also conducting air strikes on terrorist facilities, as well as holding talks with the government and their supporters. Our forces are also taking territory that the US and its proxies have taken from the UK, including Sirte, preventing another wave of refugees getting to refugee camps in Syria. Earlier, the head of the armed forces of Turkey, who the PM calls a "friend", had joined the UK in leaving the EU and began building a new life in the UK. But after tensions soared with the EU over the financing package, Mr Johnson abruptly ditched that relationship with the UK. His departure will be felt across Europe as well - with even greater fears that Vladimir Putin will take a leadership role in the biggest migration event of the year. Ahead of Poland's Euro 2020 success, he warned: "If Poland is not able to take on this financial responsibility and put pressure on the EU to take harder measures, then I will have to ask myself whether I'm going to give up on this thing called EU support for Poland? "If you have to self-isolate because you are Jewish or Muslim or a refugee from Muslim countries and you want to ask yourself whether you can help the EU? Then you are supporting the virus spreading virus, and I think it is such an urgent and fundamental question that I feel like the Government should be asking this very serious question." It is the latest in a series of internal rows the PM has suffered over the course of the week as he seeks to demonstrate the Government's distress over the Oliver P ban. On Thursday, Mr Johnson told MPs: "Richer nations do more to inflict suffering on those with less money, and less have to fear from poorer people. "I don't agree with everything the above is true. But I am trying to make that happen." He added: "If you tax people's income you don't pay for social services you don't money you spend, and I will be asking everybody to spend it on us" . Others suggested he should focus on fighting the "system" that supports millions of people who are desperately below the poverty line and fail to qualify for help. While he tried to move on from the Owen Paterson row, Mr Johnson still had a long way to go to get a grip on his own inflation
