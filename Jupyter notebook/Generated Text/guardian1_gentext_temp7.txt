<|startofarticle|>   The health secretary has said the government may need to reintroduce mandatory face masks and advise the public to work from home, as he set out the government's plans for coping with Covid in England through the autumn and winter. Sajid Javid told the House of Commons: "Any responsible government must prepare for all eventualities," as he outlined what he called the government's "plan B" in the event that the virus surges.  He conceded that mask-wearing and vaccine passports for crowded venues could be introduced if necessary – as well as "communicating clearly and urgently to the public the need for caution". But he did not mention lockdowns, as he informed the MPs of what he called his "plan A" for managing the virus, "without the need for stringent economic and social restrictions". "We must be vigilant," he told MPs. More details of the government's contingency measures have been set out in a document published alongside Javid's statement, including plans for vaccine passports. The prime minister announced in July that it would be compulsory to prove vaccination status before entering nightclubs and other crowded venues. The government has since backed away from the plan after a backlash from Tory MPs, but Javid confirmed it was being held in reserve. The document says vaccine passports would be applied to all nightclubs; all indoor, crowded settings with 500 or more people such as music venues; all outdoor settings with 4,000 or more people such as festivals; and any venue with 10,000 or more people, such as big sports matches. It acknowledges the plans may need to be implemented at short notice – and encourages businesses to introduce vaccine passports voluntarily. The document also includes advice to the public about how they should behave as winter approaches. They are urged to meet outdoors where possible, keep windows open when meeting indoors, and think twice about activities such as singing or dancing. "In general, the risk of catching or passing on Covid-19 is higher in crowded spaces (where there are more people who might be infectious) and in enclosed indoor spaces (where there is limited fresh air)," the document says. "Some activities, such as singing, dancing and exercising can also increase the risk of transmission of Covid-19 as people are doing activities which generate more particles as they breathe. The risk is greatest where these factors overlap." The public are also cautioned to "wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed settings" – advice taken by very few of the Conservative MPs sitting behind Javid in a busy Commons chamber as he spoke. The government also pointedly refuses to rule out imposing a fresh lockdown. "While the government expects that, with strong engagement from the public and businesses, these contingency measures should be sufficient to reverse a resurgence in autumn or winter, the nature of the virus means it is not possible to give guarantees," the plan says. "The government remains committed to taking whatever action is necessary to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed but more harmful economic and social restrictions would only be considered as a last resort." Plan B would be invoked, the document says, "if the data suggests the NHS is likely to come under unsustainable pressure". Javid said 81% of people over 16 had received two doses of Covid vaccination, and the link between infections, hospitalisation and deaths had been "weakened significantly", so that deaths from the current wave had been "mercifully low". He said the government's plan A included five pillars: renewing efforts to maximise vaccine uptake and expanding it to 12- to 15-year-olds; maintaining the test-and-trace system, including encouraging regular asymptomatic testing; boosting funding for the NHS and social care; encouraging people to modify their behaviour, such as meeting outside; and cooperating with international partners. Javid also confirmed the government would publish a new framework for international travel before the end of this month. Earlier, the government's health advisers announced their recommendation that booster jabs be delivered to the over-50s and younger people with underlying health conditions that make them vulnerable to the virus. Javid confirmed he would take that advice. Children aged between 12 and 15 will also be offered one dose of the Pfizer vaccine, as recommended by the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, and his colleagues. Javid also said it was "highly likely", that vaccination would be made compulsory for frontline NHS workers.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Rutger Hoyer has said the European commission should be investigated and rebutted over data about the public's concerns about the government's recent travel restrictions. The travel advisory announced by the prime minister on Monday, – which recognises that many people are "unable to tell the difference" between good-quality, well-priced tickets and empty shelves in the shops – has sparked a backlash among Tory backbenchers concerned about the impact on civil liberties. Ministers have declined to comment on the case directly, but Boris Johnson's spokesperson has confirmed that the prime minister will attend a Cobra meeting on Tuesday, where the EU's summit meets February, according to a spokesperson for the prime minister.  Johnson's arrival in the role has sparked questions about his competence and whether he can hold the line against Brussels' attempts to weaken the benefits system. While he has been characterised by a quiet determination to improve people's lives, many Conservative MPs are scarred by the long period from 2010 when he was still in politics. When the health secretary, Matt Hancock, was being lobbied by the government's travel agency, Venmo, to take on a frontbench role, he declined. Boris Johnson has long been sceptical about the need for this kind of thing, and even before Wednesday's tragic events, few MPs believed he would take the difficult decision. Yet by ditching the electoral college, which is expected to dictate how decisions are made, the electoral college would make it harder for an opposition party to ally themselves with cronyists or other interests. By contrast, the plans would make it easier for the party to set out a candidate's agenda in a face-to-face meeting, and could also be used to develop a "pragmatic programme for the future of democracy", drawing on the discredited 2030 goals of "levelling up", "building back better" and "building back safer". "Build back better" is a catch-all for many of the 2030 pledges made by the Tories, who kept the public spat going over the promise of free universal credit. Yet by Wednesday, when Johnson and his chancellor, Rishi Sunak, were making the point well that the UK was "missing for choice", Tory MPs were claiming the prime minister had been partly to blame for the government's failings. The prime minister's personal brand of Conservatism has been replaced by a new-style ad hoc operation. The Covid press officer, Katy Clark, was replaced by Olivia Blake, a longtime party official who knows voters well by reminding them of the long-term vision the party set out in its 2019 manifesto. Other changes include a return to an electoral college, which would make it harder for a particular party to win a general election. Johnson's official spokesperson has insisted the party was never meant to be "locked on" to the existing political wrong-headedness that has made it difficult to move beyond "levelling up". "We were never meant to be 'levelling up'," he said. "We got ourselves into this position by: 1) trying to very deliberately avoid being politically unstable; and 2) trying to get ourselves into this position because we knew that if we behaved in a way that was going to inflame the situation, we would get into this situation again. We knew that we couldn't just rely on words; we knew that we couldn't just rely on convention. And so we knew that we had to change. And that meant we had to change in a different way in a different way about the way the world is doing," he said, comparing the pandemic to "an inverted pyramid of dependence". "We've got to change. And that means we've got to change radically about how we run our campaigns in the future." The Conservative manifesto promised to build a "green industrial revolution" that would make the use of green technologies more widely accessible. The technologies described as "greening" the NHS could help achieve that, by replacing "levelling up" with "new technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning". Johnson's official spokesperson has insisted the UK remained committed to the Paris accord. "We are. We're going to keep working with our international partners to make sure we're using the best technologies to help us meet our commitments made during the crisis – and that means making sure that our facilities are up and running, our energy bills are up and running, our workers are going through the right transformation." Climate Realities highlighted that the government had not yet put in place for itself the national insurance profile for the private sector, and meant many of the sectors included in the government's list did not appear to be fully worked up. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, was asked on Sky News earlier this week about the availability of unemployment benefits for millions of workers who had been trapped in insecure working relationships for many months. "There are availability issues. We will work with the department to find out how the department can make sure that people are not going to be in situations like this, where the nature
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Conservative backbencher Rachel Reeves will warn that ministers should not be spending "fiscal day" on trying to win re-election, as Starmer seeks to switch the focus from tackling the government over the pandemic, to bread-and-butter issues. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is due to announce the results of an overhaul of consumer prices on Wednesday, but it is unclear how much of the revenue from soft-tax day will be devoted to trying to win re-election. Elections in many western democracies are held every three months, and the target is to raise £6bn by the end of March.  Reeves, the shadow secretary to the Treasury, was sent a letter on Tuesday by the shadow home secretary, Sajid Javid, after he was accused of not doing enough to prevent the taxpayer from being asked to back Boris Johnson's social care plan. "Why on earth not do something about it?" she said, in the tone of the letter, as seen below: "The Conservative government has already been through quite a few times already and this cut hurts both those with larger-than-expected budgets and those with smaller-than-expected budgets. The £6bn target represents only a partial resolution of the picture." With the next general election due in 2024 or potentially sooner, Reeves could face a significant challenge to Labour in the coming months, given the party's focus on overhauling the electoral system. The policy set out in a letter sent to Starmer's office on Monday, as he prepared to fly back to London from New York, also included a requirement for British nationals to show they have been admitted to the UK as a "culturally distinctive minority". It is understood that the party's general secretary, David Evans, is concerned about the risk of inflation getting out of control if wages rise without improvements in technology. Reeves' concerns are partly about the tax-and-spend approach that Tory MPs have taken previously – cutting business rates in 2016-17, for example. The former shadow chancellor George Osborne suggested last week that instead of cutting business rates at once, the government could consider reforming the system to give firms more control over decision-making. The idea, which was adopted immediately after the budget, as business confidence has been damaged by the Covid crisis, as well as several others before it, appears to have been achieved because of the resilience of the public services we currently hold. Business rates, which were initially docked to 39 countries, are based on the property value of a firm's premises. Their effectiveness as a measure of trustworthiness has been questioned by many countries, including many with proven track records of resisting changes in tax rules. However, Reeves argues that the hurdles for developing countries to jumpstart their economies are much wider, allowing the UK to start the process of free-falling from grace. "The reason that many countries have stopped at this very simple step and haven't stopped at any other step at all is that the Earth is very nearly in the middle of a two-degree tilt, and the Earth is very nearly in the grip of a two-degree earthquake," she said. "And as we have seen with the exception of New Zealand, in most other corners of the globe, the grip of a two-degree earthquake is very much in the grip of the British people. It is very much not in the continental United States." By contrast, Reeves said that she and the UK's European neighbours were likely to wait until the autumn of next year to act on the "framework" they had inherited from their European neighbours. "What I would like to see is an international effort to sort it all out by the time of the next general election," she said. "We then want to move on to the next stage of things, and then you can have a government that is actually taking responsibility, that is taking action." She brushed off claims that some Conservative MPs, such as the former justice secretary John Redwood, were trying to "cancel" the awarding of contracts to defence contractors. "I don't think that's my role. I'm not even that interested in debating what taxpayers' money is going to do," he said. "We've already discussed the possibility of taking a step back and thinking about what we're going to do with it, but it's not yet time for us to think about cancelling things. We've already taken a step back and taken a very, very serious approach and we'll continue to act on it." Reeves said she was standing by the government as it launches a new strategy for the future of justice, including the reintroduction of the death penalty. "I think what the prime minister has said is that he believes in the transformative potential of the clemency that he's got," she said. "He believes in transformative justice that comes from justice being rewarded for their service in protecting the people they serve. That is what we believe in." The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, on Tuesday rejected the idea that the clem
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Boris Johnson has said "we truly did everything we could" to minimise loss of life from coronavirus, and insisted he takes "full responsibility" for the government's handling of the pandemic. But when an inquiry is eventually carried out into the past 12 torrid months, the prime minister will have to face a series of difficult questions about key decisions he made.  As news first began to trickle out of China, triggering the government's pandemic planning, the prime minister left the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to chair the first five meetings of the emergency Cobra committee about the virus. After carrying out a fraught reshuffle of his cabinet, Johnson decamped to the taxpayer-owned mansion of Chevening, and did not chair his first Covid Cobra meeting until 2 March, just before the first confirmed UK death from the virus. Comforted by advisers who compared the challenge to tackling seasonal flu, he tended to play down the seriousness of the pandemic in its early days, insisting it was "business as usual". Most memorably, he told a Downing Street briefing that he "shook hands with everybody" during a hospital visit in early March. With the support of scientific advisers, Johnson took the decision to lift border restrictions on 13 March last year after evidence emerged that the virus was already circulating in the UK, despite a strict quarantine regime for arrivals from Wuhan, in China. At the time, the harsher approach adopted early on by countries such as Singapore and New Zealand, involving flight bans and quarantine, were regarded as extreme by ministers. But many analysts now believe closing the borders was an important precaution that helped these countries and others fare much better. Johnson announced a full-blown lockdown on 23 March last year, with little idea at the time that it would remain in place until July, with many children kept out of the classroom until September. He had edged towards the shutdown via a series of intermediate steps, including banning mass public events and exhorting the public to avoid unnecessary social interaction and to work from home where possible. Only when modelling carried out by Prof Neil Ferguson at Imperial College London suggested there could be up to 500,000 deaths if the virus was not brought under control, and amid growing signs that the public were taking matters into their own hands, did Johnson order the public to stay at home. Some public health experts now believe an earlier shutdown could have saved many thousands of lives. When it emerged that his top adviser had flouted lockdown rules by driving 300-plus miles to Durham, with a day trip to a local town thrown in, Johnson stuck by him resolutely. He told the public at a Downing Street press conference that his aide had acted "responsibly and legally", in crisscrossing the country, ostensibly to seek childcare for his young son, and then to test his eyesight, at a time when the public were being urged to stay at home. His decision sparked an avalanche of angry emails to MPs and risked undermining public confidence in lockdown rules at a critical time. The former TalkTalk executive Dido Harding was brought in by Johnson and Matt Hancock to run the hugely costly test-and-trace system, which has relied heavily on private sector outsourcing and has not worked as effectively as hoped. Councils carrying out their own local contact-tracing operations have generally obtained better results than the call centres run by Serco and other providers, while management consultants have in some cases been paid £7,000 a day for their expertise in setting it up. Johnson and his chancellor, Rishi Sunak, have declined to fix holes in the social safety net – including the paucity of statutory sick pay – that have created a strong financial disincentive for many people to self-isolate. Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance gave the prime minister a briefing on 16 September setting out the dire risks of allowing the virus to run unchecked as cases increased into the autumn. Their colleagues on the Sage committee suggested a short "circuit-breaker" lockdown, perhaps over the October half-term. But Downing Street aides made clear at the time that Johnson considered it to be his role to weigh up scientific advice with other considerations, including the economic and social costs of a fresh lockdown. He therefore opted for a middle course, between the scientists' proposal and the demands of many in his party to resist fresh restrictions: a beefed-up system of "tiers", with tougher rules for the hardest-hit areas. In the event, as Whitty predicted when they were introduced, even the strictest, tier 3 rules did not do enough to restrain the virus, and a month-long lockdown was announced on 31 October. A month before Christmas, the government agreed a plan with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland administrations that would allow up to three households to mix for a fixed five days over the festive period. Johnson then stuck resolutely by the plan, even as cases surged in London and Kent. Matt Hancock alerted the House of Commons to concerns about a new variant of the virus on 14 December,
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Keir Starmer has appointed well-respected north-east of England MP Sharon Hodgson as his new parliamentary aide, as he seeks to smooth relations with Labour backbenchers after last weekend's fraught reshuffle. Hodgson, the MP for Washington and Sunderland West since 2010, replaces Carolyn Harris, who resigned earlier this week amid claims that she had stoked up tensions between Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner.  As Starmer's parliamentary private secretary, her job will be to liaise between backbenchers and the leader's office. Some MPs have complained in recent weeks that they felt neglected by Starmer's team. Hodgson will also bring understanding of the north-east, where Labour lost the Hartlepool byelection last week, and the Midlands are said to be concerned by the concerns of some backbenchers. The media minister, Helen Whatley, was handed the job of communications minister on Tuesday, her role since the Hartlepool byelection on Friday, which Labour lost, with the Lib Dems making up the other key Vote Leave figure.  Starmer's team had faced questions over whether he was under pressure to play fast and loose with the traditional mayoral rules to win over a bloc of MPs, many of whom were in the clear for the poll, and whether he was keen to avoid having to sign off on historic reforms that some believe will cause a sharp decline in the number of people claiming to be eligible for social security. Hodgson's intervention appears to contradict Labour's own recent warnings that the Conservatives are at a "breakpoint". The party was quietly surprised by the size of the swing against Labour in the polls on Thursday, and the shadow cabinet office are quietly testing the public about whether they can take the punchlines out of the Tories' sizzle fizz by making them feel heard. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, rejected reports on Wednesday that ministers had already been shown data suggesting the benefits of a Covid vaccine are almost as great in the UK as in Europe or in India – but he confirmed it was being developed. The new version of the app, which is expected to be ready in the next two weeks, will allow users to generate proof of vaccination and show scientists have correctly predicted the increase in the number of children in poverty. It is expected to show that families are saving for a more prosperous future, and that a third world country is succeeding in producing better-quality products. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been increasingly bullish on the prospects for the economy as the recovery takes hold. He said on Wednesday that the latest official data showed that the fourth wave of the Omicron variant had closed in on Saturday, bringing the UK's annual output to an unprecedented 36.6bn bpd. The official data was maintained by the government, so dstgLab data is not publicly available.  Other government sources have confirmed the presence of the HLA band around the home secretary, No 10, and has led to a flurry of claims about the availability of loans at a time when the Lib Dems were ahead in the polls. One official said the government was liaising with financial firms about the availability of commercial credit cards. The official close to Boris Johnson said: "There's a lot of cronyism here, and it's not always the case that the government is the lender of last resort, but the government is the lender of last resort when it comes to the use of credit. "We've got a wealth of information that we can use to really get a grip on the makeup of the housing market and to understand what consumers are saying about it, particularly in the wake of the budget, where we've seen a huge increase in the use of credit cards." The prime minister is expected to set out further details of how the social care cap will operate on Monday, with the economy growing, but the health secretary, Sajid Javid, has stressed the significant impact of the coronavirus pandemic on hospitalisations and deaths. "It's certainly going to be bigger than I thought, but the coronavirus pandemic has hit the health service hard and really damaged their ability to deliver on their mission of care," he told MPs. As he spoke on Capitol Hill, the prime minister was speaking in the wake of a slew of embarrassing leaks about the scale of the public's distancing worries. The Lib Dems have been able to paint themselves as the challengers to the Tory party – taking on the Tories through sheer will – while the Tories have been able to paint themselves as the defenders of the public health messaging they have been using to "unleash the public's confidence". The Lib Dems have been able to portray Johnson as a health and social care miser, who cannot be both somewhat generous with the welfare state and equally generous with the labour market. While the Tories have been able to portray the partnership between the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and Hancock as one great "wall" against which to cling to the "it" of being the health secretary who can't be both
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour has confirmed it will put up a candidate in the North Shropshire byelection – the seat about to be vacated by the disgraced former Conservative cabinet minister Owen Paterson. There had been suggestions that opposition parties could band together to support an "anti-sleaze" candidate, after Paterson stepped aside following a botched attempt by Boris Johnson to protect him from punishment for paid lobbying.  In a joint statement, the pro- and anti-corruption parties said they would put their own interests before the interests of the taxpayer – and made available a "searchlight" that would reveal "all the details". The documents, which were made public on Tuesday, show that the parties have agreed a candidate will stand in the byelection, which is due to run in September. While Johnson's team have repeatedly insisted they are "relaxed professionals" who have not been damaged by the Covid crisis, the government is under pressure from a series of high-profile cases. In the latest breach of collective responsibility opinion, the former TalkTalk executive Rachel Sandby was found to have breached Labour rules on paid lobbying, although the legislation covering her was the same as her role as the lobbying firm. Labour also announced that it would pay a total of £6m to settle a case brought by five former employees of the party's former executive director, Andy McDonald, who was found to have acted in accordance with collective responsibility. The government has announced that it will legislate in the coming weeks to make it harder to silence elected officials. The ultimate decision on whether to proceed will depend on whether Klarna's committee – which is expected to report within weeks – decides to "demur" her comments. The government has extended that deadline by a day, 36 hours, to three days for an independent expert panel to be convened. But the Electoral Commission has suggested that, because of the disruption caused by social distancing and the need to smuggle voters into crowded venues, "natural constituency turnout was not significantly different between the groups". It is understood that byelections are key to the government's plans for "levelling up" – and on Tuesday they were extended by another day to allow for the planned manufacture of diesel-based cars and other high-powered machines. The government is expected to make the changes as soon as this week, with the first stage of its roadmap expected to be published on Wednesday. Unlike the earlier stage, when maps were produced and deployedynamic analysis was carried out to measure whether any changes have been made. Much of the improvement in the current version of the system is derived in part from the leaner the local elections, which allow for more liberal casting of voters. With the snap general election expected to be held in March, Johnson sought to switch the focus from the campaign – and made clear he was aiming specifically at the Conservatives. The Cabinet Office is known to have been agitating for a week this year for a candidate, Sir Alex Allan, who has since left parliament.

<|startofarticle|>  Generations ago, when the Oxford English Dictionary was first published, the Oxford abbreviation was broadly regarded as a misnomer, so the House of Commons decided to use the abbreviation OBE to differentiate it from English.  But in a vote of two to one, the Lords had already gone into effect next Tuesday, and clerks were often seen removing customers from busy, empty lots from the face down. Citizens Advice, which is also calling for the public to be cautious, has warned that the OBE could become a misnomer if it is not made clear that the measures set out in the 2019 manifesto will actually apply to their area. The changes will come as a "big bang" natural gas tax rise, and as natural gas capacity in some areas has been priced out of the UK. The government has also announced that "a minimum of 25% of the proceeds from the tax will be allocated for helping to expand open spaces across the UK". The health secretary, Matt Hancock, rejected the idea on Friday, saying that the sky would not fall if funding for the NHS and social care had not been cut.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Conservative backbencher Lucy Powell has pulled together her own informal contacts in government to criticise the government's decision to lift almost all Covid restrictions on 19 July, Sky News reported. Members of the public voted overwhelmingly for Labour in the most recent ballot initiative to curb the spread of the virus last week.  Some Conservative MPs, however, were irked by the idea of a public inquiry, and had pored over documents about the decision in a bid to resolve it. Opposition sources said that was not the way out, with the prime minister's office contacting MPs with concerns about the plan. Asked whether they had blocked the plan, they said they would await the outcome of other potential cabinet questions. However, they said they would await the judgment of the independent commission, the Office for Budget Responsibility, which is expected to report before the summer. "We're not ruling anything out that the pause would be sufficient to get Covid fixed this week," they said. They added: "There are other issues to look at, and we will look at them closely after the meeting of the OBR's scope of responsibility." Rachel Reeves, the shadow cabinet minister, insisted on Wednesday that families with children under the age of two could still donate the tissue at the scene of a devastating incident, but said it was not yet time to "throw the baby out the chimney". When the childcare tsar, Rachel Reeves, came under pressure from Labour for announcing late-term abortions alongside face-to-face briefings, she insisted the government was taking steps to make them a "normal part of the family". But when asked about whether all legal adults could be trusted with face-to-face briefings, she said: "We are taking steps at a national and local level now, and we are taking them seriously." The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said on Sunday that the government was "taking steps at a national and local level" and would "take them further" if necessary.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  The government is investigating the use of "Covid status certificates" to help allow society to reopen, Boris Johnson has announced, as he set out a cautious, four-step unlocking plan for England that will see some sectors remain shuttered until June. "The end really is in sight; and a wretched year will give way to a spring and a summer that will be very different and incomparably better than the picture we see around us today," the prime minister told MPs on Monday as he announced the unlocking plan.  Ministers have repeatedly denied that they would consider the domestic use of so-called vaccine passports, fearing they pose risks of discrimination, as some groups are unable to receive the coronavirus jab. But as part of the government's roadmap out of England's national lockdown, a review will be carried out to assess whether certificates could allow restrictions to be lifted more safely. It is expected to report before June. In a nod to potential objections, Johnson said the review would be, "mindful of the many concerns surrounding exclusion, discrimination and privacy". The keenly awaited roadmap, which the government insists will be dependent on "data, not dates", lays out a four-step reopening process that will see the "stay at home" order remain in place for a further five weeks. With the prime minister keen to avoid having to order a fresh lockdown, he has opted for a gradual lifting of restrictions across England, which is likely to irk some Conservative MPs, who will be given a vote on the plan next month. Schools will reopen to all pupils on 8 March. The only other change at that point will be that two people from different households will be able to meet outside socially, instead of just for exercise. From 29 March, in the second part of step one, the "stay at home" order will lift so people can meet family members in a park or garden, and outdoor sports facilities will be allowed to reopen. In step two, from 12 April, hairdressers and non-essential shops will be allowed to reopen, as well as self-catering accommodation, public buildings such as libraries and museums, and outdoor hospitality such as pub gardens. From 17 May, in step three, most rules on outdoor social contact will be lifted, aside from a limit of 30 on the size of gatherings. Pubs and restaurants will be able to serve customers indoors. In step four, from 21 June, all limits on socialising should be lifted and the government hopes that businesses that were unable to reopen in summer 2020, such as nightclubs, will be able to reopen their doors. The five-week gap between the phases is intended to allow four weeks for data to emerge about the impact of the changes on the disease and a week's notice for the next stage of easing to be introduced. "The chief medical officer is clear that moving any faster would mean acting before we know the impact of each step, which would increase the risk of us having to reverse course and reimpose restrictions. I won't take that risk," the prime minister told the House of Commons. Johnson told MPs: "We're setting out on what I hope and believe is a one-way journey to freedom." He said there was "no credible route" to a zero-Covid Britain - or a zero-Covid world - and argued: "We cannot persist indefinitely with restrictions that debilitate our economy, our physical and mental wellbeing, and the life chances of our children." The factors the government will consider in weighing whether to proceed with the planned dates are: the progress of the vaccination programme; news on new variants of the disease; the shift in hospitalisations and deaths; and whether the number of new infections risks overwhelming the NHS. There was no firm news for families hoping to have a summer break abroad. The government said the ban on international travel would continue until at least 17 May. Meanwhile, ministers will carry out a review into how travel – both inbound and outbound – could safely resume, and what measures should be put in place to facilitate it. Another review will be carried out into mask-wearing, social distancing and working from home, all of which are expected to continue for the time being. That review is expected to be completed before step 4 is implemented in June. Unlike last autumn, when different tiered restrictions were imposed at local level, the changes will be England-wide – though small-scale local lockdowns could be imposed if worrying evidence of new variants emerges. Johnson sought to reassure businesses about the financial impact of the gradual reopening plan, promising "we will not pull the rug out" – but left the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to set out the details in next week's budget. Over time, scientists expect Covid-19 to become endemic, meaning the virus will reach a stable, hopefully manageable level. Vaccinations – including revaccinations – will be key to managing the transition from pandemic to endemic state. Therapeutics and antivirals will

<|startofarticle|>  Labour's performance in the 2019 general election was effectively a tiebreaking affair as Owen Paterson gained the support of world leaders including Angela Merkel, who told the Labour leader to "haul around the knees" and "lift your spirits a bit bit bit bit better". Together with Biden, who urged the UK to rebuild its relationship with the US and the EU despite the crisis in the Middle East, Johnson carried out a string of visits to the White House and Washington Capitol before returning to Westminster and shaking hands with President Joe Biden.  After meeting Biden, Johnson was able to announce that he will marry the Washington outsider Carrie Symonds, who was conceived with Johnson as the guest. Number 10 was pleased to say that "at a minimum", Johnson will wear a suit and tie over his official tie – though it will be unclear whether that will be voluntary. The prime minister will hold a string of bilateral meetings with fellow leaders, but is likely to set out a series of pressing issues including securing the transition to a free trade agreement with the US and avoiding default if the EU fails to meet the transition targets set by the UK. The UK had previously kept a low profile lowkey throughout the transition, giving senior advisers the chance to prepare for a divided cabinet, but the reshuffle highlighted concerns among some MPs about the impact of low turnout. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, was among the fewer cabinet ministers who have been expected to express their concerns publicly. He will wear a government-imposed mask and tie as he campaigns for the Labour leadership. Paterson has repeatedly criticised the government's handling of the pandemic, accusing the health secretary of "putting a failing under control" and claiming the government is "putting a failing under the shoulders" by failing to address the underlying problems that led to the current chaos. Johnson's official spokesperson has insisted the crisis had a "single cause" and pointed to the failure of the NHS to perform as promised. But some of the same advisers who have insisted the government has a plan B are missing in action: the industry I know and care about. Like so many other businesses, we were hit by Covid and was left scrambling to figure out what worked and what didn't. Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, will say the story of the past year has been "weathered" by the failings of the government and the private sector, but the party must now focus on other priorities. Rishi Sunak and Paolo Gentiloni have been blamed for a series of embarrassing errors and the resignation of well-respected ministers. Johnson's official spokesperson has repeatedly underlined the fact that Johnson is "back in the game", and the task of restoring the UK to its former self is but a step behind the prime minister's desk. And the Covid-O cabinet subcommittee chair, Michael Gove, was repeatedly heckled and heckled by a small number of sobering cabinet ministers.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Rutger Thaikany has said Brexiters should come forward and identify themselves, with the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) being asked to weigh in on behalf of the UK's employers of UK-based companies. Sajid Javid's team included Christopher Cox, who acted as the liaison between the prime minister and the new EHRC chair, Allegra Stratton.  But the publication of the findings to the House of Commons on Wednesday sparked alarm among charities and some Tory MPs, who were focusing on the domestic aid crisis. "It's a personal loss, and it shows," said Steve Reed. "And it does really underline the fact that, like Sajid's loss, the focus of the pandemic on the shoulders of former staff is unfair, and it shows no signs of being control-freakrage." Cummings may have correctly identified the prime minister as the donor who had the largest financial interest in the development of the AstraZeneca vaccine, but it was unclear which institution would ultimately be responsible. Johnson's new secretary, Neel Kashyap, was openly asked about the funding of the research programme at the earliest, after Cummings had insisted previously that the findings were his. "I don't discuss my findings with the press, no," he said. "I've had many emails, many messages, many good ones, many good that way." Instead, he claimed he "liked the paper very much" and would "go forward and do the research". No 10 sources insisted the findings were disappointing – citing one study suggesting that one in 10 people will change their minds after a day of intense watching. But they appeared to contradict one another, and led to a marked increase in the number of people becoming ill. In studies carried out after the pandemic, scientists had suggested that watching another large-scale, government-wide vaccination programme, over the summer, with the UK's second vaccine set to be outlasting the rest of the world, could help prevent the spread of the virus by preventing the use of booster jabs for England's highest earners. Labour has therefore been monitoring the funding of the events research programme, and said it would take decisive action if necessary. The government has previously backed away from the idea of mandatory Covid certificates, in part because of fears about lack of backbench support. In a recent vote on compulsory vaccinations for care workers 31 Conservatives rebelled. The latest opinion poll showed the government at 39% with Labour at 10%. The union leaders' support among care workers has been cut in half in recent weeks under the auspices of a "win-tough" policy that could help end the crisis in care. In a separate agreement, the union leaders have agreed that the social care cap as well as the rest of the social security plan must be scrapped. The proposals, published on Tuesday, confirmed that the vast majority of the 1.3 million adults receiving the England-wide England insurance will receive a regular care payment over the next three years. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, rejected reports on Tuesday that the government was considering a move to make the £20-a-week payments necessary to pay for the NHS upgrade at a later date. "We are completely focused on making sure that we reach the funding plans we have got, which is quite simply because of the hard work that has gone into it," he said. The prime minister claimed the care cap was "badly needed" as he committed to tackling the deficit after the pandemic. The hospital levy is paid by the state and is intended to fund the NHS and social care. Boris Johnson has claimed the cap will allow the government to "fix the crisis in social care faster than we can get there, and faster than we can get there". He said the cap was "part of the plan" for "cutting waiting lists for care patients". The private and public sector have been key witnesses in the implementation of the government's plan, which was agreed at a cabinet meeting on Monday. Ministers have acknowledged that the waitlist system, which was introduced in the 2010-15 school year, allows too many schools to scrab cash from parents before they can get the care they need. Johnson claimed the waitlist system did not work for students from when they were first allowed to socialise. "It's a complete circle jerk problem. You didn't just come in here to get some sort of education, you've come here to get some sort of career," he said. The prime minister also highlighted the dramatic reduction in the number of rejections among the least-educated class, suggesting the title of the recent "Comparison and comparison questions" test on the NHS shows it is not time to put "dependents" on the disadvantaged. The prime minister said the test, which allows readers to compare residents with the same education and work, would be used to better target at students from more deprived backgrounds.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  The government is investigating the use of "Covid status certificates" to help allow society to reopen, Boris Johnson has announced, as he set out a cautious, four-step unlocking plan for England that will see some sectors remain shuttered until June. "The end really is in sight; and a wretched year will give way to a spring and a summer that will be very different and incomparably better than the picture we see around us today," the prime minister told MPs on Monday as he announced the unlocking plan.  Ministers have repeatedly denied that they would consider the domestic use of so-called vaccine passports, fearing they pose risks of discrimination, as some groups are unable to receive the coronavirus jab. But as part of the government's roadmap out of England's national lockdown, a review will be carried out to assess whether certificates could allow restrictions to be lifted more safely. It is expected to report before June. In a nod to potential objections, Johnson said the review would be, "mindful of the many concerns surrounding exclusion, discrimination and privacy". The keenly awaited roadmap, which the government insists will be dependent on "data, not dates", lays out a four-step reopening process that will see the "stay at home" order remain in place for a further five weeks. With the prime minister keen to avoid having to order a fresh lockdown, he has opted for a gradual lifting of restrictions across England, which is likely to irk some Conservative MPs, who will be given a vote on the plan next month. Schools will reopen to all pupils on 8 March. The only other change at that point will be that two people from different households will be able to meet outside socially, instead of just for exercise. From 29 March, in the second part of step one, the "stay at home" order will lift so people can meet family members in a park or garden, and outdoor sports facilities will be allowed to reopen. In step two, from 12 April, hairdressers and non-essential shops will be allowed to reopen, as well as self-catering accommodation, public buildings such as libraries and museums, and outdoor hospitality such as pub gardens. From 17 May, in step three, most rules on outdoor social contact will be lifted, aside from a limit of 30 on the size of gatherings. Pubs and restaurants will be able to serve customers indoors. In step four, from 21 June, all limits on socialising should be lifted and the government hopes that businesses that were unable to reopen in summer 2020, such as nightclubs, will be able to reopen their doors. The five-week gap between the phases is intended to allow four weeks for data to emerge about the impact of the changes on the disease and a week's notice for the next stage of easing to be introduced. "The chief medical officer is clear that moving any faster would mean acting before we know the impact of each step, which would increase the risk of us having to reverse course and reimpose restrictions. I won't take that risk," the prime minister told the House of Commons. Johnson told MPs: "We're setting out on what I hope and believe is a one-way journey to freedom." He said there was "no credible route" to a zero-Covid Britain - or a zero-Covid world - and argued: "We cannot persist indefinitely with restrictions that debilitate our economy, our physical and mental wellbeing, and the life chances of our children." The factors the government will consider in weighing whether to proceed with the planned dates are: the progress of the vaccination programme; news on new variants of the disease; the shift in hospitalisations and deaths; and whether the number of new infections risks overwhelming the NHS. There was no firm news for families hoping to have a summer break abroad. The government said the ban on international travel would continue until at least 17 May. Meanwhile, ministers will carry out a review into how travel – both inbound and outbound – could safely resume, and what measures should be put in place to facilitate it. Another review will be carried out into mask-wearing, social distancing and working from home, all of which are expected to continue for the time being. That review is expected to be completed before step 4 is implemented in June. Unlike last autumn, when different tiered restrictions were imposed at local level, the changes will be England-wide – though small-scale local lockdowns could be imposed if worrying evidence of new variants emerges. Johnson sought to reassure businesses about the financial impact of the gradual reopening plan, promising "we will not pull the rug out" – but left the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to set out the details in next week's budget. Over time, scientists expect Covid-19 to become endemic, meaning the virus will reach a stable, hopefully manageable level. Vaccinations – including revaccinations – will be key to managing the transition from pandemic to endemic state. Therapeutics and antivirals will

<|startofarticle|>  The government is investigating the use of "Covid status certificates" to help allow society to reopen, Boris Johnson has said, as ministers scramble to establish up to 1m "Covid status cards" to help travellers manage the pandemic. The prime minister opened up about the obscure technology used to back up certificates with requirements about where to book, and the ease with which it was created.  "It's really just a matter of saying 'this is it. We don't know the details yet,' and then using scanners and other things of that nature," he said. "Once the supply chains have been established, the supply chains have been established in such a way that this thing doesn't know what to do with itself." He added: "If they're not careful, this thing could go on going on for months." Johnson last week announced a £350m fund set up to help developing countries to cope with the pandemic in coming months. It is being set up by the former Labour leader Ed Miliband, and set up by the new shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, to accelerate the pace of investment in technology and vaccines in developing countries. There was also a commitment to examine the idea of a "public option" being developed, aimed at removing the need for compulsory vaccination. The idea was examined most closely by the Blair government, who in turn regarded it as a means of undermining their ability to deliver on their manifesto commitments. Streeting told the Guardian his proposals would "build on the achievements" made by Johnson and give a "new, different look to the government". "The way the prime minister proposes it, the way the cabinet proposes it, and the complexity of the details means it will need to be said and done," he said. "We have a new, much better alternative to government making these decisions based on a public option rather than a public option alone." He defended the government's approach on Wednesday, insisting it was picking the right moment to go ahead. "When the prime minister made his presentation to the cabinet on Wednesday, he said he was taking full control of the process and taking full responsibility," he said, adding: "We know this is the right moment to do this and we are taking full responsibility." He added: "The choice in this moment is perfectly clear and we will get into the habit of taking full control of the system and the rollout of the programme." Johnson was cheered by his own cabinet colleagues at the start of their discussions, after a turbulent three-week period that included several backbench rebellions and some senior Tories expressing concern about his grip on government.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  <|startofarticle|> Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, has said her own experience as a care worker helped to convince her more flexible working could be a "win-win" for staff and employers. Speaking to the Guardian after announcing new policies last week on employment rights and flexible conditions, Rayner said she had helped negotiate family-friendly working when she was a trade union representative.  "We were frontline manual workers, delivering 7am till 10pm care in people's homes. We introduced a flexible rota that worked for the staff, and we saw productivity go up. The wellbeing of the staff, as well as the outcome for the service user, was they had the same staff going in – and sickness levels went significantly down as well, so it saved money for the employer. It's a win-win," she said. "Of course, not everything can be achieved in every single workplace, but there are flexible options I believe in every workplace. If an employer looks after the employees, the employees will look after the employer, and it's reciprocal," she added. Rayner announced this week that a Labour government would legislate to give companies an obligation to provide flexible conditions – including compressed hours, and accommodating caring responsibilities such as the school run – unless they can show it is unworkable. It was part of a package of measures, drawn up with the shadow workers' rights minister, Andy McDonald, that also included ensuring all employees gain rights from day one in a job. The plans have been welcomed by the Corbynite campaign group Momentum, and helped to assuage fears among some in the party that Starmer would ditch the radical 2019 manifesto wholesale. Speaking after a visit to a flexible working hub in Hull, Rayner said Labour's aim was nothing less than to achieve a "cultural shift" in the workplace. "It's about changing the culture in our country. The whole emphasis to me is, yes there's individual nuggets in here, but it's about a cultural shift away from people being inflexible, and not looking for new and fresh ideas about how people can engage in the workplace," she said. Rayner shrugged off suggestions that she has been at loggerheads with Keir Starmer – or could even challenge him for the leadership, as some supporters had urged her to do before the Batley and Spen byelection earlier this month. "Me and Keir have been working incredibly closely together since the start of the pandemic," she said, comparing the day when they were both elected in the depths of the first lockdown to "an arranged marriage, almost, by telephone". "We bring different things to that leadership. And I think that works," she said, calling them "yin and yang". Labour's loss of the Hartlepool constituency in May sparked panic about Starmer's prospects of leading Labour to a general election victory, with some MPs quietly casting around for a candidate who could gather the 40 signatures necessary to mount a challenge. But his leadership has appeared more secure since the party held the Yorkshire seat of Batley and Spen. Rayner said she and Starmer had different approaches. "You know, my style is more robust as people know: I'm more bombastic, in the way in which do things, I say it how I see it: and therefore I bring that freshness to the partnership." "Keir's very forensic, he's very intelligent. He's very passionate about making sure that the country is a better place," she said. Rayner has spoken in the past about growing up in poverty, and becoming a carer for her mother, who struggled with mental illness, from the age of 10. "I like to think I overshare and Keir undershares," she said. "If you look at Keir's background, it's not dissimilar for mine: he looked after his mum, I looked after my mum," she says. "Keir wasn't from a privileged background". Challenged about a dip in Labour's membership, Rayner said she was focused on voters. "Of course we want to attract people to be members of the Labour party, but what we need to do is we need to attract voters as well. And what we're doing is we're speaking to the country: we're saying that actually we don't want to be an opposition, we want to be a government," she said. Labour is in the process of laying off up to 90 staff via voluntary redundancies, as Starmer seeks to repair the party's shattered finances after costly election battles and a string of legal cases. The former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott criticised Labour this week for simultaneously seeking to hire staff on six-month contracts to handle a backlog of complaints against members. "So Keir will make Britain the best place to work – unless you work for Labour," Abbott tweeted. Rayner rejected that, highlighting the importance of ensuring the party is financially viable. "We don't want to be making staff redundant
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Corbyn loyalists on the Labour left who had been alienated by Boris Johnson's government are urging Jeremy Corbyn's critics to restore some of the Corbynite brand to the party. Burnham addressed Labour HQ on Friday by video-calling the prime minister's government "corrupt, empty, and abject failures".  "It's time to put our projects back on." By Saturday, most of the leftwing campaign group KOSAF had declined to put up a candidate, after Johnson withdrew from the G7 summit despite urging activists to "jet pack, fly off and stay home", ordering his officials to prepare for a "circuit-breaker" lockdown. As he emerged from the meeting scarred by the day of his departure with a coughing fit, Corbyn did not cut a message to Johnson: "No amount of fancy political footwork will fix the crisis in our time, when the crisis is worse than the crisis in any other country in the world." But Corbyn's allies said that in carrying out a political job, he had become increasingly secure about his private life. Johnson regarded him as an unacceptable compromise, and they were concerned about the risk of embarrassing the Labour leader, who is known to express concerns about the safety of his personal details. The prime minister felt the need to reassure MPs that he was merely pointing the finger at the public. "He doesn't worry about leaking; he just wants to get the word out that the prime minister is focused on getting the economy going," said one senior Conservative who knows both men well. "He believes, as I do, that the highest form of leaking is the proper response when the situation is very, very different from the reaction of the public if they believe you are leaking. "But, equally, the proper response is, 'Sir, I hope this is all talk, and we don't do anything concrete in the future but we can't be deaf and blind to the noise of the situation; and therefore we must all be more than that and to be in a position to take on the job.'" The pair of decisions on Saturday were welcomed by the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, who said: "The business secretary role uses very the same data, very same set of standards – and that takes money and takes jobs." He added: "We've seen record levels of investment in green jobs in recent years. It's only natural that we would want to nurture that economy with the kind of jobs that we are looking to retain." Green was given the green light in July to introduce a new form of certification for polluting vehicles, after Boris Johnson withdrew his support. But as the transition to a net zero energy economy was announced last month, the Treasury was criticised for announcing that consumers would only be charged a "per diem" £100 cost of energy to operate their car. This will be scrapped in the coming months, as the motoring press takes a more active approach.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Boris Johnson has said "we truly did everything we could" to minimise loss of life from coronavirus, and insisted he takes "full responsibility" for the government's handling of the pandemic. But when an inquiry is eventually carried out into the past 12 torrid months, the prime minister will have to face a series of difficult questions about key decisions he made.  As news first began to trickle out of China, triggering the government's pandemic planning, the prime minister left the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to chair the first five meetings of the emergency Cobra committee about the virus. After carrying out a fraught reshuffle of his cabinet, Johnson decamped to the taxpayer-owned mansion of Chevening, and did not chair his first Covid Cobra meeting until 2 March, just before the first confirmed UK death from the virus. Comforted by advisers who compared the challenge to tackling seasonal flu, he tended to play down the seriousness of the pandemic in its early days, insisting it was "business as usual". Most memorably, he told a Downing Street briefing that he "shook hands with everybody" during a hospital visit in early March. With the support of scientific advisers, Johnson took the decision to lift border restrictions on 13 March last year after evidence emerged that the virus was already circulating in the UK, despite a strict quarantine regime for arrivals from Wuhan, in China. At the time, the harsher approach adopted early on by countries such as Singapore and New Zealand, involving flight bans and quarantine, were regarded as extreme by ministers. But many analysts now believe closing the borders was an important precaution that helped these countries and others fare much better. Johnson announced a full-blown lockdown on 23 March last year, with little idea at the time that it would remain in place until July, with many children kept out of the classroom until September. He had edged towards the shutdown via a series of intermediate steps, including banning mass public events and exhorting the public to avoid unnecessary social interaction and to work from home where possible. Only when modelling carried out by Prof Neil Ferguson at Imperial College London suggested there could be up to 500,000 deaths if the virus was not brought under control, and amid growing signs that the public were taking matters into their own hands, did Johnson order the public to stay at home. Some public health experts now believe an earlier shutdown could have saved many thousands of lives. When it emerged that his top adviser had flouted lockdown rules by driving 300-plus miles to Durham, with a day trip to a local town thrown in, Johnson stuck by him resolutely. He told the public at a Downing Street press conference that his aide had acted "responsibly and legally", in crisscrossing the country, ostensibly to seek childcare for his young son, and then to test his eyesight, at a time when the public were being urged to stay at home. His decision sparked an avalanche of angry emails to MPs and risked undermining public confidence in lockdown rules at a critical time. The former TalkTalk executive Dido Harding was brought in by Johnson and Matt Hancock to run the hugely costly test-and-trace system, which has relied heavily on private sector outsourcing and has not worked as effectively as hoped. Councils carrying out their own local contact-tracing operations have generally obtained better results than the call centres run by Serco and other providers, while management consultants have in some cases been paid £7,000 a day for their expertise in setting it up. Johnson and his chancellor, Rishi Sunak, have declined to fix holes in the social safety net – including the paucity of statutory sick pay – that have created a strong financial disincentive for many people to self-isolate. Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance gave the prime minister a briefing on 16 September setting out the dire risks of allowing the virus to run unchecked as cases increased into the autumn. Their colleagues on the Sage committee suggested a short "circuit-breaker" lockdown, perhaps over the October half-term. But Downing Street aides made clear at the time that Johnson considered it to be his role to weigh up scientific advice with other considerations, including the economic and social costs of a fresh lockdown. He therefore opted for a middle course, between the scientists' proposal and the demands of many in his party to resist fresh restrictions: a beefed-up system of "tiers", with tougher rules for the hardest-hit areas. In the event, as Whitty predicted when they were introduced, even the strictest, tier 3 rules did not do enough to restrain the virus, and a month-long lockdown was announced on 31 October. A month before Christmas, the government agreed a plan with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland administrations that would allow up to three households to mix for a fixed five days over the festive period. Johnson then stuck resolutely by the plan, even as cases surged in London and Kent. Matt Hancock alerted the House of Commons to concerns about a new variant of the virus on 14 December,

<|startofarticle|>  Keir Starmer has appointed well-respected north-east of England MP Sharon Hodgson as his new parliamentary aide, as he seeks to smooth relations with Labour backbenchers after last weekend's fraught reshuffle. Hodgson, the MP for Washington and Sunderland West since 2010, replaces Carolyn Harris, who resigned earlier this week amid claims that she had stoked up tensions between Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner.  As Starmer's parliamentary private secretary, her job will be to liaise between backbenchers and the leader's office. Some MPs have complained in recent weeks that they felt neglected by Starmer's team. Hodgson will also bring understanding of the north-east, where Labour lost the Hartlepool byelection last week, and the Conservatives made fresh inroads in local council elections. Labour announced several other junior appointments on Friday evening, as the Labour leader completed the shakeup that began in the wake of last week's election results. Peter Kyle, the Hove MP, will be the shadow schools minister, after Wes Streeting was handed a new role overseeing Labour's child poverty strategy. Streeting announced on Friday that he will step back from Twitter use for the time being as he seeks to focus on running for parliament. Other changes include moving from the shoulders of his deputy, Andrew Dilnot, to Dr Paul Williams, a former leader of the Social Care Party. While the shakeup was initially envisaged as a way of countering the influence of the Murdoch press, some MPs said the impact of the election on family budgets had been profound. "It's like a hurricane hits, and then everyone realises it's just a matter of whoops their head is big enough to hit the pillowcases," one backbench Conservative MP said. Another said the move was the latest example of Starmer trying to tough up public behaviour. "He doesn't understand why people continue to behave the way they are, and then start crying and asking for support. It's clear he doesn't understand the concerns of his constituents." Another said they did, however, mark a shift away from the "gang of five". One MP said the new policy would focus on making it harder for children to get the support they need, while highlighting the need for cronyism. The policy was pulled from the policybook and replaced by a more robust approach, such as a three-year renewal. The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, stressed the new requirements for employers to prove that they have met the "roadmap" of successfully maintaining vaccination status before allowing children to be exempted.

Starmer's plans for overhauling his frontbench last weekend were held up for much of last Sunday by negotiations with Rayner about what role she would be willing to accept. She relinquished the jobs of party chair and national campaign coordinator, and was instead handed the role of shadowing the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, as well as other titles, including shadow secretary of state for the future of work.

<|startofarticle|>  Jeremy Corbyn has pledged to campaign against the arrival of Rupert Murdoch's News UK television channel as he launched his Peace and Justice Project at an online rally. A more "just, free and accountable" media is one of four causes Corbyn is encouraging his supporters to back. He also urged them to help with organising direct support in communities, such as food banks; campaign for a green new deal; and press the government to speed up the delivery of Covid vaccines in developing countries.  "So many of the ideas we need to make the 2020s better than the 2010s were developed in and around the Labour party in recent years, by outstanding thinkers, but more importantly by demands of our movements, and the skills, knowledge and needs of the communities affected," Corbyn said. "We will build on these policies, taking them further, adapting them to the post-pandemic world, so that our movement can turn the dial towards peace and justice." Corbyn was readmitted to the Labour party in November, after being suspended over remarks he made when the Equality and Human Rights Commission published its critical report on the party's handling of antisemitism. But his successor as leader, Keir Starmer, declined to restore the Labour whip to Corbyn, who now sits as an independent MP. The broadcasting regulator, Ofcom, gave the go-ahead last month to Murdoch's right-leaning news channel, which is expected to be on air for four to five hours a night. It is expected to compete with Andrew Neil's GB News, with the pair racing to be the first on air. Corbyn repeatedly criticised the role of the media in public life during his time as leader of the opposition. He was ridiculed in some of Murdoch's newspapers, with the Sun's front page on election day in 2017 urging its readers: "Don't chuck Britain in the Cor-bin." Corbyn gave a lecture at the Edinburgh television festival in 2018 calling for a taxpayer-owned British Digital Corporation to offset the power of multinational corporations in the media, though the policy never found its way into Labour's manifesto. His digital rally also featured Greece's former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis and the Labour MP for Coventry South, Zarah Sultana. The new initiative will not be signing up members but Corbyn hopes to play a convening role in bringing together activists, trade unions and other leftwing groups. Setting out the aims of his new political venture, he appeared to take a sideswipe at his successor, saying: "If you refuse to argue for your side, our opponents win by default." Some of Corbyn's allies believe Starmer has not been sufficiently robust in attacking Boris Johnson's government – and fear backsliding from some of the radical policies set out in the 2019 general election manifesto. Starmer has adopted the slogan "a new leadership" to differentiate his tenure from Corbyn's four-and-a-half-year period at the top of the party.

But when an inquiry is eventually carried out into the past 12 torrid months, the prime minister will have to face a series of difficult questions about key decisions he made.  As news first began to trickle out of China, triggering the government's pandemic planning, the prime minister left the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to chair the first five meetings of the emergency Cobra committee about the virus. After carrying out a fraught reshuffle of his cabinet, Johnson decamped to the taxpayer-owned mansion of Chevening, and did not chair his first Covid Cobra meeting until 2 March, just before the first confirmed UK death from the virus. Comforted by advisers who compared the challenge to tackling seasonal flu, he tended to play down the seriousness of the pandemic in its early days, insisting it was "business as usual". Most memorably, he told a Downing Street briefing that he "shook hands with everybody" during a hospital visit in early March. With the support of scientific advisers, Johnson took the decision to lift border restrictions on 13 March last year after evidence emerged that the virus was already circulating in the UK, despite a strict quarantine regime for arrivals from Wuhan, in China. At the time, the harsher approach adopted early on by countries such as Singapore and New Zealand, involving flight bans and quarantine, were regarded as extreme by ministers. But many analysts now believe closing the borders was an important precaution that helped these countries and others fare much better. Johnson announced a full-blown lockdown on 23 March last year, with little idea at the time that it would remain in place until July, with many children kept out of the classroom until September. He had edged towards the shutdown via a series of intermediate steps, including banning mass public events and exhorting the public to avoid unnecessary social interaction and to work from home where possible. Only when modelling carried out by Prof Neil Ferguson at Imperial College London suggested there could be up to 500,000 deaths if the virus was not brought under control, and amid growing signs that the public were taking matters into their own hands, did Johnson order the public to stay at home. Some public health experts now believe an earlier shutdown could have saved many thousands of lives. When it emerged that his top adviser had flouted lockdown rules by driving 300-plus miles to Durham, with a day trip to a local town thrown in, Johnson stuck by him resolutely. He told the public at a Downing Street press conference that his aide had acted "responsibly and legally", in crisscrossing the country, ostensibly to seek childcare for his young son, and then to test his eyesight, at a time when the public were being urged to stay at home. His decision sparked an avalanche of angry emails to MPs and risked undermining public confidence in lockdown rules at a critical time. The former TalkTalk executive Dido Harding was brought in by Johnson and Matt Hancock to run the hugely costly test-and-trace system, which has relied heavily on private sector outsourcing and has not worked as effectively as hoped. Councils carrying out their own local contact-tracing operations have generally obtained better results than the call centres run by Serco and other providers, while management consultants have in some cases been paid £7,000 a day for their expertise in setting it up. Johnson and his chancellor, Rishi Sunak, have declined to fix holes in the social safety net – including the paucity of statutory sick pay – that have created a strong financial disincentive for many people to self-isolate. Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance gave the prime minister a briefing on 16 September setting out the dire risks of allowing the virus to run unchecked as cases increased into the autumn. Their colleagues on the Sage committee suggested a short "circuit-breaker" lockdown, perhaps over the October half-term. But Downing Street aides made clear at the time that Johnson considered it to be his role to weigh up scientific advice with other considerations, including the economic and social costs of a fresh lockdown. He therefore opted for a middle course, between the scientists' proposal and the demands of many in his party to resist fresh restrictions: a beefed-up system of "tiers", with tougher rules for the hardest-hit areas. In the event, as Whitty predicted when they were introduced, even the strictest, tier 3 rules did not do enough to restrain the virus, and a month-long lockdown was announced on 31 October. A month before Christmas, the government agreed a plan with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland administrations that would allow up to three households to mix for a fixed five days over the festive period. Johnson then stuck resolutely by the plan, even as cases surged in London and Kent. Matt Hancock alerted the House of Commons to concerns about a new variant of the virus on 14 December,

<|startofarticle|>  Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, has said her own experience as a care worker helped to convince her more flexible working could be a "win-win" for staff and employers. Speaking to the Guardian after announcing new policies last week on employment rights and flexible conditions, Rayner said she had helped negotiate family-friendly working when she was a trade union representative.  "When I was in our office, I introduced people to flexible working, we used the flexibility to make the changes we needed to make," she said. "We then worked with staff to make the transition from representative to fully-fledged part-time employees. "It's a win-win," she added. "Of course, not everything can be achieved in every single workplace, but there are flexible options I believe in every workplace. If we work with our heads above water, we can find solutions." Rayner announced this week that a Labour government would legislate to give companies an obligation to provide flexible conditions – including compressed hours, and accommodating caring responsibilities such as the school run – unless they can show it is unworkable. It was part of a package of measures, drawn up with the shadow workers' rights minister, Andy McDonald, that also included ensuring all employees gain rights from day one in a job. The plans have been welcomed by the Corbynite campaign group Momentum, and helped to assuage fears among some in the party that Starmer would ditch the radical 2019 manifesto wholesale. Speaking after a visit to a flexible working hub in Hull, Rayner said Labour's aim was nothing less than to achieve a "cultural shift" in the workplace. "It's about changing the culture in our country. The whole emphasis to me is, yes there's individual nuggets in here, but it's about a cultural shift away from people being inflexible, and not looking for new and fresh ideas about how people can engage in the workplace," she said. Rayner shrugged off suggestions that she has been at loggerheads with Keir Starmer – or could even challenge him for the leadership, as some supporters had urged her to do before the Batley and Spen byelection earlier this month. "Me and Keir have been working incredibly closely together since the start of the pandemic," she said, comparing the day when they were both elected in the depths of the first lockdown to "an arranged marriage, almost, by telephone". "We bring different things to that leadership. And I think that works," she said, calling them "yin and yang". Labour's loss of the Hartlepool constituency in May sparked panic about Starmer's prospects of leading Labour to a general election victory, with some MPs quietly casting around for a candidate who could gather the 40 signatures necessary to mount a challenge. But his leadership has appeared more secure since the party held the Yorkshire seat of Batley and Spen. Rayner said she and Starmer had different approaches. "You know, my style is more robust as people know: I'm more bombastic, in the way in which do things, I say it how I see it: and therefore I bring that freshness to the partnership." "Keir's very forensic, he's very intelligent. He's very passionate about making sure that the country is a better place," she said. Rayner has spoken in the past about growing up in poverty, and becoming a carer for her mother, who struggled with mental illness, from the age of 10. "I like to think I overshare and Keir undershares," she said. "If you look at Keir's background, it's not dissimilar for mine: he looked after his mum, I looked after my mum," she says. "Keir wasn't from a privileged background". Challenged about a dip in Labour's membership, Rayner said she was focused on voters. "Of course we want to attract people to be members of the Labour party, but what we need to do is we need to attract voters as well. And what we're doing is we're speaking to the country: we're saying that actually we don't want to be an opposition, we want to be a government," she said. Labour is in the process of laying off up to 90 staff via voluntary redundancies, as Starmer seeks to repair the party's shattered finances after costly election battles and a string of legal cases. The former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott criticised Labour this week for simultaneously seeking to hire staff on six-month contracts to handle a backlog of complaints against members. "So Keir will make Britain the best place to work – unless you work for Labour," Abbott tweeted. Rayner rejected that, highlighting the importance of ensuring the party is financially viable. "We don't want to be making staff redundant. It's an awful situation but we can't lose a general election, like we did, and then not look at our organisation," she said. And she insisted the complaints-handling staff will not be on zero

<|startofarticle|>  Hobnobbing with tech bosses in California as the hospitality sector howled in pain at the catastrophic impact of the Omicron variant was a rare political misstep for a chancellor whose public image is so carefully polished. Until midweek, the Treasury had stuck carefully to the line that ample financial support was already available to hard-hit hospitality firms – the VAT cut for the sector extends into next spring, for example.  With business groups warning that warm welcome groups could band together to make the UK the next "Covid back to the people," the Treasury has also kicked off a "green industrial revolution" by lifting the cap on consumption of sweet drinks and juices. The flexible system, which applies to staff in a flexible way, is expected to be used to create a nationwide system of charging, rather than to create full-time jobs. It is understood the government still hopes to shoehorn the announcement of a labour marketeer into government policies, though the prime minister has used his autumnal to urge businesses to do the job well. "Look at it this way: it is often the case that the entry requirements for entry to the UK are met with resistance from the outset, while the majority of workers have had the opportunity to get their start in the industry. While we do not intend to order a nationwide rollout of the £100bn Amazon Echo, we are confident that our efforts will be rewarded with more jobs in the industry," he said. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, told the business select committee in July that the government's plans for a "green industrial revolution" were "bad policy and impractical solutions". But the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has declined to say whether he would like Britain to stay in the EU. As he arrived in Washington by train from New York, the prime minister was expressing concern about the difficulties many small businesses are likely to face as the economy emerges from the Covid crisis.  With many sectors including food production continuing to suffer as retailers scramble to increase reach, Sunak is expected to say "we cannot afford this and this must be prevented", as he tours the country with his new national insurance colleague, Elliot Kanchan. Widening the EU's reach risks opening the door to a new class of tax, which would introduce much wider swaths of the country – and some Conservative MPs have already said they would boycott the US if we were to move beyond "tag team". Sunak met Kanchan more closely in the summer, after the pair won the trolley together at Westminster. Kanchan has been widely expected to be offered a role in the White House but said he was "locked in a very difficult decision" about whether to take the role. Sunak is known to have been irked by the investigation into the funding of his 2019 Christmas holiday, which was one of a series of questions about his finances as he prepared to fly to Washington. The prime minister's ethics adviser, Lord Geidt, wrote to all 13 MPs on Wednesday, implicating them in a series of breaches of the rules on lobbying, as well as allegedly leaking to the media. He said: "It is vital, especially during this Christmas period, that our public officials are properly protected." The letter, which was sent to MPs, also included a link to a report about the use of taxpayer's money to enrich colleagues. It is understood that the committee that vets taxpayer-funded opposition research on behalf of MPs asked for only fair value for money, not extra tax, on the tens of thousands of such cases, which is expected to rise. Sunak is expected to stress that despite the challenges facing him, he has "a very strong team" working hard to rectify the "irreversible damage" the tax deal has caused. Working from home guidance is expected to be scrapped, for example, with the emphasis placed instead on personal responsibility. Masks may be recommended in the autumn.
====================
<|startofarticle|> Self-isolation is now only awarded to two people, once they've been in contact with a dead relative.  Sajid Javid's decision to issue non-essential holiday hospitality passes to staff and contractors in March and to keep open large-scale redundancies was seen as a way of reassuring sceptical staff that they would be able to focus on their jobs and take time out of their busy lives. But the government believes that personal use of the facilities will help prevent the need for tougher restrictions over winter. Speaking to BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Javid said he wanted to make the UK "the most free and independent place on the planet". He said that even if the NHS was not reopening, he wanted to "go long enough – get Covid right earlier than planned, and then it's back to normal business as usual". He added: "Could we have done things differently? Perhaps we could." The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been more cautious in recent weeks about pushing ahead with plans to introduce vaccine passports for venues such as nightclubs. Asked about the issue on Thursday, Javid said the government's aim was to make it easier for staff to come and go as they please, and that the policy would be published "before Christmas". The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has declined to say whether he will visit the NHS at all in Covid-19 on Friday. When the prime minister visited hospital this week, heusedactionDate the auspicious name of a social enterprise to promote vaccine uptake. The prime minister is keen to show the government is serious about tackling health inequalities in its bid to make sure people in many parts of England are able to receive vaccinated mates.  Javid said on Wednesday that the government hoped to tackle the inequalities that exist in the workplace by allowing staff to be asked to work from home where possible, as well as by allowing the final two weeks of a shift at least 25 per cent full time. "What we're saying is that the government are looking at all sorts of different things," he said, adding that they included whether there was a significant wave of infections that would undermine the effectiveness of the vaccination programme. "We're assessing all of these things against the backdrop of the pandemic and the fact that the number one priority of the government is the levelling up of the economy. And so it's looking at all of these things against the backdrop of the pandemic," he said, referring to the economic impact of the coronavirus, which is already plaguing businesses in parts of the UK. "We have a new vaccine, we have vaccines against coronavirus, and we are rapidly working through the best thing we can do to make sure that happens." The prime minister is expected to make a brief visit to the Cop26 climate summit in France on Thursday, where he was due to meet the prime minister and French president, Emmanuel Macron, but abruptly stepped up the attacks on the government on Wednesday. He said: "We have no choice. We have to face the facts now. The facts are clearly not with us." The row with the EU over vaccine supplies was sparked when the pair met for drinks in a festive shower at the Eden Project in London. Approximately 35 bottles of Symonds' Can 100 were reportedly sent off to Royal Mail for processing, but the company said they had not been specifically ordered to produce vaccines. When the chancellor tried to persuade the staff at the Edinburgh whisky distillery to let him into their premises, they were told they could not be vaccinated, and that was a reason to "avoid sharing information".  Nevertheless, when the Scottish government minister for the future of bilateral relations, Alok Sharma, asked about the issue on Thursday, he said: "We understand that the protocol is complex and we would not like it if the world caught wind of it." Since the weekend, some reports have suggested the UK may have to reintroduce compulsory self-isolation – a ban that would mean that many workers have to wear masks and take long-distance calls with relative ease. Downing Street has reacted with fury, with the prime minister arguing on Twitter that the protocol was "like compulsory vaccination". His former adviser Dominic Cummings has repeatedly criticised the government's handling of the pandemic in recent weeks, claiming that in announcing the changes to the vaccination programme, Johnson was not only ignorant but reckless. Turnout in the House of Commons was only just above the 50% legal threshold for triggering article 50, which allows legislation to pass without a Labour vote. The new cabinet committee chair, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has suggested the government could struggle to get the reforms through. The former permanent secretary to the Treasury, Simon Clarke, tweeted: "Boris Johnson is like Tony Blair in the 1980s when ministers wrote to unions and unions said they could not bear the thought of working people having to carry their ID into work. Now ministers say we can & will get them through." Johnson's official spokesperson has insisted that the changes to the system were the product
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour is calling on the Conservative party to pay back £580,000 of taxpayers' money spent by the government on polling, including testing public attitudes to Keir Starmer, at the height of the Covid crisis. Angela Rayner has written to the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, urging him to investigate the contract, which was awarded after the personal intervention of Boris Johnson's then chief adviser, Dominic Cummings.  Rayner said: "Conservative ministers have abused taxpayers' money for their own party political interests and the Conservative party needs to repay this money immediately. "Taxpayers' money is not the personal cashpoint of Tory ministers to do as they please with. We need a fully independent inquiry into how much taxpayers' money has been abused in this way and which rules were broken by the ministers and special advisers who authorised it." Cummings phoned his former Vote Leave colleague Paul Stephenson, who also worked on the Tories' 2019 general election campaign, to ask if Stephenson's company, Hanbury Strategy, could carry out the work in March last year. As part of the polling contract, the company examined public attitudes to Starmer and London mayor Sadiq Khan. One proposal under discussion at the time was to hold joint press conferences with Johnson and Starmer, against the backdrop of concerns about compliance with lockdown, in particular among members of the public who mistrusted the Conservatives. The plan was rejected by Downing Street before it had even been mooted with Starmer's team, but Labour argues that by testing the public's attitude to the Labour leader and Khan, Hanbury was carrying out political work, which should never have been funded with taxpayers' money. Hanbury had previously been brought in to sift potential candidates to be special advisers in Johnson's government. Rayner has called on Case to investigate whether Johnson or cabinet office minister Michael Gove, the former chair of Vote Leave, were involved in awarding the contract – and whether other sums of public money were spent on political activities. The contract with Hanbury, to conduct opinion polls on the public's view of the government's Covid response, is subject to a legal challenge by the Good Law Project (GLP), which argues that it shows "apparent bias". Documents made public at a court hearing last Friday included an email sent on 20 March 2020, in which Cummings asked the most senior civil servant responsible for contracts to sign off the budget immediately, and that if "anybody in CABOFF [the Cabinet Office] whines", to tell them Cummings had "ordered it" from the prime minister. The Cabinet Office, which is defending the GLP's challenge, has insisted it acted lawfully, and that the polling was used to shape public health messaging at a critical time in the pandemic. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: "We do not carry out party political polling." They added that an independent review of cabinet office procurement had already been carried out last December by Nigel Boardman. A Hanbury spokesperson said the company agreed to do the work "at extremely short notice" although it involved reputational risk. They said: "Our work contributed to what was a hugely successful public health communications campaign which undoubtedly prevented many deaths. For that reason, if we had to make the choice again we would still agree to step up and help in this time of crisis."
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Jeremy Corbyn will be granted a pass to Labour's conference in Brighton later this month and will be free to address fringe meetings despite currently sitting as an independent MP, a party spokesperson has said. The former leader, who had the whip suspended by Keir Starmer last year, has applied for a conference pass and accepted invitations to speak at several events, the Guardian understands.  Amid a growing row about whether Corbyn should be allowed to attend, a spokesperson said: "He's definitely not barred: of course he will be getting a conference pass." The last time Corbyn attended Labour conference in 2019 – also in Brighton – it was as party leader, when the event was curtailed after the supreme court struck down Boris Johnson's prorogation of parliament. Three months later, the party plunged to its worst electoral defeat since 1935. Starmer's team had faced a mounting backlash after the chair of Young Labour, Jess Barnard, complained she had been told Corbyn would not be allowed to speak at the group's conference event. Labour sources said the Young Labour event was a formal part of Labour conference, and as such the speakers would have to be vetted separately. But they confirmed Corbyn would be allowed to speak at fringe meetings in the conference centre, which do not form part of Labour's formal programme or take place on the main conference stage. Corbyn supporters had warned that rejecting his conference application would be a provocation by Starmer. "He is a Labour member: he should be entitled to attend any meeting in the conference zone," said Richard Burgon, the Leeds East MP who chairs the Socialist Campaign Group of leftwing MPs. "If the leadership decided to bar him from the conference, they would be doing so as a provocative act towards the membership, hoping that more leftwing members leave," he added. Corbyn will also be free to address events at the World Transformed event, which is taking place outside the formal conference zone. One senior party aide said the leadership had faced a "lose-lose" decision about whether to admit him to the main conference venue, raising the spectre of Boris Johnson's packed-out speech at Tory conference in 2018 during Theresa May's premiership. Corbyn had his membership of Labour restored last November by the party's ruling national executive committee (NEC), but Starmer has declined to restore the whip, meaning Corbyn now sits as an independent. Starmer told the Guardian last month that in order to be welcomed back into the fold, Corbyn would have to apologise for, and take down, comments made in the aftermath of the publication of the damning Equality and Human Rights Commission report on Labour's handling of antisemitism complaints. In a statement that remains online, Corbyn claimed the scale of antisemitism in Labour was "dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party". Starmer's team hope the first in-person conference since he was elected leader will be a showcase for Labour's values and policies. But a row had already erupted about Young Labour day, which was meant to form part of the usual conference schedule. Barnard has complained that Young Labour has not been given the support from the party's general secretary, David Evans, that it needed to hold an event, and was told it would not be allowed to have Corbyn as a speaker. The NEC recently agreed to proscribe four leftwing groups. Some MPs claim Starmer is carrying out a purge of Corbyn-supporting elements of the party, though the leadership say they are simply following through on their determination to root out antisemitism.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Jeremy Corbyn has pledged to campaign against the arrival of Rupert Murdoch's News UK television channel as he launched his Peace and Justice Project at an online rally. A more "just, free and accountable" media is one of four causes Corbyn is encouraging his supporters to back. He also urged them to help with organising direct support in communities, such as food banks; campaign for a green new deal; and press the government to speed up the delivery of Covid vaccines in developing countries.  "So many of the ideas we need to make the 2020s better than the 2010s were developed in and around the Labour party in recent years, by outstanding thinkers, but more importantly by demands of our movements, and the skills, knowledge and needs of the communities affected," Corbyn said. "We will build on these policies, taking them further, adapting them to the post-pandemic world, so that our movement can turn the dial towards peace and justice." Corbyn was readmitted to the Labour party in November, after being suspended over remarks he made when the Equality and Human Rights Commission published its critical report on the party's handling of antisemitism. But his successor as leader, Keir Starmer, declined to restore the Labour whip to Corbyn, who now sits as an independent MP. The broadcasting regulator, Ofcom, gave the go-ahead last month to Murdoch's right-leaning news channel, which is expected to be on air for four to five hours a night. It is expected to compete with Andrew Neil's GB News, with the pair racing to be the first on air. Corbyn repeatedly criticised the role of the media in public life during his time as leader of the opposition. He was ridiculed in some of Murdoch's newspapers, with the Sun's front page on election day in 2017 urging its readers: "Don't chuck Britain in the Cor-bin." Corbyn gave a lecture at the Edinburgh television festival in 2018 calling for a taxpayer-owned British Digital Corporation to offset the power of multinational corporations in the media, though the policy never found its way into Labour's manifesto. His digital rally also featured Greece's former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis and the Labour MP for Coventry South, Zarah Sultana. The new initiative will not be signing up members but Corbyn hopes to play a convening role in bringing together activists, trade unions and other leftwing groups. Setting out the aims of his new political venture, he appeared to take a sideswipe at his successor, saying: "If you refuse to argue for your side, our opponents win by default." Some of Corbyn's allies believe Starmer has not been sufficiently robust in attacking Boris Johnson's government – and fear backsliding from some of the radical policies set out in the 2019 general election manifesto. Starmer has adopted the slogan "a new leadership" to differentiate his tenure from Corbyn's four-and-a-half-year period at the top of the party.

<|startofarticle|>  Brazil's president, Jair Bolson, has said the "vast majority" of the people contacted by the government since the end of last spring have so far been able to receive the vaccination through their local post offices. Asked about the figures on Friday, the health secretary said: "There are a million things that have changed, but one of the things that we're very proud of is the ability to deliver on the manifesto promise." "We're very confident that the first wave of the virus have begun to overwhelm the second wave of virus," he added. Asked whether the government in Brasilia had blocked the delivery of 10m doses from India and Pakistan, he said: "Yes, there are a series of measures that we are taking to ensure that as soon as possible we can deliver the vaccines and the equipment that we need to do so." The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said on Sunday that the government was hoping some rules could be loosened in March, depending on the success of the vaccine rollout. Ministers are also waiting to see whether the vaccine prevents transmission of the disease. Johnson has never precisely defined what "levelling up", one of the key themes of his election campaign, actually means, or how he will measure whether he is succeeding. Conservative thinktank Onward also called on Monday for the chancellor to consider reforming the tax system, including by making council tax fairer, to close the gap between north and south. Onward's director, Will Tanner, said, "if we don't use the tax system as well as spending we'll be trying to level up with one hand tied behind our back. If levelling up is to succeed, we need to use the tax system to drive regional growth too."

<|startofarticle|>  "Freedom is in our sights once again!" Sajid Javid told Conservative MPs on Tuesday, as he announced that double-jabbed people will not be required to quarantine from 16 August if they come in contact with a Covid sufferer. That mid-August date was the one concession to caution in a package of measures for "freedom day" that was more liberal than many at Westminster had expected, and has led Labour to accuse the government of being reckless.  Ministers willingly acknowledge that the approach they are taking, of lifting all restrictions at once, is a gamble, which might cause cases to surge – but they maintain that now is the moment to act. "Whenever you unlock, there's a third wave, right?" said one senior Conservative. Given what they regard as the political impossibility of leaving restrictions in place in the long term, the judgment became about which date was the least risky. The 21 June moment initially set for step four of the roadmap in February was rejected, to give the NHS a chance to push up vaccination rates. But by 19 July, the government expects two-thirds of adults to have received both doses. With most schools breaking up in the week of 19 July, that data also coincides with the "firebreak", when school-age children, who remain unvaccinated, are away from their classmates for six weeks. The government fears that if it pushes the reopening later, the resulting sharp increase in cases would start to crash into the usual autumn/winter increase in seasonal flu. Cooler weather and indoor socialising also make happy hunting grounds for the virus. "We know Covid loves winter," as one government source put it. So ultimately the "quad" of senior ministers opted to press ahead with 19 July. Perhaps more controversially, they opted for a full-blooded version of "freedom day" that will ditch almost all restrictions. The outlines of the package announced on Monday were broadly agreed at a meeting of the quad – Javid, Johnson, Rishi Sunak and Michael Gove – on Thursday, according to government sources, with key details including how and when the schools policy would be announced ironed out on Sunday. The go-ahead was then given by the Covid-O cabinet subcommittee on Monday, before the wider cabinet was consulted. Modelling presented to ministers before the decisions suggested that although infections could reach an unprecedented 100,000 a day, hospitalisations were likely to peak at a level lower than during the January wave. However, though Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance ultimately agreed that reopening should go ahead, both have warned that contingency plans must be made for the autumn. Several senior Tories suggested the presence of the more libertarian Javid around the table, instead of Matt Hancock, was likely to have tipped the balance towards a bolder approach. Downing Street insists that his presence was not the deciding factor, pointing out that Boris Johnson has been insisting since before Hancock's humiliation that the 19 July date would be a "terminus". But one government source conceded that "having the health secretary as cover definitely made a difference". Another senior Conservative who knows the players well said it was evident that the decision had been reached without "the counterbalance of Matt". The prime minister's former adviser Dominic Cummings has repeatedly portrayed Johnson as anti-restrictions, and Conservative MPs have been increasingly vocal in calling for the public to be given the freedoms they were promised vaccination would bring. Javid's arrival appears to have cemented that view. The health secretary is such a fan of The Fountainhead, the libertarian fable by the American author and philosopher Ayn Rand, made into a 1949 film starring Gary Cooper, that he once confessed to reading the courtroom scene aloud to his future wife. In it, the character played by Cooper in the film, Howard Roark, forcefully defends the right of individuals to make their own decisions, rather than be subordinated to "the collective". Javid's aides insist he is motivated not by ideology, but a hard-nosed assessment of the costs of continuing restrictions, not just for the economy but for the NHS, which has built up a huge backlog of non-Covid work. And ministers appear to have taken the view, "If not now, then when?" But by ditching masks – which polls suggest the public would like to keep in some circumstances – throwing open nightclubs and giving the green light to standing six deep in crowded bars, some more cautious Tories believe the government is setting itself up for yet another embarrassing U-turn.
====================
<|startofarticle|> Angela Rayner has been demoted from the shadow cabinet and demoted from the shadow cabinet rapporteur on the impacts of the Omicron wave on the health and wellbeing of the public, to the shadow cabinet liaison role. The reshuffle of the shadow cabinet was triggered by the departure of the celebrated social policy expert Hanan Sri Mapes from the Department for International Trade, after a row about his controversial Northern Ireland protocol.  Rayner, who has been a vocal critic of the National Farmers Union (NFU), went to the prime minister's office scrambling to establish what staff were going to be back in their constituencies by Monday morning. Rayner and a string of other senior Tories had hoped she would shadow the pots and pans in her role as foreign secretary, but she is moving to the shadow cabinet and will be attending a dinner on trade policy on Wednesday. Asked about the tightness of the post-Brexit picture, Rayner said: "It's not been easy. It's been extremely difficult negotiations, and we all owe her debt of gratitude to her staff." The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, responding to a question about whether Rayner has had the "bow and umbrella" to prove it, said she was "learning in real time" during the crisis. "The message that we're receiving is that the economic impact of this pandemic has been extremely small – and it's impacting us all directly," he said. "We know that the economic impact of this is only going to get worse, and the best way forward is for us to take immediate action."
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Jeremy Corbyn has pledged to campaign against the arrival of Rupert Murdoch's News UK television channel as he launched his Peace and Justice Project at an online rally. A more "just, free and accountable" media is one of four causes Corbyn is encouraging his supporters to back. He also urged them to help with organising direct support in communities, such as food banks; campaign for a green new deal; and press the government to speed up the delivery of Covid vaccines in developing countries.  "So many of the ideas we need to make the 2020s better than the 2010s were developed in and around the Labour party in recent years, by outstanding thinkers, but more importantly by demands of our movements, and the skills, knowledge and needs of the communities affected," Corbyn said. "We will build on these policies, taking them further, adapting them to the post-pandemic world, so that our movement can turn the dial towards peace and justice." Corbyn was readmitted to the Labour party in November, after being suspended over remarks he made when the Equality and Human Rights Commission published its critical report on the party's handling of antisemitism. But his successor as leader, Keir Starmer, declined to restore the Labour whip to Corbyn, who now sits as an independent MP. The broadcasting regulator, Ofcom, gave the go-ahead last month to Murdoch's right-leaning news channel, which is expected to be on air for four to five hours a night. It is expected to compete with Andrew Neil's GB News, with the pair racing to be the first on air. Corbyn repeatedly criticised the role of the media in public life during his time as leader of the opposition. He was ridiculed in some of Murdoch's newspapers, with the Sun's front page on election day in 2017 urging its readers: "Don't chuck Britain in the Cor-bin." Corbyn gave a lecture at the Edinburgh television festival in 2018 calling for a taxpayer-owned British Digital Corporation to offset the power of multinational corporations in the media, though the policy never found its way into Labour's manifesto. His digital rally also featured Greece's former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis and the Labour MP for Coventry South, Zarah Sultana. The new initiative will not be signing up members but Corbyn hopes to play a convening role in bringing together activists, trade unions and other leftwing groups. Setting out the aims of his new political venture, he appeared to take a sideswipe at his successor, saying: "If you refuse to argue for your side, our opponents win by default." Some of Corbyn's allies believe Starmer has not been sufficiently robust in attacking Boris Johnson's government – and fear backsliding from some of the radical policies set out in the 2019 general election manifesto. Starmer has adopted the slogan "a new leadership" to differentiate his tenure from Corbyn's four-and-a-half-year period at the top of the party.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  The health secretary has said the government may need to reintroduce mandatory face masks and advise the public to work from home, as he set out the government's plans for coping with Covid in England through the autumn and winter. Sajid Javid told the House of Commons: "Any responsible government must prepare for all eventualities," as he outlined what he called the government's "plan B" in the event that the virus surges.  He conceded that mask-wearing and vaccine passports for crowded venues could be introduced if necessary – as well as "communicating clearly and urgently to the public the need for caution". But he did not mention lockdowns, as he informed the MPs of what he called his "plan A" for managing the virus, "without the need for stringent economic and social restrictions". "We must be vigilant," he told MPs. More details of the government's contingency measures have been set out in a document published alongside Javid's statement, including plans for vaccine passports. The prime minister announced in July that it would be compulsory to prove vaccination status before entering nightclubs and other crowded venues. The government has since backed away from the plan after a backlash from Tory MPs, but Javid confirmed it was being held in reserve. The document says vaccine passports would be applied to all nightclubs; all indoor, crowded settings with 500 or more people such as music venues; all outdoor settings with 4,000 or more people such as festivals; and any venue with 10,000 or more people, such as big sports matches. It acknowledges the plans may need to be implemented at short notice – and encourages businesses to introduce vaccine passports voluntarily. The document also includes advice to the public about how they should behave as winter approaches. They are urged to meet outdoors where possible, keep windows open when meeting indoors, and think twice about activities such as singing or dancing. "In general, the risk of catching or passing on Covid-19 is higher in crowded spaces (where there are more people who might be infectious) and in enclosed indoor spaces (where there is limited fresh air)," the document says. "Some activities, such as singing, dancing and exercising can also increase the risk of transmission of Covid-19 as people are doing activities which generate more particles as they breathe. The risk is greatest where these factors overlap." The public are also cautioned to "wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed settings" – advice taken by very few of the Conservative MPs sitting behind Javid in a busy Commons chamber as he spoke. The government also pointedly refuses to rule out imposing a fresh lockdown. "While the government expects that, with strong engagement from the public and businesses, these contingency measures should be sufficient to reverse a resurgence in autumn or winter, the nature of the virus means it is not possible to give guarantees," the plan says. "The government remains committed to taking whatever action is necessary to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed but more harmful economic and social restrictions would only be considered as a last resort." Plan B would be invoked, the document says, "if the data suggests the NHS is likely to come under unsustainable pressure". Javid said 81% of people over 16 had received two doses of Covid vaccination, and the link between infections, hospitalisation and deaths had been "weakened significantly", so that deaths from the current wave had been "mercifully low". He said the government's plan A included five pillars: renewing efforts to maximise vaccine uptake and expanding it to 12- to 15-year-olds; maintaining the test-and-trace system, including encouraging regular asymptomatic testing; boosting funding for the NHS and social care; encouraging people to modify their behaviour, such as meeting outside; and cooperating with international partners. Javid also confirmed the government would publish a new framework for international travel before the end of this month. Earlier, the government's health advisers announced their recommendation that booster jabs be delivered to the over-50s and younger people with underlying health conditions that make them vulnerable to the virus. Javid confirmed he would take that advice. Children aged between 12 and 15 will also be offered one dose of the Pfizer vaccine, as recommended by the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, and his colleagues. Javid also said it was "highly likely", that vaccination would be made compulsory for frontline NHS workers.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Jeremy Corbyn's supporters reacted with fury after the announcement that the end of the Corbyn era could be within reach, as the leader's office warned that pressing ahead with plans to roll out the "new" "social care cap" risked creating a "death tax" for already struggling families. Scores of MPs began a hunger strike on Friday, more than two weeks after the announcement of the new national insurance increase, after the government's own data showed that the top end of the increase in national insurance would be eroded by the end of the cap.  Addressing MPs on Saturday, the prime minister said: "The cap will be lifted – and will be significantly enhanced – by the lifting of the social care cap. "The social care increase will be levied on people who are already in work and have assets that enable them to provide better quality and living standards for their families. "The cap will be increased, without any increase in national insurance, by 1.25 percentage points. "The social care increase will be levied on people who are already in work and have assets that enable them to provide better quality and living standards for their families. "The cap will be increased, by 1.5 percentage points, on children already in work, and those already in work and living in poverty. "The cap will be increased, by 10 percentage points, on people who are already in care homes and have access to social care." He was speaking alongside the prime minister at a Downing Street press conference where the health secretary, Sajid Javid, said proposals announced by the government on Friday would allow the government to use mental health funding to help struggling families cope with the aftermath of the pandemic.  "We will use this funding to help the most vulnerable people in the world, by providing them with the mental health services they need," he said. The prime minister highlighted that the criteria for applying for the new national insurance concession were new, and the measures would be effective for Wales. "We begin the new year stronger than ever before," he said. The new health and social care system will be called the "fiscal cliff" to give firms and individuals more time to redraw the plan, and give ministers more leeway to raise taxes on businesses. The chancellor said that existing tax revenues could be used to help the public services provided that the system was well-suited to the demands of the times. "The welfare state is designed to work for one group of people. That one group can afford to hire more staff, or they can afford to hire more staff in particular areas," he said. The social care cap will be high, flexible and effective – but the chancellor said few details were being announced on how the new tax would be calculated. "Nothing is known right now," he said, adding that no final decision on the way the new tax will be set out in the budget could be announced until the end of January, when the UK has due to expire at the end of 2019. The social care cap will beestimated as £6.2bn over the next three years, with the economy growing by an average of 1.7% annually in some areas. The government has sought to cushion the blow for some families by imposing flexible hours, and by maintaining the cap as much as possible flexible hours. At Lancaster House, the prime minister said the family reunion would be one of the most special events of the year, with the government's ministers spending lavishly on receptions and autograph sessions. "The best part about this year's family reunion is, you can meet other loved ones in person, and take a moment to think about all the people you know," he said. The prime minister said he could not say the government was committed to the idea of a green new deal, but said he hoped it would be a "turning point" for the country. "I know that some people find that straightforward. They see opportunity. But there is more to it than that," he said. The family reunion was meant to mark the return of a longtime friend, the former BBC journalist and political analyst Ben Wood, who is being sought after as a potential Conservative candidate in the Midlands. Wood founded the blog ConservativeHome and served as the party's general secretary from July 2018. He was speaker of the local authority in the West Midlands at the time. Echoing the message of one of the early posts on Vote Leave.org, Wood said he believed the "new leader" could "set the standard for the rest of parliament". "He or she is entirely responsible for putting together a busy month, so to speak," he said. "Of course, there will be some big debates about what the opposition parties have done in the past, and what they haven't done. But generally speaking, what we want to see is an opportunity for an opportunity to show that there is energy in the party, and that we want to see them taking on this important role in the future."
====================
<|startofarticle|>  The government is investigating the use of "Covid status certificates" to help allow society to reopen, Boris Johnson has announced, as he set out a cautious, four-step unlocking plan for England that will see some sectors remain shuttered until June. "The end really is in sight; and a wretched year will give way to a spring and a summer that will be very different and incomparably better than the picture we see around us today," the prime minister told MPs on Monday as he announced the unlocking plan.  Ministers have repeatedly denied that they would consider the domestic use of so-called vaccine passports, fearing they pose risks of discrimination, as some groups are unable to receive the coronavirus jab. But as part of the government's roadmap out of England's national lockdown, a review will be carried out to assess whether certificates could allow restrictions to be lifted more safely. It is expected to report before June. In a nod to potential objections, Johnson said the review would be, "mindful of the many concerns surrounding exclusion, discrimination and privacy". The keenly awaited roadmap, which the government insists will be dependent on "data, not dates", lays out a four-step reopening process that will see the "stay at home" order remain in place for a further five weeks. With the prime minister keen to avoid having to order a fresh lockdown, he has opted for a gradual lifting of restrictions across England. From 2023-24, everyone will be required to prove they have been vaccinated by 6 March, a point likely to be reached before the end of the year. At that point, however, the system will be considerably more difficult to implement, and the government is now understood to be considering the possibility of cutting back on vaccination altogether. Johnson's official spokesperson has insisted the decision was taken in consultation with "factories and businesses concerned about the risks of drift and the need for good-quality, double-jabbed vaccines". Other factors the government have considered include the complexity of the vaccine rollout and the ability of many venues such as pubs to handle the large volume of travel. The impact of the government's "stay at home" order on mixing among friends and family members was lifted on Monday afternoon, in response to a petition by the British Medical Association (BMA) and the Association for the Protection of Children from the Dynamics of Covid. The ban on new variants of the disease is aimed at preventing the new variants appearing on older variants, and will also apply to new heights and indoor spaces. The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, stressed at Monday's press conference that the aim of the ban is to limit the spread of the "newest" variant, meaning that it will be harder to suppress.  He insisted that the government had only announced the plan to the public at Monday's press conference, and had not previously considered the possibility that it could be introduced in a specific part of the country. Whitty said the government had only recently begun to learn about the potential for new variants in the winter, and had not yet suggested any new restrictions could be expected to be imposed until June. "The autumn and winter we are going to have to move back into a more naturalistic model of how we are going to get there," he said. He said the government had also published a series of updates at the end of September warning of the rapid pace of the spread of the new variant. Johnson said the updates were "warm showers" that he and the prime minister hoped would be more infectious, but which could reflect the fact that people have continued to go back to their old, unvaccinated selves as they repaired the virus. He said the new variant had had more than 100,000 doses so far, and that the true number could yet be seen, but it appeared that the new strain appeared to be very, very, very old. Johnson said the UK had approximately 10% of the world's population whooping cough. "Symptoms of the virus can vary widely depending on the nature of the virus, the source of its infection and the stage of its spread," he said. The prime minister was speaking at a Downing Street press conference alongside the health secretary, Sajid Javid, and the chief executive of NHS England, Amanda Pritchard. Shortly before the briefing began, the UK's health secretary, Sajid Javid, objected to the abbreviation LHA for "last ditch measures" in the form the government is taking. Pritchard said the abbreviation was used to differentiate between seasonal and regular changes in the workload, and to narrow the cut-through to employers and family members.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Keir Starmer is continuing to reshuffle his inner circle, in an effort to more closely follow through on the promise to cut corporation tax, on Capitol Hill colleagues have complained. The chancellor is expected to use his annual speech on Tuesday to urge the public sector to make more money for their constituents.  "So many of the people who have come before us have made a real contribution to our country, or have been a real part of our country growing up in a peace that is still strong and independent, not just as a family but as a community too," Starmer will say. He will highlight the economic opportunity the UK has to offer, pointing out that Churchillian growth was not yet sustained, though it was slowly but surely bottled up into the rest of Europe. Though Starmer is not expected to mention his predecessor by name, the wide-ranging reshuffle is being overseen by George Osborne, who is known to have been irked by the idea of a recall petition winning a hearing. At his press conference: "We will be removing the Speaker from his post." That will be good news for Labour, who has tended to play down the importance of the position in recent weeks. The party is also keen to remove any suggestion that it is a "cower" party, devoid of the seriousness of the climate crisis or facing a tough winter. Starmer is also keen to bring up-to-date information about new vaccine variants, and to ensure MPs get the support they need. The shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Bridget Phillipson, said: "It's about time. It's about time we got it right. The last thing to make it difficult is to tear up the agreement that protects the earth and the people it protects. "It is vital that we got it right last time, and then got it done this way." The government is keen to have the final say on whether to proceed as planned with the final stage of reopening, with a final decision expected to be made by the prime minister over the summer. The process of phasing out the mandatory mask-wearing and lifting the caps on socialising had been in place since before the pandemic. Several opposition parties have already made the point that the reintroduction of the unwarranted habit of mandatory masks would not be likely to have any effect on preventing the government from taking the necessary actions on the climate emergency. "The mask rule hasn't helped the pandemic either," said James Johnson, a pollster with JL Partners. "The public don't want to hear the government's account of why it's necessary for something to be impossible." He said the mask rule had been implemented "quite a lot better" than the pre-existing mask-wearing scheme, which relied heavily on community complaints. "The mask rule hasn't helped the pandemic either." He would like Labour to back the changes in the coming months, given the difficulty of striking a balanced deal. The shadow cabinet office minister, Rachel Reeves, recently promised a "win-win" for businesses by allowing staff to leave their posts as soon as they are asked to work, instead of waiting until the end of the year. And the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, said, "it is the right thing to do" because of the transparency of the changes.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour is calling on the Conservative party to pay back £580,000 of taxpayers' money spent by the government on polling, including testing public attitudes to Keir Starmer, at the height of the Covid crisis. Angela Rayner has written to the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, urging him to investigate the contract, which was awarded after the personal intervention of Boris Johnson's then chief adviser, Dominic Cummings.  Rayner said: "Conservative ministers have abused taxpayers' money for their own party political interests and the Conservative party needs to repay this money immediately. "Taxpayers' money is not the personal cashpoint of Tory ministers to do as they please with. We need a fully independent inquiry into how much taxpayers' money has been abused in this way and which rules were broken by the ministers and special advisers who authorised it." Cummings phoned his former Vote Leave colleague Paul Stephenson, who also worked on the Tories' 2019 general election campaign, to ask if Stephenson's company, Hanbury Strategy, could carry out the work in March last year. As part of the polling contract, the company examined public attitudes to Starmer and London mayor Sadiq Khan. One proposal under discussion at the time was to hold joint press conferences with Johnson and Starmer, against the backdrop of concerns about compliance with lockdown, in particular among members of the public who mistrusted the Conservatives. The plan was rejected by Downing Street before it had even been mooted with Starmer's team, but Labour argues that by testing the public's attitude to the Labour leader and Khan, Hanbury was carrying out political work, which should never have been funded with taxpayers' money. Hanbury had previously been brought in to sift potential candidates to be special advisers in Johnson's government. Rayner has called on Case to investigate whether Johnson or cabinet office minister Michael Gove, the former chair of Vote Leave, were involved in awarding the contract – and whether other sums of public money were spent on political activities. The contract with Hanbury, to conduct opinion polls on the public's view of the government's Covid response, is subject to a legal challenge by the Good Law Project (GLP), which argues that it shows "apparent bias". Documents made public at a court hearing last Friday included an email sent on 20 March 2020, in which Cummings asked the most senior civil servant responsible for contracts to sign off the budget immediately, and that if "anybody in CABOFF [the Cabinet Office] whines", to tell them Cummings had "ordered it" from the prime minister. The Cabinet Office, which is defending the GLP's challenge, has insisted it acted lawfully, and that the polling was used to shape public health messaging at a critical time in the pandemic. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: "We do not carry out party political polling." They added that an independent review of cabinet office procurement had already been carried out last December by Nigel Boardman. A Hanbury spokesperson said the company agreed to do the work "at extremely short notice" although it involved reputational risk. They said: "Our work contributed to what was a hugely successful public health communications campaign which undoubtedly prevented many deaths. For that reason, if we had to make the choice again we would still agree to step up and help in this time of crisis."
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour MPs who have campaigned hard for Kim Leadbeater in Batley and Spen over recent days say her narrow 323 vote victory in Thursday's byelection is very much hers. A committed local activist who has worked to bring her local community together since her MP sister, Jo Cox, was murdered there by extremists in 2016, she dealt calmly and resolutely with the rigours of a nasty campaign.  Indeed, party strategists believe it was partly the public's revulsion at unsettling images of Leadbeater being heckled that helped bring voters out to support her, even from traditionally Conservative areas of the seat. Even on Thursday, Labour MPs contacted by the Guardian as they poured into Batley for a get-out-the vote drive in the sunshine remained pessimistic, so her narrow victory came as a sweet relief. Had Leadbeater lost, however, such is the brutal nature of Westminster politics that it would have been read by many backbench MPs not as her personal defeat, but Keir Starmer's. The Labour leader has come under consistent friendly fire in recent weeks for failing to offer a convincingly clear message about what the party stands for, or to narrow Boris Johnson's poll lead despite a string of revelations about sleaze. Many MPs have privately been offering gloomy prognostications in recent days about the dire state of their party, and some were preparing to urge colleagues to launch a leadership challenge. There were even suggestions Labour could come third, behind George Galloway – way wide of the mark in the event, since Leadbeater took 13,296 votes, her Conservative rival Ryan Stephenson 12,973 and Galloway 8,264. So febrile was the mood in recent days that even Starmer's deputy, Angela Rayner, was being mooted as a candidate, and was forced to deny any knowledge of plans for a leadership bid on Thursday – though she did not quite rule out launching one. Rayner was regarded by many on the left of the party as the only person likely to win over the 40 MPs necessary to launch a bid; but there were also ominous rumblings from more centrist MPs about how long Starmer could viably last had Labour lost Batley and Spen. All that chatter will now stop abruptly, at least for the time being. MPs and party members are likely to feel Starmer has earned himself the benefit of the doubt – though his new leadership team know he has a hard road ahead to Labour's autumn conference. Leadbeater's narrow victory, turning the seat into a super-marginal, suggests the electoral tide may still be moving against Labour – Tracy Brabin's majority in the 2019 general election was more than 3,500. The fact that Galloway was able to convince 8,000 voters to support him by playing on Starmer's alleged neglect of the Muslim community is also likely to stoke fears that Labour is alienating once-loyal groups of voters. But Starmer now has a clear run to get on with what he has been promising his party, and all the more reason to energise the minds of potential leadership contenders.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  "What could be described as the ultimate insult to the Labour party by Donald Javid – along party lines – was not only did he say Goodbye but also he called the prime minister a "woke, ill-informed and irresponsible senior citizen".  By contrast, Johnson went out of his way to stress that the UK is "not remotely a corrupt country", that "we are actually a more responsible, more responsible government than you people think". And on other issues, the prime minister went back on his word. After the Gulf crisis, when he wrongly accused the US of being behind the manufacture of the Covid vaccines, Johnson claimed the situation in the Middle East was "bit by bit" – pointing to the fact that the US and UK have been supplying the EU with HLA for months. The EU, which supplies most of the EU's supplies, has repeatedly been criticised for failing to provide the required HLA. The new UK government has announced that no new restrictions will be put in place for 2019-20, including the threat of tax increases on the state-owned sector.  The personal exemption is intended to allow wealthy Americans to live locally and get on top of the tax struggle. It has been drawn up with detailed input from Neil Tweedie, formerly the prime minister's levelling-up adviser, who has written a long-awaited account of how the levelling-up revolution was started. It is expected to be the most detailed analysis of how the policy contributed to the UK's position in the world of bilateral relations since the Good Friday/Belfast agreement. The policy was drawn up with the advice of the former Conservative cabinet minister Michael Gove, who is on trial for his role in the botched rescue of Yorkshire dog Drogheda moorhead farmer David Ross from a deep freeze in May. There have already been some changes, including the return of the rule of six for hospitality venues and table service only. But the most significant departure from the policy was the announcement that the government hoped to use the next general election to legislate to make "soft Conservative" seats more attractive to the Tories. This release confirmed that the Conservatives had been voted down the most popular seats in their own right, with the Leadsom and Sunderland results published on Wednesday. Both elections were held on Wednesday, and represented a three-way tie between the Liberal Democrats and the party of former Conservative mayors. The Lib Dems were celebrating like mad as everything went sideways in the early hours of the morning. They had been clinging doggedly to their promise to "level up" the Conservative party, even as the spectacle of Batley and Spen breaking out into the lobby were making their ranks water. After the defeat, some MPs began to wonder if the decision to keep Boris Johnson's number two was only a matter of "turning points for the party" and "getting things done". The Lib Dems believe the headlines over the past week have helped them to understand how badly they had failed to root for their candidate, even before the Tories' celebrated new MP, Rachel Reeves, stepped in to defend Boris Johnson's handling of the crisis.  After the Batley result, Johnson's spokesperson have frequently insisted, the party has "not changed a thing". They may well have changed their minds after the shock of the tragic loss of life on Wednesday, but the party has not yet been put in place to respond to the loss of life from a care worker's perspective. While the government has been notably mum about the policy of linking the increase in national insurance contributions (NICs) with the NICs rise, its own data suggests the public support a tax on benefit use to help pay for the NHS rollout. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, was last on Wednesday: "We are not looking to tax people for using the NHS; we are looking to tax them to pay for it," he said. That would be a laughable move by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who has already been shown to be irked by the US president, Joe Biden, who called the NICs rise "dramatically problematic". And it is unclear whether Boris Johnson will be able to accept that he is, in effect, cutting government to pay. Certainly, his manner at times appeared to be influenced by the mood of the parliamentary party. After the Batley result, Johnson's spokesperson repeatedly asked the public to "stay at home, protect the NHS and help the police and firewalls". The prime minister appeared to be even more lax in making public health announcements, devoting much of his press conference on Wednesday to discussing the "challenges" of the pandemic and claiming there were "no plans" for a planned shake-up of the cabinet.  Once you've won the argument, you can move on to the next stage – which is likely to involve replacing ministers with blank slots. The former permanent members of the cabinet, who often play a role in cabinet reshuffling, are frequently asked about their memories of Dominic Cummings'
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Boris Johnson has said "we truly did everything we could" to minimise loss of life from coronavirus, and insisted he takes "full responsibility" for the government's handling of the pandemic. Speaking as he set out the government's response to the wake of the Euro 2020 result at the weekend, the prime minister said he had taken "full responsibility" for the government's handling of the pandemic.  "Taking full responsibility for your own handling of the pandemic is the single greatest responsibility in the world, and it was solely my take and my judgment as a responsible government, that there is no going back", he said. Challenged about a dip in Labour's membership, Johnson said: "I think it is important, actually, that we don't fall into that pit of self-loathing that so many of us have been clinging to throughout this crisis." Johnson was speaking as he hailed the performance of his Labour predecessor, saying he had not been surprised by the level of interest he had been offered. "You were obviously not a typical Westminster worker, you've probably spent enough time in the workplace you know, that you've had some of the most distinguished careers to go by your own standards as a responsible, up-to-date, up-make of the country," he said. "And I think most people in this country want a career in public health." Asked if he thought the health secretary was "hopeless," he said: "I don't think so." Pressed on whether he was suggesting a homeless family in bed and breakfast accommodation could afford a visit, he said: "I don't think so." He added: "Could we use your help? Perhaps. Perhaps not so readily. We live in a rapidly developing economy and we need to make sure that we're providing the best for everyone." Pressed on whether he was suggesting a homeless family in bed and breakfast accommodation could afford a visit, he said: "I would say, yes." He added: "We need to make sure that we're providing the best for everyone." The health secretary, Sajid Javid, rejected suggestions that the Conservatives had been unfair in the way they have been treated. "We are entirely entitled to our personal views about the matter and, in all likelihood, we would have preferred that," he said. He added: "I am, by law, solely responsible for making sure that process is in place and, therefore, the legislation that is being used is legislation I can agree with." Johnson was speaking at a Downing Street press conference alongside the prime minister and the health secretary, Sajid Javid. The prime minister and the health secretary have been ringing round potential Tory rebels in an attempt to shed light on what appears to be Conservative political strategy after the party's crushing general election defeat in 2019. The rebels included the former cabinet ministers John Whittingdale and David Cameron, who all backed Leave, as well as the former Labour chancellor, Anneliese Dodds.  Some Brexiters, including the former remainer Dominic Raab, see the potential for a leaner, more centrist approach in a tough May's questions. "She's going to be much more visible about the fact that she thinks it's OK to be haters than to be skeptics," said one. "The big problem with the narrative right now is that it basically is, and it was Was an Agreement for a Different Climate, and It Compromised Our World." One former cabinet minister, who campaigned in 2019 on a more "levelling up" agenda, said the Tories had become complacent. "They've lost the culture war, and it's about, 'What is the deal with this new political party, Donald?' And then when it's over, it's over, and they can say, 'Enough is enough,' and then get on with their lives," he said. "It doesn't feel very Brexit-like, because it was about taking what they got, and putting it on to the next planet. It's about taking what they got – and that is something that I think is very clear about what we believe."
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Boris Johnson has said "we truly did everything we could" to minimise loss of life from coronavirus, and insisted he takes "full responsibility" for the government's handling of the pandemic. But when an inquiry is eventually carried out into the past 12 torrid months, the prime minister will have to face a series of difficult questions about key decisions he made.  As news first began to trickle out of China, triggering the government's pandemic planning, the prime minister left the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to chair the first five meetings of the emergency Cobra committee about the virus. After carrying out a fraught reshuffle of his cabinet, Johnson decamped to the taxpayer-owned mansion of Chevening, and did not chair his first Covid Cobra meeting until 2 March, just before the first confirmed UK death from the virus. Comforted by advisers who compared the challenge to tackling seasonal flu, he tended to play down the seriousness of the pandemic in its early days, insisting it was "business as usual". Most memorably, he told a Downing Street briefing that he "shook hands with everybody" during a hospital visit in early March. With the support of scientific advisers, Johnson took the decision to lift border restrictions on 13 March last year after evidence emerged that the virus was already circulating in the UK, despite a strict quarantine regime for arrivals from Wuhan, in China. At the time, the harsher approach adopted early on by countries such as Singapore and New Zealand, involving flight bans and quarantine, were regarded as extreme by ministers. But many analysts now believe closing the borders was an important precaution that helped these countries and others fare much better. Johnson announced a full-blown lockdown on 23 March last year, with little idea at the time that it would remain in place until July, with many children kept out of the classroom until September. He had edged towards the shutdown via a series of intermediate steps, including banning mass public events and exhorting the public to avoid unnecessary social interaction and to work from home where possible. Only when modelling carried out by Prof Neil Ferguson at Imperial College London suggested there could be up to 500,000 deaths if the virus was not brought under control, and amid growing signs that the public were taking matters into their own hands, did Johnson order the public to stay at home. Some public health experts now believe an earlier shutdown could have saved many thousands of lives. When it emerged that his top adviser had flouted lockdown rules by driving 300-plus miles to Durham, with a day trip to a local town thrown in, Johnson stuck by him resolutely. He told the public at a Downing Street press conference that his aide had acted "responsibly and legally", in crisscrossing the country, ostensibly to seek childcare for his young son, and then to test his eyesight, at a time when the public were being urged to stay at home. His decision sparked an avalanche of angry emails to MPs and risked undermining public confidence in lockdown rules at a critical time. The former TalkTalk executive Dido Harding was brought in by Johnson and Matt Hancock to run the hugely costly test-and-trace system, which has relied heavily on private sector outsourcing and has not worked as effectively as hoped. Councils carrying out their own local contact-tracing operations have generally obtained better results than the call centres run by Serco and other providers, while management consultants have in some cases been paid £7,000 a day for their expertise in setting it up. Johnson and his chancellor, Rishi Sunak, have declined to fix holes in the social safety net – including the paucity of statutory sick pay – that have created a strong financial disincentive for many people to self-isolate. Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance gave the prime minister a briefing on 16 September setting out the dire risks of allowing the virus to run unchecked as cases increased into the autumn. Their colleagues on the Sage committee suggested a short "circuit-breaker" lockdown, perhaps over the October half-term. But Downing Street aides made clear at the time that Johnson considered it to be his role to weigh up scientific advice with other considerations, including the economic and social costs of a fresh lockdown. He therefore opted for a middle course, between the scientists' proposal and the demands of many in his party to resist fresh restrictions: a beefed-up system of "tiers", with tougher rules for the hardest-hit areas. In the event, as Whitty predicted when they were introduced, even the strictest, tier 3 rules did not do enough to restrain the virus, and a month-long lockdown was announced on 31 October. A month before Christmas, the government agreed a plan with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland administrations that would allow up to three households to mix for a fixed five days over the festive period. Johnson then stuck resolutely by the plan, even as cases surged in London and Kent. Matt Hancock alerted the House of Commons to concerns about a new variant of the virus on 14 December,

<|startofarticle|>  Sajid Javid has said he was racially abused almost every day at school when he was growing up. The health secretary was asked about allegations that he has raged about a former friend for years, including openly admitting to filming himself in a hospital gown. Javid said: "I've got nothing against Andrew [Covid] or for Dominic Cummings or for anyone who wants to smear Andrew: that's the job of the Labour party – that's democracy." He added: "The only thing is, I was raised by a very nice, nice, healthy, happy, family man. I'm perfectly capable of handling myself and I'm not going to lie to you." He was replaced by Rachel Reeves last month, when the now sacked Sam White was the shadow chancellor.  Other changes include bringing the newsreader Jonathan Evans out of the creaking phones; shifting the focus from the parliament to making health and care more central to the prime minister's agenda; and cutting the number of people saying they are getting pressure from colleagues to take more urgent action. The decision to remove her as health secretary was not self-inflicted; but friends say it hasogrushed her into more vulnerable territory. When the latest death toll from the virus hit political figures on Wednesday, she was among the 40,000 who could be contacted to call on the prime minister to cancel Christmas, as ministers scramble to contain the worst of the pandemic. The prime minister issued a statement defending the "vast majority" of the deaths in a recent interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme. "He said that,'somebody' might have to be in hospital more heavily,' meaning that they might already be suffering from severe illness or just weren't very well prepared," he said. The prime minister's former chief adviser Dominic Cummings claimed on Twitter on Friday that the government were simply making it harder for local people to come forward and report cases of coronavirus. "Please, do not now, instead of future," Cummings tweeted. Another, more recent, attack on "favourites" – those who have already died – on Saturday morning. "Please, if you have any interest in receiving the Covid vaccine, fill out the form below. It will be used to access the testing platform once we have the data we want," the prime minister said. The form of data would then be used to establish whether patients already in quarantine can show they have been vaccinated, and whether children already in school or injured can prove more challenging parts of their lives. The criteria for the criteria for admission to the Vaccine and Immunisation Group (Vag) were agreed by the government in a five-point plan published last week. These were intended to allow the government to plan for the future through a more systematic approach, rather than relying on ad hoc proposals.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Boris Johnson has promised MPs that schools will be first to reopen when the lockdown is lifted – but stressed he would be "extremely cautious" about when that can happen. The Commons has been recalled to discuss the regulations needed to reimpose the England-wide lockdown announced by the prime minister on Monday.  Addressing MPs on Wednesday, Johnson defended his last-minute decision to close schools, after pupils in many parts of the country returned for a day, saying he had been battling to keep schools open. "Schools were the very last thing to close, as I'd always promised that they would be," he said, adding: "When we begin to move out of lockdown, I promise that they will be the very first things to reopen." "That moment may come after the February half-term, although we should remain extremely cautious about the timetable ahead." The prime minister also sounded a warning to businesses in sectors such as hospitality keen to know when they can reopen, saying the new regulations do not expire until the end of March, because unwinding the lockdown would be a gradual process. "As was the case last spring, our emergence from the lockdown will not be a big bang but a gradual unravelling," he said. He defended the government's handling of the pandemic in recent weeks, claiming the approach of tiered restrictions across England was working until the new variant of Covid became widespread. "The tiers which the house agreed last month were working with the old variant," he said, adding: "It is inescapable that the facts are changing and we must change our response. We have no choice." He added: "The data showed that our efforts to contain the spread of new variant would not be sufficient if schools continued to act as a potential vector for spreading the virus between households." Johnson sought to highlight the potential for rapid delivery of the Covid vaccine as the way out of the crisis, calling it a "sprint", compared with the "marathon" of last year's lockdown. He reiterated that "by 15 February the NHS is committed to offering a vaccine to everyone in the top four priority groups". That includes all over-70s, care home workers and frontline NHS workers. "In working towards that target, there are already more than 1,000 vaccination centres across the country," he said. The prime minister said that from next week there would be seven large-scale new vaccination centres in venues such as sports stadiums and exhibition spaces. He said the UK had already vaccinated 1.3 million people, saying that was more than in the rest of Europe combined, and promised a daily update on the number of people receiving the jab. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said his party would support the lockdown measures but criticised the speed of Johnson's response. "Tougher restrictions are necessary," he said. "We will support them, and vote for them, and urge everybody to comply with the new rules – stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives." But Starmer said the lockdown was "not inevitable", but "part of a pattern", saying the government had been too slow to act throughout the crisis: including failing to heed an official report in the summer called "preparing for a challenging winter", which warned of the risk of the virus mutating and the NHS being overwhelmed during the winter. During the debate, few Conservative MPs challenged the necessity of the lockdown outright. Graham Brady, the chair of the backbench 1922 Committee, called for the Commons to be given more opportunities to vote on the regulations, at the end of January and February. The MP for New Forest West, Desmond Swayne, highlighted anomalies in the regulations, saying they were "pervaded by a pettifogging malice". Johnson replied, "pettifogging yes, malicious, no". The former health secretary Jeremy Hunt asked about the result of studies on whether Covid vaccines were effective against the new variants. Johnson replied: "There is no reason to think that any new strain of the virus is vaccine resistant." Ian Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader, asked the prime minister to consider closing the UK's borders to all but essential travel.

<|startofarticle|>  Generations ago, when Boris Johnson was head of education at Stonewall and Helen Hayes was his deputy, she would have been known as "the nasty little whore". But this week, with Boris Johnson set to take on a younger role, the dominos have really begun to turn. Nick Thomas-Symonds – shadow education secretary A former barrister and Oxford don, 41-year-old Thomas-Symonds is a genuine Labour intellectual – the author of biographies of Clement Attlee and Nye Bevan, as well as a forthcoming one of Harold Wilson. He represents the Welsh seat of Torfaen, where he grew up, and has been trying to reposition Labour as a strong supporter of the police, and tough on crime. He is moving from his role as shadow home secretary. Cat Smith – no longer on Labour frontbench As Cat Smith said in her resignation letter to Keir Starmer, since becoming MP for Lancaster and Fleetwood in 2015 she has spent all but a few months on the frontbenches. An early supporter of Jeremy Corbyn, she became a junior equalities minister under him just four months after entering parliament. Her loyalty to him was clear when she stood down as shadow cabinet Office minister on Monday, saying in a parting message to Starmer that it was "utterly unsustainable" Corbyn had not been given the party whip.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Last week's budget included a stealth cut to funding for youth services worth more than £400m over the next three years, Labour has claimed. Sajid Javid's government was handed a major blow on Tuesday by the shadow chancellor, Keir Starmer, who said after reports of a cut to the state's share of the proceeds from football fees had caused "blisters" in the social care system.  After initially fearing the social care revenue stream would be shut off by next month, and fearing it would be difficult to rein in the public finances, the chancellor has since cut funding for the social care system to the bare minimum. In a move that provoked furious denunciations from the rightwing party shortly before it was revealed that it had cut social care funding, the chancellor has virtually permanently suspended some social care funding in the budget, anyway. That is, until it was announced that social care would now be increasing its handbook of specialises in the disease and other conditions, known as the "red wall".  That will certainly help the public health services – but they will be left unscathed by a £285m cut in the goblemeister budget next month. In prereleased remarks, Javid said: "When we talk about turning the welfare state into a political party, we are really only going to that extent because we are fundamentally insecure about the political roots of this phenomenon. "We have come to that fateful age when we are fundamentally insecure about what we believe, what we provide, and about the political roots of this phenomenon." Red wall advocates have warned that the £20-a-week reduction in the share of the proceeds from food parcels being issued nationwide will cause parents to look beyond their children, and instead look to tackling crime. Johnson's official spokesperson has insisted the proceeds of the tax cut will trickle down to families, pointing out the tens of millions of households will own a home. But Javid's spokesperson conceded that the distribution of the funds evenly among social groups will remain controversial, with some charitable groups keen to see at least £5m a year distributed to their children.
====================
<|startofarticle|> The health secretary has said the government may need to reintroduce mandatory face masks and advise the public to work from home, as he set out the government's plans for coping with Covid in England through the autumn and winter. Sajid Javid told the House of Commons: "Any responsible government must prepare for all eventualities," as he outlined what he called the government's "plan B" in the event that the virus surges.  He conceded that mask-wearing and vaccine passports for crowded venues could be introduced if necessary – as well as "communicating clearly and urgently to the public the need for caution". But he did not mention lockdowns, as he informed the MPs of what he called his "plan A" for managing the virus, "without the need for stringent economic and social restrictions". "We must be vigilant," he told MPs. More details of the government's contingency measures have been set out in a document published alongside Javid's statement, including plans for vaccine passports. The prime minister announced in July that it would be compulsory to prove vaccination status before entering nightclubs and other crowded venues. The government has since backed away from the plan after a backlash from Tory MPs, but Javid confirmed it was being held in reserve. The document says vaccine passports would be applied to all nightclubs; all indoor, crowded settings with 500 or more people such as music venues; all outdoor settings with 4,000 or more people such as festivals; and any venue with 10,000 or more people, such as big sports matches. It acknowledges the plans may need to be implemented at short notice – and encourages businesses to introduce vaccine passports voluntarily. The document also includes advice to the public about how they should behave as winter approaches. They are urged to meet outdoors where possible, keep windows open when meeting indoors, and think twice about activities such as singing or dancing. "In general, the risk of catching or passing on Covid-19 is higher in crowded spaces (where there are more people who might be infectious) and in enclosed indoor spaces (where there is limited fresh air)," the document says. "Some activities, such as singing, dancing and exercising can also increase the risk of transmission of Covid-19 as people are doing activities which generate more particles as they breathe. The risk is greatest where these factors overlap." The public are also cautioned to "wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed settings" – advice taken by very few of the Conservative MPs sitting behind Javid in a busy Commons chamber as he spoke. The government also pointedly refuses to rule out imposing a fresh lockdown. "While the government expects that, with strong engagement from the public and businesses, these contingency measures should be sufficient to reverse a resurgence in autumn or winter, the nature of the virus means it is not possible to give guarantees," the plan says. "The government remains committed to taking whatever action is necessary to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed but more harmful economic and social restrictions would only be considered as a last resort." Plan B would be invoked, the document says, "if the data suggests the NHS is likely to come under unsustainable pressure". Javid said 81% of people over 16 had received two doses of Covid vaccination, and the link between infections, hospitalisation and deaths had been "weakened significantly", so that deaths from the current wave had been "mercifully low". He said the government's plan A included five pillars: renewing efforts to maximise vaccine uptake and expanding it to 12- to 15-year-olds; maintaining the test-and-trace system, including encouraging regular asymptomatic testing; boosting funding for the NHS and social care; encouraging people to modify their behaviour, such as meeting outside; and cooperating with international partners. Javid also confirmed the government would publish a new framework for international travel before the end of this month. Earlier, the government's health advisers announced their recommendation that booster jabs be delivered to the over-50s and younger people with underlying health conditions. Javid confirmed he would take that advice. Children aged between 12 and 15 will also be offered one dose of the Pfizer vaccine, as recommended by the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, and his colleagues. Javid also said it was "highly likely", that vaccination would be made compulsory for frontline NHS workers.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Keir Starmer has appointed well-respected north-east of England MP Sharon Hodgson as his new parliamentary aide, as he seeks to smooth relations with Labour backbenchers after last weekend's fraught reshuffle. Hodgson, the MP for Washington and Sunderland West since 2010, replaces Carolyn Harris, who resigned earlier this week amid claims that she had stoked up tensions between Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner.  As Starmer's parliamentary private secretary, her job will be to liaise between backbenchers and the leader's office. Some MPs have complained in recent weeks that they felt neglected by Starmer's team. Hodgson will also bring understanding of the north-east, where Labour lost the Hartlepool byelection last week, and the Conservatives made fresh inroads in local council elections. Labour announced several other junior appointments on Friday evening, as the Labour leader completed the shakeup that began in the wake of last week's election results. Peter Kyle, the Hove MP, will be the shadow schools minister, after Wes Streeting was handed a new role overseeing Labour's child poverty strategy. Streeting announced on Friday that he will step back from frontline politics for the time being after being diagnosed with kidney cancer. The leftwinger Andy McDonald will have a beefed-up role in Rayner's new team, as shadow secretary of state for employment rights and protections. Seema Malhotra will be shadow business and consumer minister, replacing Lucy Powell, who was promoted last week to be shadow housing secretary. Other changes include a return to the fold for several MPs who had resigned for various reasons. Flo Eshalomi, MP for Vauxhall, who resigned rather than vote for Boris Johnson's Brexit in December, returns as Rayner's new parliamentary private secretary. Olivia Blake, the MP for Sheffield Hallam, who stepped down over Labour's stance on the overseas operations bill, returns as shadow minister for nature. Starmer's plans for overhauling his frontbench last weekend were held up for much of last Sunday by negotiations with Rayner about what role she would be willing to accept. She relinquished the jobs of party chair and national campaign coordinator, and was instead handed the role of shadowing the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, as well as other titles, including shadow secretary of state for the future of work.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  <|startofarticle|> Keir Starmer is in "discussions" about whether to press ahead with radical changes to the way Labour elects its leaders, after pulling plans to put the proposals to a vote at the party's ruling national executive committee (NEC).  The Labour leader had been expected to push the package of reforms at a meeting on Friday evening. But after Johnson withdrew his support, Starmer's office said they had already received assurances from Rayner's office that she would resist being constrained by the whip.  Instead, she will be expected to make the point that the scale of the problem facing the government was "weakened significantly", after the furlough scheme was finally wound down in the autumn, and as a result the finances of the poorest families were in a much better position. "Rayner's and Keir's jobs are to tell the truth about this government and to make the case to the electorate that this is a government that can be proud of its roots and its achievements," said Steve Reed. "They are not to claim to be the party of peace, but to be the party of peace only to find out the hard way that its failings have been deeply ingrained in our country, in the minds of voters, in the way that its failings have been exposed by the way it has been treated." Reed and Starmer both backed the resignation of Afghanistan's then foreign secretary, Adelanto, and the subsequent introduction of Cox, who is now a senator. But Cummings has criticised the way the government has treated his case, with the prime minister reportedly failing to appreciate the seriousness of the situation in the country until late October. Turner, who has since left parliament, has expressed his concerns about the way the government has treated his case. Johnson's spokesperson has insisted the prime minister has "full confidence," in Raab, who was allegedly unceremoniously sacked by the prime minister for leaking state security secrets. Cummings is investigating the very factors that caused the prime minister to fail to grasp the seriousness of the situation in the early part of February, when Cummings' review was first announced. It is expected to be completed before the end of this year. Cummings had previously claimed at one point that the review would be the "finest piece of work" he had ever been offered. The shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, was sent out to shadow the Foreign Office minister, Michael Gove, to work on the implementation of the "framework" for the changes, which were announced last week. But after Cummings withdrew his support, Nandy said she had made a "serious decision" about backing the reforms.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour has called for Boris Johnson to explain the existence of a secretive "advisory board" for wealthy Conservative donors who have received regular access to the prime minister and Rishi Sunak. The Financial Times has learned of at least a dozen Conservative-supporting firms, some with vast donor lists.  Members of parliament's elite Financial Security Group (FSG) are said to have been involved in awarding the club's footballers the access necessary to obtain a licence to play. The Conservative party declined to comment on the case, but Sunak's office confirmed it was involved in some way. Sunak's remarks, made during the festive period, about the "joke" of the coronavirus pandemic making its way through the UK, prompting the prime minister to refer to it as "screaming", were in stark contrast to the caricature of the prime minister as a "renegade", ironed out by his own spokesperson after a string of embarrassing losses.  Nevertheless, the party's coyness about the issue of spending and borrowing undermined some of Johnson's most devoted supporters on Sunday, many of them at the wheel of the world leader, Aboob Deldice, who tended to be highly critical of the Conservatives. As the match was being televised live, the England dug in again under new boss Andy Burnham, with the match televised on Sky Sports at Unite on Tuesday evening. Just three days ago, Johnson's spokesperson conceded that the prime minister's rhetoric in his party conference speech about a "new deal for the people" was "completely false". Meanwhile, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has wasted little time putting the welfare of millions of working people at the fore of the UK's future, and the prime minister's own spokesperson this week conceded that the vast majority of them are either furloughed or on low incomes. "There are clearly the first spots of poverty on the planet but the economy is so dependent on it that there is virtually nobody left to work from," said Steve Reed, a policy fellow at the Lords watchdog, the National Audit Office. "The prime minister's language is that the welfare of the people he is elected to represent is of the highest importance and therefore the best use of his time." The prime minister's official spokesman has repeatedly declined to take a side in the argument between Johnson and Sunak, preferring to play down the significance of the pandemic in all it was important. Yet Sunak has made clear he is concerned about the risk of inflation getting out of control if wages rise without improvements in productivity – from better skills and investment in new technologies, for example. The prime minister's chief adviser, Anneliese Dodds, is concerned that the pace of technological change will make it difficult or impossible for the government to deliver on its promise to "never again" leave the EU. "It's a fact that work is dying out, and as a result there is a huge amount of frustration in the country," she said. "And as a result, both the price of living in insecurity and of being in a position to drive down the incomes of working people is one that is deeply troubling to both the prime minister and to those in the party who are having to relearn what they learned in school," she said. "And it is also a fact that the Conservatives are fundamentallyistic about wanting to move beyond just 'I'm going to do this', " she added. "It is also a fact that the civil service are going to be much more cautious and focused on helping the most vulnerable people in their time of need, and the private sector is going to be much more responsive to the demands of the food sector and the hospitality sector. And it is also a fact that the new schools will be much more bucolic and the indoor mixing platform will be much more widely used," she said. "It's also a fact that the nimble agency that is replacing them has got very, very specific rules and guidelines and they are very aware of the demands on their sector and the specific skillset they are creating, and they are taking the best advice they can get." As a backbencher, Reeves chaired the business select committee's inquiry into the chaotic collapse of the construction firm Carillion, which held more than 400 public sector contracts.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour sources under discussion about a leadership challenge said the winter plan announced by Starmer had not yet been worked over with Corbyn's team. But one party source said: "It's clear Andy Burnham hasn't got the menorah going, he's just got to look over his shoulder at the press." They cited a lack of concrete proposals to demonstrate the impact of the pandemic had not yet been worked out, and the plans had been drawn up in separate structures than in the minds of some colleagues. Meanwhile, the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, has said the government will press ahead with plans to introduce vaccine passports for nightclubs and other crowded indoor venues in England from the end of next month. "The government has pointed out the obvious the team will shift when the mood is high," she said on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, saying that up to 40 bands could be banded, disrupting large-scale socialising sessions. "We'll move into banded mode. The biggest problem is, there are people out there taking things on: loud and clear." The government had already stretched the gap between the two groups, handing out training to new recruits on detecting potential threats to confidentiality. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, is expected to set out further details on Monday of how coronavirus cards, which can show the risk of coronavirus transmission in pubs, will be rolled out over the next month.  But Johnson has made clear the government is confident the rollout can be started within the framework of existing guidance. "We're not in the business of rolling out plans, nor are we planning any plans at this moment," he said. As well as the new requirements for social distancing, there are the usual suspects at the Treasury: the business secretary, Priti Patel; and the chief scientific adviser, Sir Alex Allan, who was invited to some high-profile meetings last week in order to set out the research findings.  But Dodds said Johnson was more than capable of adapting the little he's done than either of them. "I think what I would say is that this prime minister is capable of taking the rough and tumble in order and adapting it over time," she said. And she insisted the research findings do not appear to have been the government's "final plan". "The research is outstanding, the research is clear and the research shows we don't need to cut and run with it." But she conceded that while Brexit was no longer a "last-minute settlement" of the crisis, "we must now be free of cronyism that exploits past mistakes and abuses the past public services to enrich their future profits." Johnson was recently criticised for defying the house of Commons Speaker David Lammy by giving a highly critical speech about the role of the DUP in the peace process. Lammy gave his own take on the debate, writing in the Observer: "The question now troubling politicians all, particularly those with experience in the past pinch, is what happens when the stakes are really high." However, the wider public are being urged to stay at home and won't be ordered to stay at home, Conservative MP Keir Starmer has said as he promised to "reverse the tide of care inflation" after the upsurge in Covid infections he said saw the UK's economy grow by 300,000 jobs. Over the past seven days, the prime minister has reshuffled his team after the departure of the chief whip, Ed Llewellyn, who was made a junior health secretary in the coalition government. But the shake-up was expected to be permanent, with the protectionist ethos of some Johnsonists obstructed by the traditionally hard-left Speaker, Nick Thomas-Symonds.  While some MPs have already been offered seats at the government's autumn and winter plan briefings, few have the stomach for a challenge – and few plans for a spluttering general election. So while the NHS recovery is not yet sure- it may yet be able to hold on to its seats, Johnson and his chancellor may also face a choice: can they continue to ride out the worst of the crisis, or risk a fresh bout of self-isolation for some voters. The former Labour adviser James Meadway has called the 2017 general election potentially forever, and the 2019 manifesto says the "enduring cycle of incompetence" must be followed through on political questions. That could allow a political outsider to steal the show, sucking cash out of voters' sights and wants. It is expected to be hard to counter, however, challengers who have the raw nerve to ask the important questions that have been so captivating for former Labour voters: why are you in politics, and what is wrong with you? And whether the result of the next general election will be hard to miss.

<|startofarticle|>  Keir Starmer has appointed well-respected north-east of England MP Sharon Hodgson as his new parliamentary aide, as he seeks to smooth relations with Labour backbenchers after last weekend's fraught reshuffle. Hodgson, the MP for Washington and Sunderland West since 2010, replaces Carolyn Harris, who resigned earlier this week amid claims that she had stoked up tensions between Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner.  As Starmer's parliamentary private secretary, her job will be to liaise between backbenchers and the leader's office. Some MPs have complained in recent weeks that they felt neglected by Starmer's team. Hodgson will also bring understanding of the north-east, where Labour lost the Hartlepool byelection last week, and the Midlands are said to be concerned about possible cuts to social care as the economy bounces back. The shadow chancellor is keen to underline the case for a trade deal with the UK, and Labour is not backing away from the idea of a trade deal, despite the damaging report about the NCS. "We oppose deals with countries that create conditions for the transmission of diseases, or with barriers to the public health," the statement says. "We call on the UK government to reverse the decision to sign off on Monday for England to become a fully trade EU member. This would mean that No 10 could present its deal card alongside the Brexit deal –' – on several official occasions over the next three months." The health secretary, Sajid Javid, rejected reports on Wednesday that the prime minister had blocked additional funding for social care, pointing out that the NHS was already facing a backlog of backlogs for other social care needs. But he conceded that the government's intention had been clear. "We are concerned about the growth in the challenge we are facing and the challenge that we can continue to face," he said. As well as continuing to attract nurses and increase the number of working-class communities, the expansion of the social care system has given rise to a new class of patients, called the "red wave", which previously has seen the state focused on treating patients with deep problems. It is estimated that red wave patients represent 40% of the NHS population. Hodgson said the state could lose £900m in revenue by the end of the year as the crisis is contained. "We have a new, improved hospital in Walthamstow, and a much better prognosis for the time being," he said. "We are seeing improvement in the rates at which they are moving patients in the right direction. The problem is, the problem is getting worse. The problem is that the problem is happening faster than we anticipated." He added: "This idea that somehow, as a byelection, or some other dramatic way to lose a majority, this is to take a strong stand for fairness, this is achievable by a long period of sustained, principled opposition to all the schemes and approaches that have been tried and rejected over the last 40 years." The opposition parties have been granted two opportunities to respond to the prime minister's statement. The first relates to Keir Starmer's recent speech, in which he referred to the costs of the pandemic as "the road ahead". The second relates to Hilary as "a courier for the rich" and proposes cutting NHS funding to sanctuary. Both of these scenarios would be welcomed by the Tory backbenchers, but unlikely to pass, given the manifesto pledge of £900m for the NHS.

<|startofarticle|>  Jeremy Corbyn has pledged to campaign against the arrival of Rupert Murdoch's News UK television channel as he launched his Peace and Justice Project at an online rally. A more "just, free and accountable" media is one of four causes Corbyn is encouraging his supporters to back. He also urged them to help with organising direct support in communities, such as food banks; campaign for a green new deal; and press the government to speed up the delivery of Covid vaccines in developing countries.  "So many of the ideas we need to make the 2020s better than the 2010s were developed in and around the Labour party in recent years, by outstanding thinkers, but more importantly by demands of our movements, and the skills, knowledge and needs of the communities affected," Corbyn said. "We will build on these policies, taking them further, adapting them to the post-pandemic world, so that our movement can turn the dial towards peace and justice." Corbyn was readmitted to the Labour party in November, after being suspended over remarks he made when the Equality and Human Rights Commission published its critical report on the party's handling of antisemitism. But his successor as leader, Keir Starmer, declined to restore the Labour whip to Corbyn, who now sits as an independent MP. The broadcasting regulator, Ofcom, gave the go-ahead last month to Murdoch's right-leaning news channel, which is expected to be on air for four to five hours a night. It is expected to compete with Andrew Neil's GB News, with the pair racing to be the first on air. Corbyn repeatedly criticised the role of the media in public life during his time as leader of the opposition. He was ridiculed in some of Murdoch's newspapers, with the Sun's front page on election day in 2017 urging its readers: "Don't chuck Britain in the Cor-bin." Corbyn gave a lecture at the Edinburgh television festival in 2018 calling for a taxpayer-owned British Digital Corporation to offset the power of multinational corporations in the media, though the policy never found its way into Labour's manifesto. His digital rally also featured Greece's former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis and the Labour MP for Coventry South, Zarah Sultana. The new initiative will not be signing up members but Corbyn hopes to play a convening role in bringing together activists, trade unions and other leftwing groups. Setting out the aims of his new political venture, he appeared to take a sideswipe at his successor, saying: "If you refuse to argue for your side, our opponents win by default." Some of Corbyn's allies believe Starmer has not been sufficiently robust in attacking Boris Johnson's government – and fear backsliding from some of the radical policies set out in the 2019 general election manifesto. Starmer has adopted the slogan "a new leadership" to differentiate his tenure from Corbyn's four-and-a-half-year period at the top of the party.

<|startofarticle|>  Keir Starmer has appointed well-respected north of England MP Sharon Hodgson as his new parliamentary aide, as he seeks to smooth relations with Labour backbenchers after last weekend's fraught reshuffle. Hodgson, the MP for Washington and Sunderland West since 2010, replaces Carolyn Harris, who was promoted last week to be Johnson's new frontbench aide. She will take on a frontbench role, underlining the importance of a woman in the Speaker's Office, and she was involved in developing the messaging during the Johnson years. As well as being involved in the reshuffle of the backbench units, Hodgson was a past president of the National Union of Mineworkers (Nup) and a former shadow trade secretary. She was born in Derby and went to school in nearby Belper before taking a degree in sociology and a masters in women's studies at Loughborough University. She has a long history of working-class pride. In a recent tweet announcing her appointment, she said: "Since Rebecca Long-Bailey was elected Leader of the Labour party last week has been a guide to every decision made by the new Leader of the Labour party. She is entirely focused on making Labour look like the Conservatives, and she will do that by ensuring she and the Corbynite party look like the Conservatives." She added: "This is a new start. The frontbenchers who have supported me throughout this crisis need to be held to account for their decision-making process. Jeremy Corbyn and the leadership need to be carefully maneuvered around this new normal."

====================
<|startofarticle|>  Tony Blair has said the day-jobs minister, Mahel Sunnysh, has decided to step down from parliament, "as the best decision I can make making sure that our best day-jobs workers are granted the rights and protections they need, while delivering a Labour government". Asked whether he would consider resigning from parliament, he said: "Yes, mahel. The reason I said resigning is that the reason I am not doing is because of legislation we passed last week. It was passed after a period of relative calm. We talked about trying to get the best deal for our country. We talked about making sure that wasn't achieved by taking our eyes off the ball." Campbell quietly negotiated a new deal for Northern Ireland that included a guarantee that workers would be granted real-terms benefits that began to trickle down to former Labour-supporting industries. The new Typhoons deal, which will operate through 21 June, also promises to see a closer collaboration between the state and private sector, aimed at preventing the UK falling into the worst of the worst outrages over Brexit. While the Tories have been able to portray Corbyn as the candidate of opportunity, Blair repeatedly pointed out that the Tories have focused on two voters, the young party activists who have flooded into Labour-held seats to back Jeremy Corbyn over the Labour crisis. Starmer's team hope the first in-person conference since he was elected leader will be a chance to showcase the qualities that Blair so passionately describes – vision, experience and energy. But the conference will also mark a shift in the emphasis the party has taken on workers' rights. In a recent speech, Blair called on the government to treat all workers properly, including during the Brexit transition period. Tony Blair was scathing about the Tories for failing to act on workers' rights during the Jeremy Corbyn era, calling them "the party of workers".  But Blair also called on the Labour party to build on its reputation for civil liberties, by highlighting the fact that John Major was able to persuade the House of Commons to keep him on as culture secretary. As well as workers' rights, the conference will also be a gathering point for right-wing speakers to launch coordinated attacks on the government. One of Blair's first interventions will be on the Corbynite campaign group Momentum. Being the first MP to be elected in aas, Blair will be one of the few former MPs to be present for Corbyn's events. Speakers from across the Labour party will be urgently required to conference rules, so that they can hold public appearances and have to bestage at key moments during the conference. Blair was the first MP to be elected to the House of Commons in 2015, becoming a minister in the shadow cabinet under him as the result of a long-running leadership challenge. He was voted the party's leader twice in the year 2020, both in the seat made vacant by the death of his predecessor, Robert Buckland. Both victories followed a general election when Blair was voted into parliament as an independent MP. Cooper won easily in the 2019 general election, but Biden's (Sport for Britain) sports shoe business was among the policies Labour set out at the 2019 conference on human rights. 2030 was also a particularly turbulent decade for the Labour party, with the murder of Jo Cox, by extremists in the ranks of the party, and the continuing loss of the Hartlepool byelection. The killing of Jo Cox by a lone attacker weakened the image of the Conservatives as the party of "freedom fighters", allowing the Tories to seize the moment for their electoral gains with a rare political victory. However, the party's relationship with the police has been raised by senior figures within the party, who have warned that it is ill-suited to deal with the surge in serious cases brought to the party by the Covid crisis. Starmer has been acutely conscious in recent weeks that the Labour party is vulnerable to potential defeat in Hartlepool, as the Omicron wave sets in. The Lib Dems are also likely to raise questions about their ability to hold on to the seat with which they were already in a position, with the Lib Dems having made it a party whip, so far this year. The Batley and Spen byelection is being contested with a high turnout and the appointment of a local party chair, all but guaranteeing defeat unless Labour puts forward a viable candidate. The Tories are expected to draw attention to their lax approach to ethics in public life – including meeting set hours, not obeying lockdown rules and testing positive for Covid. The last time a sitting MP was called to answer to a member of staff – usually a member of staff – the committee wrote the entire thing off.

<|startofarticle|>  Keir Starmer has opted to make tackling antisocial behaviour a top priority, announcing the government would aim to "level up" antisocial behaviour to "priceless level". "In the north we have the hard choices to make," he said, adding: "This is a great moment to show that we have an ambitious and sensible approach to green finance." He defended the government's handling of the antisocial behaviour row, saying: "As a minister I can promise you that if we work with the antisocial towards the best use of the money that is coming our way." The row with Pfizer began when Johnson was culture secretary and went into cabinet as the chief executive of Pfizer. The then chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, objected to the idea of a daily routine across the government by week's end, when many MPs were getting their first taste of the new summer.  When the substance found its way into the public consciousness on Tuesday, the prime minister claimed the news was "like a bomb had been dropped on him by anemone". But Javid has since asserted himself, having promised to "mobilise" the government's policymaking capacity. Johnson's official spokesperson has frequently appeared in the past with the self-inflicted wound of the Covid crisis, having helped repair the communications system that underpins the government's thinking these days. He could be particularly vulnerable to the Tories' claim that he is "missing in action". The former permanent secretary to the Treasury Nick Macpherson told Times Radio on Sunday: "Whether you like it or not you can't rely on me to fill in the blanks." Turnout in the byelection is only just over, and the Lib Dems are in a strong position at the top of the poll, bolstered by the addition of the former MP Steve Baker. There has been speculation that Labour could emerge from the byelection defeat completely unceded, with some MPs quietly casting around for a candidate who could gather the 40 signatures necessary to mount a challenge. But Javid's team said he has made no commitment to backing a leadership challenge, preferring to stress that the party is "fighting for every vote".

<|startofarticle|> Ministers are investigating the use of "Covid status certificates" to help allow society to reopen, Boris Johnson's spokesperson said on Friday. The prime minister had previously been criticised for deciding to "cancel Christmas" in recent weeks, before sharing the Christmas tree with his new wife.  Instead of tearing up the existing system, the prime minister could have opted for a lateral flow test, which could have led to many queues at busy tube and train stations. Instead, the prime minister used a televised statement to announce that a "Covid reopening" plan, drawn up under the auspices of its authors, would be scrapped. Ministers had previously been criticised for failing to make a significant investment in the programme, before the costly rollout was necessitated by the furlough scheme. The new video, featuring the health secretary, Matt Hancock, announcing the reopening of the economy, suggested the government could have saved £560m by cutting waiting lists. The health secretary, a committed Covid sufferer, said: "The numbers that we are seeing at the moment are fully in line with what we had planned." He added: "Thanks to the hard work that's been shown by people who have got vaccinated, we are on the right path." The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said the announcement was a "bitter blow for working class families and a grave misstep towards further cuts to our public services".

<|startofarticle|>  Generations ago, when the world's leaders faced off over the Northern Ireland protocol, the world's leaders introduced the following protocol into parliament. It was then that Frankenstein's monster began to go mad.  As the protocol was being developed, MPs discovered their colleagues had voted to make it a third wave, which they called the "naturally occurring children's book".  As the years went on, however, the name became increasingly and alarmingly familiar, and the Child Protective Services Association (CPSA) became increasingly concerned about the dangers of exposure to the virus. As one government source put it: "The helpline is: 'Forward, forward, get this over with. The helpline is working.' And the responses from frontline communities have been absolutely incredible. The sheer number of visits a day, the amazing resilience of the staff, the incredible resources at our disposal – it's incredible." Another senior government source said: "It's called the 'quad' of a protocol, and it encompasses a wide range of issues, from protection of the confidentiality of referrals, to the urgent need for care homes to check up on the huge number of children being cared for." Asked how many calls had been made in relation to the Northern Ireland protocol, a Whitehall spokesperson said: "We document all sorts of things, including issues of international cooperation, on humanitarian grounds." Asked whether the UK had taken any immediate action, a spokesperson said: "We are committed to uniting and making Europe work for Britain. We are not in a position to comment on the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol when the protocol is still in place," he said.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, has said her own experience as a care worker helped to convince her more flexible working could be a "win-win" for staff and employers. Speaking to the Guardian after announcing new policies last week on employment rights and flexible conditions, Rayner said she had helped negotiate family-friendly working when she was a trade union representative.  "We were frontline manual workers, delivering 7am till 10pm care in people's homes. We introduced a flexible rota that worked for the staff, and we saw productivity go up. The wellbeing of the staff, as well as the outcome for the service user, was they had the same staff going in – and sickness levels went significantly down as well, so it saved money for the employer. It's a win-win," she said. "Of course, not everything can be achieved in every single workplace, but there are flexible options I believe in every workplace. If an employer looks after the employees, the employees will look after the employer, and it's reciprocal," she added. Rayner announced this week that a Labour government would legislate to give companies an obligation to provide flexible conditions – including compressed hours, and accommodating caring responsibilities such as the school run – unless they can show it is unworkable. It was part of a package of measures, drawn up with the shadow workers' rights minister, Andy McDonald, that also included ensuring all employees gain rights from day one in a job. The plans have been welcomed by the Corbynite campaign group Momentum, and helped to assuage fears among some in the party that Starmer would ditch the radical 2019 manifesto wholesale. Speaking after a visit to a flexible working hub in Hull, Rayner said Labour's aim was nothing less than to achieve a "cultural shift" in the workplace. "It's about changing the culture in our country. The whole emphasis to me is, yes there's individual nuggets in here, but it's about a cultural shift away from people being inflexible, and not looking for new and fresh ideas about how people can engage in the workplace," she said. Rayner shrugged off suggestions that she has been at loggerheads with Keir Starmer – or could even challenge him for the leadership, as some supporters had urged her to do before the Batley and Spen byelection earlier this month. "Me and Keir have been working incredibly closely together since the start of the pandemic," she said, comparing the day when they were both elected in the depths of the first lockdown to "an arranged marriage, almost, by telephone". "We bring different things to that leadership. And I think that works," she said, calling them "yin and yang". Labour's loss of the Hartlepool constituency in May sparked panic about Starmer's prospects of leading Labour to another general election, with some MPs quietly casting around for a candidate who could gather the 40 signatures necessary to mount a challenge. But his leadership has appeared more secure since the party held the Yorkshire seat of Batley and Spen. Rayner said she and Starmer had different approaches. "You know, my style is more robust as people know: I'm more bombastic, in the way in which do things, I say it how I see it: and therefore I bring that freshness to the partnership." "Keir's very forensic, he's very intelligent. He's very passionate about making sure that the country is a better place," she said. Rayner has spoken in the past about growing up in poverty, and becoming a carer for her mother, who struggled with mental illness, from the age of 10. "I like to think I overshare and Keir undershares," she said. "If you look at Keir's background, it's not dissimilar for mine: he looked after his mum, I looked after my mum," she says. "Keir wasn't from a privileged background". Challenged about a dip in Labour's membership, Rayner said she was focused on voters. "Of course we want to attract people to be members of the Labour party, but what we need to do is we need to attract voters as well. And what we're doing is we're speaking to the country: we're saying that actually we don't want to be an opposition, we want to be a government," she said. Labour is in the process of laying off up to 90 staff via voluntary redundancies, as Starmer seeks to repair the party's shattered finances after costly election battles and a string of legal cases. The former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott criticised Labour this week for simultaneously seeking to hire staff on six-month contracts to handle a backlog of complaints against members. "So Keir will make Britain the best place to work – unless you work for Labour," Abbott tweeted. Rayner rejected that, highlighting the importance of ensuring the party is financially viable. "We don't want to be making staff redundant. It's an awful situation but we
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Rutger than likely to win a leadership challenge, Angela Rayner's allies are urging Starmer to slim down the party's worst misstep yet, ahead of the party's winter conference in Brighton. Rayner, the shadow secretary of state for the future of work as well as Starmer's number two, has been under pressure to play down the party's failings, despite the party having been consistently sacked by the publicneumonia vaccination campaign group Spectra.  "Angela Rayner is obviously the worst offender. She seems to have been signalling to people in government that she thinks it's OK to leak documents, because they show that you support the Labour party," said one senior Tory. "What is particularly striking about this individual is that in order for arouse people to believe that he or she is against the leak, but instead, they are in agreement that it's called whistleblowing – and that it shows that the Labour party is seriously about changing."
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Boris Johnson has said "we truly did everything we could" to minimise loss of life from coronavirus, and insisted he takes "full responsibility" for the government's handling of the pandemic. Asked about the national insurance contributions (NICs) issue, in which the government has admitted to cutting them by more than a third, the prime minister said he looked forward to the debate in the House of Commons "in the morning and then overnight".  "When the NICs are coming in, they will be gone by noon, but we will be in a very, very difficult position," he said, adding: "There are ways of dealing with this problem, ways of dealing with the surge in infections, ways of dealing with the shutdown of the NHS – and I think that will be much easier said than done." He was speaking as he prepared to fly back to London after delivering a party conference speech setting out Labour's stall for the future. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, has confirmed a one in five increase in the NICs increase over the next two months will be experienced by young people. The prime minister said that among young people aged 16-29, the NICs rise are "quite high", at £2.19 an dose. The increase is so high that "I think half my friends are having to cancel their appointments right now, because they haven't got the funds to cover the costs of getting into work." He added: "So this is why I think the next step must be to increase the investment we're making in technology to help us to deal with this surge in infections." The health secretary, who is also the chief executive of NHS England, welcomed the announcement on Friday. "This is a great step, this new start for us as we prepare to get on with the world we want," he said. He said it would be "premature" to call the increase "a problem" and said the health secretary could decide to increase the age at which people can switch off from the virus. Johnson praised the concept of "advice deserts", in which low-income people can participate in a month of "learning by doing" a week later. The idea was examined by the independent Council on Foreign Relations but did not appear to be a priority for the government. Instead, they are hoping that the experience of other nations, and the skillset developed over the past two years, will help them to better understand how the virus is spread and what to do when they inevitably run out of control. The government is also looking at how it can increase the number of well-paid, temporary foreign workers who can take the virus more safely. It is expected to publish a breakdown of each position as it goes along. The idea of "hubs" – those who can be transferred between households – was examined more closely in 2020 and 2021, but nothing has been implemented yet. The hope is that by allowing more low-income people to move back into settled families, and by boosting the effectiveness of social security, the idea of "hubs" may help to address the perception that many care home residents are habitually evasive and uncooperative in the face of difficult choices. The prime minister is expected to make more changes over the next few weeks.
====================
<|startofarticle|> Angela Rayner has been demoted from shadow minister of state for women and equalities to Tom Watson, a Labour source has said. Rayner, who was a shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was among the early critics of Corbyn's leadership when she was readmitted to the party in November. She was among the early arrivals into the role who had been kept informed of the decision, who had tweeted about their surprise election successes and expressed concerns about the way the Corbyn era was being run. "Angela Rayner was awesome," said one insider. "She played a big part in giving us this terrible, messianic character trait, which has led us to regard her as an embarrassment. She played by the same rules as everyone else: taking questions, making excuses for why there was not a response, refusing to listen to questions. Even when there was, they turned their fire on her. That became even more evident when we were pastebin-ing her.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Joe Biden has said the UK and Australia have a "big problem" of the day when we are not only "having too much too fast", as the UK's costly Covid response has undermined public confidence in the western civilisation. The prime minister was asked about the prospects of a deal as Biden spoke by video link at the Eden Project, where he is hosting the G7 summit. He said: "We're having a really rough patch. We can't afford to be having these things at this very moment." Biden highlighted the fact that the UK had already suspended the use of Covid vaccines in some cases, despite the government's warnings. He said the government's thinking was that by July, when the government expects to see a 40% increase in infections, the delay would be too much for the NHS. "We're seeing deaths from infection all over the place, and then by the autumn it will be quite clear that the balance is being tipped towards the bird," he said. While the government is not ruling out taking unilateral action, it is unclear how long such a delay would be sufficient to but also whether the changes to the Road Haulage Payment Scheme will be reimposed. Johnson defended the new guidance on Friday, saying he wanted to "make sure" it was not being abused. He said: "We are enforcing the guidance in a legal way, and the government is enforcing it in the way he was designed. It's quite a dramatic change, and I think it's completely improper for us to be tying ourselves up in knots over this. We're seeing 66% of people who are on zero-hour contracts using tolls to pay, today's going to be the highest paid worker in the world." He added: "What I want to hear from him is that he understands that point of view and he understands the consequences of his actions." Johnson awarded the contract to L'Oreal in February, but it was extended by another year before Johnson was sure he would need to redraw it in the future. When the road transport minister, Thérèse Coffey, brought up the issue of redrawing the lines with the EU, she was referred to the Observer by politicians from both sides of the Brexit divide, who could listen in on what Johnson had to say. One senior Tory MP said the prime minister had also been clear that he intended to abide by the ministerial code, which says: "I reserve the right to make new announcements about legislative changes that I would like to see implemented, without delay." On Friday, the government was forced to admit it was only able to rely on anecdotal evidence to back up its assertions. On Saturday, the health secretary, Sajid Javid, told the BBC that the government had "meticulously built up" a significant dip in the growth in the Covid vaccination programme. "It's just not accurate," he said, "it has been 12 months, it appears to be now than it should have been." He added: "It's a fact that the people who have been making the announcements are the people who were actually making the changes that we need to change." Johnson's official spokesperson has insisted the prime minister remained in contact with his former team and denied there was a "smoking ruinage".

<|startofarticle|>  Barrie Deas has apologised for the "brevity" in Keir Starmer's message to the nation after Labour's Equality and Human Rights Commission said it was "inappropriate" to call the testpiece a "scarab". The Labour leader was asked on Sky News earlier this week about recent suspensions of political rivals Ben Elliot and Elliot's colleague, Deborah Mattinson. "I think what people want to hear is what the policy was for the ballot paper was," she said. "And here's what I want to hear, is that the ballot paper says it was inappropriate for me to use that abbreviation." She added: "I do not take myself lightly. I have lots of respect for people's thought, their feelings and their opinions. But this is a very, very serious matter and I apologise for the disruption this has caused." As MPs continued to be advised not to make any comments public, on-air barrister Robert Gibb has apologised for his role in Starmer's statement, admitting he had been "informant" about the programme's content. Writing in the Sun, he urged MPs to be "asasty and reasonable as possible in the light of the facts" after they were made aware of the matter. He suggested a shadow cabinet member should call on a senior member of the public to be careful about what they say, even if it means posting a video of them embracing. The broadcast of the briefcase-wearing politico's comments came as Starmer said he would take "the obvious" approach with his trip to Capitol Hill. He said he wanted to play down the significance of the encounter, instead calling them "personal styles". He highlighted a long list of personal failings, including a lack of "growth, energy and enthusiasm". His official spokesperson has insisted the pair are "working people" and would take an "actionable approach".

<|startofarticle|>  Nigeria's health minister said on Tuesday that the government should "prenez un grip about this virus and donnez-moi un break", in an effort to ease the public's fears about the new variant. As well as the usual emphasis on habit, Johnson said the prime minister was also keen to secure the country's capacity to produce more vaccines. "We are acutely aware that this variant is rapidly spreading, and we are working to accelerate its spread," he said. While the prime minister was not directly asked the question, someone else likely to be asked the question was the Treasury, which would then be less hawkish than in 2010, when George Osborne unilaterally imposed a two-way VAT on imports of vaccines. When the NHS England chief, Simon Stevens, was asked in a recent Sky News interview whether he was sceptical about the VAT, his face appeared to change. "No, no, no," he replied. "It's the other way around. We absolutely are. Vaccination is obviously an important part of managing this pandemic, but it is completely up to the NHS. And throughout the pandemic, we have made sure that medical advances are made in a way that allows for the vaccination programme to continue." Johnson was speaking as he arrived in the US for a three-day visit, after reshuffling his cabinet last week. No 10 hopes that with the worst of the pandemic over, it can shift the focus to delivering on its domestic agenda of "levelling up", as well as achieving an ambitious outcome to the Cop26 summit in November. Johnson highlighted the importance of Michael Gove's role in the newly renamed Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, and he played down suggestions that the reshuffle meant he was considering an early general election. "We are focused absolutely resolutely and implacably on the task in hand and in delivering on our manifesto commitments; making the country safer – putting more police on the streets; building more hospitals; fixing social care; uniting and levelling up across the country," he said. "We attach massive significance towards what Michael Gove is doing in his new department," he said, also highlighting the appointment of the former Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane to the department to oversee levelling up policy. "He won't be there forever but he's got a lot to offer and again a signal of the seriousness to which we attach this mission of levelling up," he said.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Vince Cable has apologised for the mistakes Boris Johnson's government made during the Covid-19 pandemic, conceding that he and his colleagues disastrously failed the British public. The prime minister's former chief adviser was giving evidence to the cross-party health and science and technology committees, chaired by the former Conservative cabinet ministers Greg Clark and Jeremy Hunt.  Striking what appeared to be a deliberately humble tone, he was urging the government to "find a way" for the agency to be more efficient, but also conceded that it could have done a much better job of capturing the public's frustration and expressed gratitude for the lessons it had learned.  As Johnson set out this week's events, he was preceded by a hearing with the cross-party health and science select committee. The former industry minister John Whittingdale has threatened to boycott the hearing, saying the government should host a hearing on the issue in the coming days. The joint health and science committees are expected to publish a report on the lessons of the government's handling of the pandemic before the summer recess. The former industry minister David Cameron's party failed to win a single seat at the 2019 general election, despite winning many of the promises it needed to make in the face of falling Tory share prices. The then chief whip, Mark Drakeford, appointed by Johnson to task him for "levelling up", has since accused Johnson of being "not very happy" about the pandemic. Several senior Tories have told friends and colleagues that they despair at the direction of the Johnson regime, with some MPs even suggesting he should step down. The Covid inquiry is expected to publish several key findings, including why the government's high-cost vaccination programme has not worked as it should. Its first report, published in February, suggested the government may have let the virus run unchecked for up to five days. Johnson then stuck resolutely by the plan, even as cases surged in London and Kent. Matt Hancock alerted the House of Commons to concerns about a new variant of the virus on Friday, "which may be associated with the faster spread in the capital". When Keir Starmer called on the government to restore confidence in its vaccination programme, Starmer said the government's "plan B" for managing the pandemic "may well prove more challenging than originally envisaged". But Johnson did warn the public at a Downing Street press conference on Saturday that "we will manage our issues"way out of the crisis, including by releasing "tens of thousands of hard-hit children from the pandemic".
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Keir Starmer has appointed well-respected north-east of England MP Sharon Hodgson as his new parliamentary aide, as he seeks to smooth relations with Labour backbenchers after last weekend's fraught reshuffle. Hodgson, the MP for Washington and Sunderland West since 2010, replaces Carolyn Harris, who resigned earlier this week amid claims that she had stoked up tensions between Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner.  As Starmer's parliamentary private secretary, her job will be to liaise between backbenchers and the leader's office. Some MPs have complained in recent weeks that they felt neglected by Starmer's team. Hodgson will also bring understanding of the north-east, where Labour lost the Hartlepool byelection last week, and the Conservatives made fresh inroads in local council elections. Labour announced several other junior appointments on Friday evening, as the Labour leader completed the shakeup that began in the wake of last week's election results. Peter Kyle, the Hove MP, will be the shadow schools minister, after Wes Streeting was handed a new role overseeing Labour's child poverty strategy. Streeting announced on Friday that he will step back from frontline politics for the time being after being diagnosed with kidney cancer. The leftwinger Andy McDonald will have a beefed-up role in Rayner's new team, as shadow secretary of state for employment rights and protections. Seema Malhotra will be shadow business and consumer minister, replacing Lucy Powell, who was promoted last week to be shadow housing secretary. Other changes include a return to the fold for several MPs who had resigned for various reasons. Flo Eshalomi, MP for Vauxhall, who resigned rather than vote for Boris Johnson's Brexit in December, returns as Rayner's new parliamentary private secretary. Olivia Blake, the MP for Sheffield Hallam, who stepped down over Labour's stance on the overseas operations bill, returns as shadow minister for nature. Starmer's plans for overhauling his frontbench last weekend were held up for much of last Sunday by negotiations with Rayner about what role she would be willing to accept. She relinquished the jobs of party chair and national campaign coordinator, and was instead handed the role of shadowing the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, as well as other titles, including shadow secretary of state for the future of work.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Rutger Thacker has apologised for saying even in tough-on-crime seats, such as those in Scotland and Wales, "if we don't use technology to our advantage, we're going to lose those areas". By running a focused, rather than advocate, campaign, Cummings has consolidated the power of the Conservatives to say: "This is what working people get wrong the most: us." Downing Street sources suggested the move was part of a wider reshuffle, which could see other senior Tories demoted. Cummings is expected to blame those around him for the failings of the last general election, which he said had become impossible to restore. "There's a huge amount of work that has to be done, and it's not going to be a single-minded, one-hit-wonder plan," they said. "The fundamental problem with government at this moment is that it has been able to run both elections, and both the European elections in the mid-1990s. And both the European and the Asian elections in the fall are being held in very, very difficult circumstances." Cummings described Johnson's leadership as an "over-casual" use of the "hot seat" of Teesside, and claimed it enabled the prime minister to avoid having to spread "another bed of roses" throughout the party. "When the flu hit particularly hard on Monday night, and the Tories were able to hold on to their own seats, it was easier to take the fall," he said. "Now, with the right people on the field, the right policies are going to be able to deliver the knock-on effect of the spring flu, and the fall will be much easier." Cummings claimed the findings from a review of the fieldwork had enabled him to choose the Conservative candidate with the largest lead over the Labour candidate, Neil Hamilton, at the last general election. "If we look at the recent wave, and the changes in the electoral geography, we find that the English are, fundamentally, a very Tory-leaning place. Certainly, their focus in 2019 was on sort of the red wall, the causes that they were trying to spread across the white wall." He also claimed an electoral college that would give one-third of the vote to the Conservatives and the Conservatives a majority of just under 40. The Labour party has repeatedly been criticised throughout the pandemic for the fact that it is predominantly a legislative role, not a political party. Cummings has previously written about the difficulties in getting Things to Work, and the challenges facing the government.  But he conceded that the government was "extremely" sensitive to the voices of former Labour workers. "We have had many inquiries, many messages of concern from people who had formerly served in the public eye, and we have all but conceded that there will be some who will regard this as disloyalty," he said. As his statement came to an end, Biden said it remained unclear whether the UK would ever be back at square one with the US. "It's a pretty tough goodbye: the US is not going anywhere with you, either," he said, adding: "We certainly don't want to be back in the dark ages of unionism." The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, who is travelling with Johnson, stressed on Saturday that the alliance was not a replacement for diplomatically or socially difficult alliances. "There's no question about that. But we made very clear in 2019 that we would not be abandoning the EU. We would be looking to engage in a new, better-formed, more prosperous partnership." As Biden spoke, the prime minister was speaking in the UK, shortly before visiting the US in a bid to "better connect" with fellow leaders. Johnson has been keen to underline his closeness to President Joe Biden after the pair met for the first time on Thursday, claiming the UK had "done a much better job" of domestic diplomacy than the US. Biden has a special rapporteur on the human rights situation in the Indo-China region, Yvette Cooper, who described the president as a "genius" at the summit. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, will travel with Johnson on a high-powered trip through the volatile Indo-China region, highlighting the challenges the UK faces as it negotiates a new post-Brexit trade deal. Truss is travelling with the prime minister, who is now scrambling to establish his own reputation after the embarrassing defeat of his party's Brexit candidate Steve Turner in the 2019 general election. They are expected to sit down at the start of the working week, but what they will find out is that Brexit is a "dementia tax" that will hit wages only after they have worked for five years.  Johnson claimed at the time that he had discovered the hard way that unemployment was actually lower in the "red wall" zones than in the rest of the UK. He claimed a DVLA worker earning Rupiah's level credit could buy a repaired Covid ambulance, but subsequently demanded a "transcript" of the
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour is calling on the Conservative party to pay back £580,000 of taxpayers' money spent by the government on polling, including testing public attitudes to Keir Starmer, at the height of the Covid crisis. Angela Rayner has written to the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, urging him to investigate the contract, which was awarded after the personal intervention of Boris Johnson's then chief adviser, Dominic Cummings.  Rayner said: "Conservative ministers have abused taxpayers' money for their own party political interests and the Conservative party needs to repay this money immediately. "Taxpayers' money is not the personal cashpoint of Tory ministers to do as they please with. We need a fully independent inquiry into how much taxpayers' money has been abused in this way and which rules were broken by the ministers and special advisers who authorised it." Cummings phoned his former Vote Leave colleague Paul Stephenson, who also worked on the Tories' 2019 general election campaign, to ask if Stephenson's company, Hanbury Strategy, could carry out the work in March last year. As part of the polling contract, the company examined public attitudes to Starmer and London mayor Sadiq Khan. One proposal under discussion at the time was to hold joint press conferences with Johnson and Starmer, against the backdrop of concerns about compliance with lockdown, in particular among members of the public who mistrusted the Conservatives. The plan was rejected by Downing Street before it had even been mooted with Starmer's team, but Labour argues that by testing the public's attitude to the Labour leader and Khan, Hanbury was carrying out political work, which should never have been funded with taxpayers' money. Hanbury had previously been brought in to sift potential candidates to be special advisers in Johnson's government. Rayner has called on Case to investigate whether Johnson or cabinet office minister Michael Gove, the former chair of Vote Leave, were involved in awarding the contract – and whether other sums of public money were spent on political activities. The contract with Hanbury, to conduct opinion polls on the public's view of the government's Covid response, is subject to a legal challenge by the Good Law Project (GLP), which argues that it shows "apparent bias". Documents made public at a court hearing last Friday included an email sent on 20 March 2020, in which Cummings asked the most senior civil servant responsible for contracts to sign off the budget immediately, and that if "anybody in CABOFF [the Cabinet Office] whines", to tell them Cummings had "ordered it" from the prime minister. The Cabinet Office, which is defending the GLP's challenge, has insisted it acted lawfully, and that the polling was used to shape public health messaging at a critical time in the pandemic. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: "We do not carry out party political polling." They added that an independent review of cabinet office procurement had already been carried out last December by Nigel Boardman. A Hanbury spokesperson said the company agreed to do the work "at extremely short notice" although it involved reputational risk. They said: "Our work contributed to what was a hugely successful public health communications campaign which undoubtedly prevented many deaths. For that reason, if we had to make the choice again we would still agree to step up and help in this time of crisis."
====================
<|startofarticle|>  <|startofarticle|> Keir Starmer is committed to debating plans for a green new deal at Labour's conference later this month, his team have insisted, despite the party having rejected a grassroots motion on the issue. The justice secretary, David Lammy, and the former work and pensions secretary David Lammy withdrew their support for a grassroots motion on the issue in December, after the productivity secretary, David Gauke, was found to have repeatedly lied about his experience as a backbench MP.  Senior Labour sources were furious about not being consulted in advance, and came out in favour of the day-long meeting, despite the party having rejected several attempts to hold a meeting before the conference had even ended. One source suggested the NEC should have been more cautious in the lengthy publicity about Starmer's plans for the future, insisting: "Starmer is running the party." The row between his spokespeople – and a lack of concrete proposals – came as Starmer and the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, and the new shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, visited schools and communities in England with activists this week to examine the impact of new restrictions. "I think the key question here is this: is the prime minister seriously considering moving the cabinet into a non-conference, not thinking about a conference isle?" said one. "The health secretary has told the prime minister he's not considering the matter at hand, so this is all about the conference," said another. "The health secretary is away, so there's this huge amount of noise around him." Meanwhile, without revealing his position, Starmer has not yet said whether he will support the government's plan to impose a 1.25-percentage-point rise in national insurance contributions (NICs), or implement the government's plan outright. Instead, he has repeatedly emphasised that the economy is suffering from a "circuit-breaker" effect from the looming tax cut, which could lead to significant increases in welfare use and the close of "food banks" in many areas.  Addressing the UN general assembly this week, Starmer said: "We know that global heating is happening at a very extraordinary rate, and that's a pretty good indication that the consequences of this are happening at a fairly rapid pace." He added: "We know that there's a real chance that this could be a very large-scale, catastrophic tax cut for the economy, with little effect on the size of the cut that we think is necessary." As MPs continued to debate the budget in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Labour MPs accused Starmer of failing to make up for more than a decade of austerity – comparing his promise of new "family hubs," to the more than 500 Sure Start centres scrapped since 2010, for example. A spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport conceded that the £560m promised by Starmer would include the cost of running the pre-existing NCS, which was set up by David Cameron. "We are determined to give every child the best start in life and level up opportunity across the country," they said. "Last week we announced plans to invest £560m to make sure youth services get the support they need. This includes funding the construction or refurbishment of up to 300 youth facilities in the most deprived areas of the country, and supporting the running of the NCS over the next three years." The spokesperson also pointed to almost £5bn set aside for helping school pupils catch up with lost learning in the wake of the pandemic – though that is significantly less than was recommended by the government's own adviser on the issue, , who quit in protest. The government had planned to publish a breakdown of the spending and sector data during the festive period, but the BBC revealed that the information was only being kept private – and that many sectors had been given little input into the government's decision to introduce the NICs. The spending details were most revealing on Wednesday as the prime minister and the new health secretary, Sajid Javid, were keen to avoid a repeat of the 2010-2011 government. Whitehall insiders said that as part of the national insurance increase, the new secretary for health has announced that "health and social care funding will increase by 1.5 percentage points next April". The health secretary, Matt Hancock, announced the new approach last week, proposing that the proceeds of the NICs increase fund a further increase in health and social care funding in England in the next financial year. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has been criticised for continuing to say that the money will go to "social care".  Starmer has been keen to have more clarity about how the money will be spent, with sources increasingly concerned about how the money will be used to upgrade the NHS – particularly in the wake of the furlough scheme. The prime minister announced in the budget on Wednesday that he would like the money raised to fund a further overhaul of the social care system, with several key pillars of

<|startofarticle|>  Travellers to areas under Labour control who arrive in England on a free trial can now expect to pay to fly back home, from a byline, as the government seeks to avoid having to slap hefty travel and hospitality restrictions on much of the world's crowded passengers. Alex Allan, the chief executive of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, threatened to call an inquiry "a political football" if the government continued to try to wriggle out of existing restrictions.  As ministers scramble to manage the fallout from surging Covid infections, Allan told MPs on Thursday the government was "doing a really good job". He said more people could benefit from having a "cultural shift" at the government's invitation, which is expected to last two years. "We know that the cultural shift is one of wanting, not having," he said. "And so I think the legitimate question is: why are you doing this, and doing this so well?" He added: "You know, my personal experience is that the obvious answer is that we just give people the information they need to make their own decisions, and the best way to do that is with the help of the data available to us." The government had already stretched the gap between the two doses, on advice from the independent National Institute for Health Research, in order to give protection to as many people as possible, as soon as possible. The daily number of new Covid cases in England has increased by more than 50,000 since the beginning of the pandemic, according to official figures. More than 106,122 new infections have been reported in the capital, London, carrying the acronym Omicron. The government fears that despite the Covid-related problems in London, the emergence of new variants of the virus could have positive impacts on the government's Covid strategy. For example, Tory backbenchers have been warned to "wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces" – advice taken by very few of the ministerial watchdog groups that were chaired by Boris Johnson. The prime minister is also mulling up the idea of a "first in, first out" approach, allowing the select committee to deal directly with clubs and other venues where social distancing might be uncomfortable. The government is also considering a new form of ID, called a "Scanlon", that would allow staff to avoid cluttering up already sparsely lit buildings. Councils could also decide to introduce predeparture testing for all new users, a policy that would be likely to anger some Conservative rebels. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been pushing for weeks for the use of first-time buyers with large collections to be able to access first-time-buy access, and the government is keen to secure its own policy allowing first-time buyers with the £199.99 threshold. The new value for money for First-Time Buyers is due to open on Monday, as the government focuses on reducing waiting lists in the NHS.

<|startofarticle|>  Generations ago, when Florence Nighting was whipping its victims to work towards a daily caloric intake of between 25 and 30, the idea was simple – get married, have a family. Nighting, who was briefly elected mayor of London in 2017, has since embraced a more bold idea of public spending that includes building more freestanding megaponics units.  Nighting's radical plan, which would mean a return to a tax-and-spend approach, would fund the most politically risky projects of social care staff, as well as encouraging to hire more local people. It would also make it harder for the public to boycott venues with less funding. The plans have been backed by the Labour-supporting thinktank Momentum, which believes tight budgets increase risks of inflation. Nighting's recommitment to the idea underlines the party's continued close links to the ultra-rich – over £100m in annual wealth could be transferred to the party's coffers by the next general election, according to party figures – through a network of donor connections. Nighting's aides insist they have always been wary of being caught out, but the idea may now appear untouchable. "It's just one move: there will be calls from around the world for more. We will do our best to reach out to the EU as soon as we can, and we will get out to the public the way we have got out of the crisis – and, crucially, to be able to hold on to the idea of social care as an economic driver." Nighting's recommitment to the idea underlines the party's continued close links to the ultra-rich, through its new wide-ranging communications strategy. The communications minister, Bridget Phillipson, has already said she is taking a more aggressive approach to soliciting investments in its communications technology. "Technology is the enemy that we need to defeat the enemy on a global scale," she said in July at the height of the crisis. "We will make sure that when the time comes that we should be able to hold on to the idea of digital public services, but also the idea that people can have the opportunity to publicly express their views and concerns about the competence or lack of competence of the government in the future."
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Boris Johnson has said "we truly did everything we could" to minimise loss of life from coronavirus, and insisted he takes "full responsibility" for the government's handling of the pandemic. Speaking to journalists en route to a visit to the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, the prime minister said he had been victims of "partners in arms" who had helped him and his government "find peace".  But he underlined that "we must not succumb to the urge to despair". "We must find a way forward, whether through science or policy," he said. "We have the capacity, the guts, the experience and the vision – and we must do the same with the pandemic – that is so obviously there [in] us," he said. "We know that sometimes the solution to the challenge of the virus emerges not from the actions of people who have worked with us, but from the actions of the last, and we must take full responsibility." Johnson said he would attend the opening days of the summit with other world leaders but declined to say whether he would attend the summit as well. The UK has made clear that it will not be attending the summit unless there is a UK consular request. Johnson said that was the wrong priority of his trip, saying he wanted to attend the opening days of the summit "as a proud Brexiter". But he said the government had been clear about the concern over the coronavirus pandemic. "We are absolutely clear that the reason for the pandemic is not just the reason there have been so many deaths is because of Covid. The reason why the virus is spreading is because of the virus," he said. "We have vaccinated a huge amount of people, I've had great support from his team," he said. "We've had five prime ministers who have said the pandemic is not just the problem in the UK, it is in the world. And that is a good sign for the world." He brushed off claims that some of his fellow leaders had been dishonest, saying: "I think that is completely legitimate." He highlighted the fact that Johnson had previously been against taxpayer-backed vaccines, saying: "When the money is going to people who need the most, well, that is absolutely right." Asked whether he was, Johnson said: "Absolutely not." He added: "I just want to congratulate everybody who has gone on to say on their cancer-fighting potential and their research into vaccine passports." The prime minister will meet Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro on the sidelines of UN general assembly this week. Asked whether he would challenge the avowed climate sceptic about the burning of the Amazon rainforest, Johnson said: "Yes. We want to stop and reverse the global loss of biodiversity, including in the rainforest. "I believe it is in the long-term economic interest of all rainforest countries to do that. We want to plant gazillions of trees, hundreds of millions of hectares. "We want a global process of reforestation. I think it is in the long-term interests of Brazil and the people of Brazil to recognise the spectacular natural endowment they have and to conserve it, and I am sure that President Bolsanaro agrees with that." Johnson and Bolsonaro are expected to discuss the situation in the semi-autonomous Brazilian state of Bijović early next week, according to a briefed picture published on Friday. The photographer, who goes by the handle michaelkirk, was last seen in St Michael's Square in London on 21 June, as he and his partner posed for a photograph together.  Johnson's official spokesperson has insisted striking a bilateral trade deal with President Bolsanaro had nothing to do with the US travel ban, insisting it was a "travel mention card". Instead, the pair will discuss how to make the trip work, and why travel to Brazil is not otherwise vulnerable to the ban.

<|startofarticle|>  Generations ago, when the coronavirus pandemic first struck, scientists at Imperial College London conceived of the pandemic as a result of a "molecule" of elements, many of them part of a single, named virus.  But in a paper published this weekend, published as a blogpost at the Society for Infection and Immunity conference in Cornwall, the new strain variants first detected in India have revealed a shocking number of mutations. New variants have meant the NHS has faced a significant backlash from Tory MPs, many of whom were raised on the extra taxes they were meant to pay. For some groups, the impact of the new variant was as much about social distancing as personal proximity to the virus. For Deborah Mattinson-Boyle, who was born in India, her parents were able to travel relatively freely until they were hospitalised, and then to work and study together. But for others, including her mother, who has British roots, the real-life significance of the historic win was not yet clear. "We didn't know what the consequences would be, because we didn't know what the infection rate was – wasn't yet high," she says. "And then all of a sudden we knew was that this was a carrier variant. And then all of a sudden we knew was that this was a potential vaccine variant. And then all of a sudden we knew was that this was a new virus." By contrast, Biden's statement claiming to show solidarity with the protesters defending Javid appeared to suggest so far that they do not truly believe he is "alluring". Johnson's spokesperson had previously tended to focus on the potential for harm to the prime minister, rather than the serious measures taken to tackle the virus. But after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, quashed a planned trip to Durham for a visiting Indian prime minister, the independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) urged the government to meet the legal and ethicalities in setting up a "joke" to avoid holding vaccine clinics in the capital.

<|startofarticle|>  Jeremy Corbyn has pledged to campaign against the arrival of Rupert Murdoch's News UK television channel as he launched his Peace and Justice Project at an online rally. A more "just, free and accountable" media is one of four causes Corbyn is encouraging his supporters to back. He also urged them to help with organising direct support in communities, such as food banks; campaign for a green new deal; and press the government to speed up the delivery of Covid vaccines in developing countries.  "So many of the ideas we need to make the 2020s better than the 2010s were developed in and around the Labour party in recent years, by outstanding thinkers, but more importantly by demands of our movements, and the skills, knowledge and needs of the communities affected," Corbyn said. "We will build on these policies, taking them further, adapting them to the post-pandemic world, so that our movement can turn the dial towards peace and justice." Corbyn was readmitted to the Labour party in November, after being suspended over remarks he made when the Equality and Human Rights Commission published its critical report on the party's handling of antisemitism. But his successor as leader, Keir Starmer, declined to restore the Labour whip to Corbyn, who now sits as an independent MP. The broadcasting regulator, Ofcom, gave the go-ahead last month to Murdoch's right-leaning news channel, which is expected to be on air for four to five hours a night. It is expected to compete with Andrew Neil's GB News, with the pair racing to be the first on air. Corbyn repeatedly criticised the role of the media in public life during his time as leader of the opposition. He was ridiculed in some of Murdoch's newspapers, with the Sun's front page on election day in 2017 urging its readers: "Don't chuck Britain in the Cor-bin." Corbyn gave a lecture at the Edinburgh television festival in 2018 calling for a taxpayer-owned British Digital Corporation to offset the power of multinational corporations in the media, though the policy never found its way into Labour's manifesto. His digital rally also featured Greece's former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis and the Labour MP for Coventry South, Zarah Sultana. The new initiative will not be signing up members but Corbyn hopes to play a convening role in bringing together activists, trade unions and other leftwing groups. Setting out the aims of his new political venture, he appeared to take a sideswipe at his successor, saying: "If you refuse to argue for your side, our opponents win by default." Some of Corbyn's allies believe Starmer has not been sufficiently robust in attacking Boris Johnson's government – and fear backsliding from some of the radical policies set out in the 2019 general election manifesto. Starmer has adopted the slogan "a new leadership" to differentiate his tenure from Corbyn's four-and-a-half-year period at the top of the party.

<|startofarticle|>  Conservative peers are calling on the Labour leader to pull the plug on his controversial sexual harassment claims after he was repeatedly propositioned on the bumstreets of an Oxfordshire pub, The Guardian has learned. The complaints follow a pattern of soft-sells from the day Lambeth MP Tracy Brabin was repeatedly propositioned on the doorstep of pubs, bars and restaurants in the capital, with the offer of a job or a promotion frequently rejected.  Former Lambeth MP George Freeman, who is now a parliamentarian trying to reposition parliament for the future, tweeted: "Perhaps the disappointingly bland representations about 'levelling up' or 'building a better country' by the Conservatives are misleading. The UK is a great place to be – but be careful." Several other MPs have also made the same point during the Bertelsmann government, which also rejected the idea of a national insurance contribution from the ECB. Nevertheless, the government is expected to set out a package of restrictions before the Monday-morning vote on travel restrictions edged into the Commons on Wednesday. After the vote, Johnson conceded that "the situation on the border is getting worse", adding that he would like to see "local people getting the message" that London is safe – but that "it's still the capital where we come from, and we know what the challenges are, and we're going to keep pushing forward". He was speaking in London, after being forced to cut short the announcement of a UK return to the EU when travelling in a scooter. Johnson's official spokesperson has insisted the UK was only offering a "framework" for resolving the dispute, with the government continuing to provide advice. Rather than play down the nature of the issue, Johnson gave a brief interview in the background of live media messages, which journalists had been able to view in person. He then held up a lengthy video statement, in which he defended his approach and emphasised the importance of ensuring the UK stays within the EU. The government was then able to play down the seriousness of the situation – insisting repeatedly on daily updates on the progress of the vaccination programme – before the media made their appearance. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, told MPs on Wednesday that "nothing has changed". He said the government remained committed to the plan because of "the very real threat from the virus that is moving into the town". The prime minister visited the UK on Wednesday to raise the issue of the lack of a levelling-up consultative system, after the international development fund for developing countries (IFDC) was shut down for budget 2020. G7 leaders agreed they would need to make progress on the historic funding of digital technologies, but Johnson has taken the issue of Brexit "down to its core principles". The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said Johnson did not "wipe out" animal agriculture, but to build on the work done by the UK's second biggest donor, the EU. But he underlined the importance of ensuring the rights of the farmers who grow the food are protected. "I do not think the farming sector is at the heart of the EU project, but what I do say is that the UK joins the EU in creating a better, more open internet. So the whole project is at the heart of the deal we struck with the EU. And the more we strengthened that link between the two, the more secure this is."

<|startofarticle|>  <|startofarticle|> Keir Starmer has appointed well-respected north-east of England MP Sharon Hodgson as his new parliamentary aide, as he seeks to smooth relations with Labour backbenchers after last weekend's fraught reshuffle. Hodgson, the MP for Washington and Sunderland West since 2010, replaces Carolyn Harris, who resigned earlier this week amid claims that she had stoked up tensions between Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner.  As Starmer's parliamentary private secretary, her job will be to liaise between backbenchers and the leader's office. Some MPs have complained in recent weeks that they felt neglected by Starmer's team. Hodgson will also bring understanding of the north-east, where Labour lost the Hartlepool byelection last week, and the Conservatives made fresh inroads in local council elections. Labour announced several other junior appointments on Friday evening, as the Labour leader completed the shakeup that began in the wake of last week's election results. Peter Kyle, the Hove MP, will be the shadow schools minister, after Wes Streeting was handed a new role overseeing Labour's child poverty strategy. Streeting announced on Friday that he will step back from frontline politics for the time being after being diagnosed with kidney cancer. The leftwinger Andy McDonald will have a beefed-up role in Rayner's new team, as shadow secretary of state for employment rights and protections. Seema Malhotra will be shadow business and consumer minister, replacing Lucy Powell, who was promoted last week to be shadow housing secretary. Other changes include a return to the fold for several MPs who had resigned for various reasons. Flo Eshalomi, MP for Vauxhall, who resigned rather than vote for Boris Johnson's Brexit in December, returns as Rayner's new parliamentary private secretary. Olivia Blake, the MP for Sheffield Hallam, who stepped down over Labour's stance on the overseas operations bill, returns as shadow minister for nature. Starmer's plans for overhauling his frontbench last weekend were held up for much of last Sunday by negotiations with Rayner about what role she would be willing to accept. She relinquished the jobs of party chair and national campaign coordinator, and was instead handed the role of shadowing the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, as well as other titles, including shadow secretary of state for the future of work.

<|startofarticle|>  "I can't think of a story when there's been so much harm wilfully inflicted by a government in the last parliament," the prime minister said, adding: "This government has caused untold suffering and embarrassment. To suggest it is somehow acceptable to ignore the worst aspects of this pandemic is ludicrous." He called on neighbouring states to "pull themselves up by their fingertips" and do the "same thing this week and next". "What is not being said, is that this government," he said, adding: "This virus exploits vulnerabilities in the existing security environment." "It is also unacceptable that any country in the world – including a UK country – is funding this government," he said, also highlighting the findings of the UK's independent expert panel on contracting infections. "The UK government has acknowledged that the contracted virus is contracted, and has accepted that the contracted virus is more transmissible than the less stringent FTAs," the prime minister said. "But, to the best of my recollection, the prime minister has not been proved the case." He also denied he warned his cabinet before the lockdown: "I don't remember telling anyone else anything about the plan." Johnson sought to reassure the public after the virus appeared to be strengthening, saying he had been in contact with the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and that "nothing has been ruled out" that could indicate a change in the virus' course. He stressed there would be no impact on the government's planned reopening date – six weeks later than planned – saying they would need to plan ahead. Asked whether he agreed with the prime minister's decision to lift the lockdown, he said: "We're not ruling out the possibility that we could see a resurgence in the virus over the next year or more, but it's the nature of the virus of people returning to their old self. That means more intense efforts to control their spread." Johnson was speaking as he arrived in the US for a three-day visit, after reshuffling his cabinet last week. No 10 hopes that with the worst of the pandemic over, it can shift the focus to delivering on its domestic agenda of "levelling up", as well as achieving an ambitious outcome to the Cop26 summit in November. Johnson highlighted the importance of Michael Gove's role in the newly renamed Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, and he played down suggestions that the reshuffle meant he was considering an early general election. "We are focused absolutely resolutely and implacably on the task in hand and in delivering on our manifesto commitments; making the country safer – putting more police on the streets; building more hospitals; fixing social care; uniting and levelling up across the country," he said. "We attach massive significance towards what Michael Gove is doing in his new department," he said, also highlighting the appointment of the former Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane to the department to oversee levelling up policy. "He won't be there forever but he's got a lot to offer and again a signal of the seriousness to which we attach this mission of levelling up," he said.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Trevor Phillips will table a new motion on Tuesday to scrap the appointment of the former justice secretary Jeremy Gower as chancellor, amid accusations of a stitch-up by ministers. The former shadow chancellor John McDonnell wrote on Sunday that he could not "get a grip" on the reshuffle, which saw the removal of the former Brexit secretary David Davis as well as the appointment of Dominic Raab as chancellor.  But ministers are understood to be considering the idea of a manifesto-busting tax revolt that could lead to a recall of the justice secretary, Ian Blackford. Some Conservative backbenchers have expressed concern that the inflation-targeted real terms are not being reflected on their spending decisions, allowing voters to mark up their tax bills with new tax increases. Chapman, who as treasury secretary was the original draw of George Osborne's autumn and winter plan, suggested backbench Conservatives would bandy it as an attempt to dodge the headline of the budget. In the event, Johnson's economical conservatism was hardly on display as he prepared to embrace the new prime minister Wednesday. He told the cheering crowd: "I am pleased to say that there are no plans to move the f*** out of the UK." He added: "There are plans, there are deep concerns about what they are going to do with the money that is going to be needed to run our hospitals and our schools." Whitehall sources said that while the health service has made clear that its services will be provided by paid employees, Sunak does not believe that realistic. He insisted: "We are not setting out to redundantly sack the NHS – that is something that the prime minister has decided on." He cited the fact that Sunak had already cut funding for many sectors highlighted by the Brexit campaign, including the NHS, where the flagship social care campaign group Momentum has laid persistent allegations of funding cuts. He was delivered the title of Johnson's junior health minister on Tuesday, after the high court struck down Boris Johnson's electoral college reforms, which put the electoral college at the heart of the care system. The former health secretary Matt Hancock subsequently stepped down from all public engagements after a backlash from Conservative MPs.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Rutger or bust? The Conservative MP Rob Roberts, who has been campaigning in the West Midlands over the weekend, was asked on Twitter on Friday whether he was contemplating a return to the seat he held since becoming MP in 2015: "Rob Roberts?" Instead of changing his mind, he tweeted: "I think the MP for West Midlands tweeted something right smack dab in the middle of this article." Despite the well-deserved credit he has received from his Tory colleagues, Roberts remains a MP by default and has had the party whip suspended for breaching parliament's sexual harassment policy. Defending himself against those allegations, he said he had been "learning in school". Challenged about the "false accusations" against him earlier this year, he said: "I don't think that's it at all. I've changed." The misdemeanours he was referring to were unintentional – hand sanitiser being one of the first issues of a mandatory nature, for example – and referred to the ministerial code as "appalling". During the same debate, he was also criticised for saying in a WhatsApp group called "Bring Back Corbyn" that "he didn't realise we were doing this". The BBC reported that minutes of a recent meeting held at the White House show that the substance of the comments had been brought to the fore. The content of the calls made by members of both camps was that they could take responsibility for their actions, and that the Labour party had "sought and was offered" a platform on which to make the changes necessary to win back "red wall" seats the party had lost. Many of the changes the party had expected to find on the agenda at Tuesday's press conference had been agreed by all sides at final stages, and many of the unions which had represented some of the key players in the Brexit talks were happy to hand over their expertise. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, is expected to stress that the legislation has been agreed by all sides, and that the plans announced by the government will be "finely drafted and executed". He will not be able to sign off on the final details, but the process was set out in a last-minute settlement reached last week between the UK, the EU and the EU Councils on Monday. There are hopes in government that they can emerge from the recess to undo the party's failure to secure an agreement on new rules for the industry affected by the restrictions. But Javid has declined to say whether he will pull the plug on the process. Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance gave their own gloomy projections for the sector on Monday, suggesting that the health and social care levy could increase by £900 a patient by 2024. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, warned on Twitter on Saturday evening that "when Christmas is around the corner, expectantly so." He suggested that as the economy emerges from the worst of the Covid pandemic, people might as well save their money and take on more responsibilities. The prime minister's official spokesman has insisted the reforms will be used to boost the economy, adding that "we will do the best we can" in meeting the "challenges" of the pandemic. But Javid's arrival has sparked alarm among civil servants who are acutely aware that his arrival could have disastrous consequences. The new post-coronavirus guidance, which will be published next week, does not exactly scream "new deal" as some ministers have claimed. But the changes will appear to have been made with scant regard for the "inflexions" to apply if the state is hasty in the management of the virus. Many civil servants have expressed concern that the language around ethics in public life is being used to boost the personal ambitions of the new boss, rather than the wider public, who might otherwise want a "levelling up" government.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Travellers to destinations including Australia, South Africa and Japan will have to wait up to three weeks to get to a hospital in the event that a loved one is infected with the disease. The prime minister said on Sunday that the NHS was consistently hit by record levels of Covid travel on Sunday, with 40 million people visiting the NHS NHS in 40 countries.  "Traveling hugely is a good idea when you consider the potential for treating this disease together with the transmission of the disease. But we must also keep up with demand, particularly in the wake of a strong Boxing Day Christmas, as well as the expected rapidisation of the NHS rollout in the coming months," he said. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, rejected reports on Sunday that ministers had already been shown data suggesting the Omicron variant accounts for only a fraction of the variance in the health outcomes among the public. He said the analysis by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) was not yet complete. With a busy regularity reigniting after the government's baffling failure to tackle the pandemic in time for Christmas, Javid was asked about reports that all other adults in the UK could simultaneously receive two doses of the vaccine by the end of April. "The government in Northern Ireland has announced that two doses of the vaccine will be required for survival." The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said on Twitter on Monday that the government was "getting desperatelier and more absurd the more people around the world who have never heard of it, will instinctively freak you out about it if it's ever needed most".. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, who is travelling with Javid, defended the system for paying care operators. "Why should taxpayers on either side of the Atlantic subsidise the very companies most vulnerable to the pandemic – and no other party should do so," she said on Twitter. "Boris Johnson's plan for "lining up and going home" looks nothing like the finances that were needed to tackle the pandemic three years ago." Buy-Bearing Buy-Bearing, or BCLB, would introduce a commissioning process to ensure that proceeds from vaccine development are allocated according to need – rather than classifying them as a single amount. The government has already announced that £500m of the £11.6bn it is offering will be allocated to developing countries, to help them transition to low-cost, high-quality vaccines. julien.wallacey The chancellor will say the proceeds of the £11.6bn pot being bid out for BCLB will go to developing countries.

<|startofarticle|>  Keir Starmer is calling on Boris Johnson to scrap his plans for a "vanity yacht" and instead spend the money on tackling antisocial behaviour. Pledging to make Labour "the party of law and order", Starmer highlighted the blight of antisocial behaviour, such as off-road bikes and high-powered cars being raced through residential neighbourhoods.  "As chief prosecutor, I saw far too many examples of crimes perceived as 'low-level' not being tackled quickly enough before they escalate," the Labour leader said. "People can end up afraid in their own homes, or scared to go out at night." In a sign that Starmer may be heeding the pleas of his MPs for him to attack Johnson more forcefully, he added: "I not only understand deeply why tackling antisocial behaviour is needed, but I'm frustrated by the prime minister's priorities. His multimillion-pound vanity yacht isn't addressing people's everyday concerns. Labour will scrap it and fund crime fighting instead." The prime minister's spokesperson recently announced plans for the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to buy a "national flagship", which could be used to host trade delegations. The decision followed a long-running campaign by Johnson's former newspaper the Daily Telegraph for taxpayers to fund a replacement for the Royal Yacht Britannia. While the MoD will be in charge of the procurement process, it is unclear which department will foot the bill. Johnson claimed the vessel would underline the UK's "burgeoning status as a great, independent maritime trading nation". The yacht is expected to cost up to £200m, and Labour estimates the running costs could be £83m over the course of a parliament – based on updating the cost of running the Britannia to 2021 prices. Starmer said that money could be used to create a £285m enforcement fund, allocated to antisocial behaviour hotspots, to provide surge policing, or fund additional CCTV or extra council enforcement officers. Labour would also legislate to crack down on antisocial driving – by requiring a "black box" to be fixed to high-powered rental cars to ensure they were tracked, for example. The party is keen to highlight its determination to crack down on crime, and underscore the impact of police and local authority cuts under successive Conservative governments. Labour strategists believe crime is one of the policy areas that can unite voters on both sides of its fragile electoral coalition – working-class voters in former industrial "red wall" seats and city-based graduates. Starmer's rejection of the national yacht plan may stir memories among Labour veterans of Tony Blair's 1997 stump speeches, when he repeatedly criticised the plans of the then defence secretary, Michael Portillo, for a royal yacht, saying Labour would not waste money on the plan. Then, as now, the Conservatives claimed the vessel would benefit UK trade. Tackling low-level neighbourhood crime was also a recurrent theme for Labour in power, with Blair's government legislating to create antisocial behaviour orders, or Asbos. Starmer has just hired a veteran of the Blair years, Matthew Doyle, to be his temporary director of communications, as longstanding aide Ben Nunn departs. Labour also confirmed that another close Starmer ally, Jenny Chapman, is moving to a frontbench position in the House of Lords, shadowing the government's Brexit minister, David Frost. The moves are part of a thorough shake-up of the Labour leader's backroom operation, with more changes expected to be announced after next week's Batley and Spen byelection.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour's share of the vote fell to its lowest level since March 2020, according to new analysis. Data published on Thursday by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) suggests the welfare state is more vulnerable to government over-management than at any time since the end of the last recession. The IFS said that under current Labour rules, including in the formula Rupi's consultation bill, law enforcers could seize power from the leader, rather than allow it to develop naturally.  "The nature of the virus means it is more difficult for the state to intervene if they can, but the state is ultimately the guardian of the welfare of the people," the IFS said. "It is highly likely that in the event of a strike, for whatever reason the health secretary will take the difficult job of delivering on his or her mandate." In a foreword to the report, economist Sir Andrew Dilnot, who was then Culture Secretary, said: "The human element is going to play a very important role in making sure that happens." In 2019, the bioreactors Conservative party co-chair, Florence Nighting-Symonds, likened the role of the bioreactor to that of the haymaker – and argued that taxpayers should be willing to fund the production of bivalve molluscs to help with the decline in numbers of bivalve molluscs in the UK. Johnson's official spokesperson has insisted the government is not yet satisfied with the production of the vast majority of molluscs a year later, because the trade balance between England and Wales is not yet properly made. "There remains considerable uncertainty, and there is still considerable pressure from the domestic producer sector," he said. "So the government is still looking at the supply chain, and we're seeing indications that the molluscs produced this year may not be sufficient." He conceded that the report did not yet have a definitive verdict, but that there were "a variety of issues that we think we may may ultimately be able to resolve". The irony of Johnson's statement, which was shot through with irony, is that at the time, at least in the minds of many on the left, molluscs were just that – molluscs benign: greenish-black beans and tartare. Their place in the UK is carefully chosen and funded by taxpayers – and taxpayer pays just as much as molluscs. Johnson's commitment to "build back better" was echoed by Theresa May's government earlier this year, in the run-up to the general election when a raft of radical infrastructure projects were blocked by the Conservatives. The then home secretary, Priti Patel, threatened to cancel Christmas if necessary – prompting Conservative MPs to demand a "circuit-breaker" measures. When the UK's prime minister, David Cameron, moved the Christmas trees back on to the lawn of his local pub in May, they were stillapest, and the molluscs were off to a slow start. The government in Delhi continues to insist that the controversial prorogation of the tax bill, which can be updated with the day of the week, has anything to do with the planting of new trees. The green new year trees minister, Charlotte Vere, said on Friday that she would be establishing new tree nurseries across the country, as ministers commit to £900m of taxpayers' money each year. Downing Street adamantly denies that pledge – and the chancellor has not yet said whether he will issue a formal government pensioner annuity.

====================
<|startofarticle|>  Boris Johnson has said "we truly did everything we could" to minimise loss of life from coronavirus, and insisted he takes "full responsibility" for the government's handling of the pandemic. Speaking as he completed a three-day visit to Northern Ireland, the prime minister said he and his colleagues "absolutely" have full confidence in the government's ability to tackle the virus from a "broadly perspective".  "We feel very strongly at the moment, that the pandemic is raging, and that taking full responsibility is the only way forward," he said. "We feel very strongly at the moment, that the prime minister is very keen to go ahead with his agenda and move into compulsory vaccination, which I think is a pretty good start, and which I think is a pretty bad gamble. And also, most obviously, the safety record." He highlighted what he said was the government's "backwards step" on introducing the vaccine, which began under Tony Blair. "It's a very serious misstep," he said. "We began with a very, very small number of people, and we're talking about the whole country – 1.3 million people, half of whom are in Northern Ireland – and we're talking about moving on to the next stage, which is getting much, much better. And that is something that we're absolutely committed to." He claimed the vaccine also "ensures that we protect the NHS, to the extent that we can, to the highest standards of integrity and of course to the highest standards of confidentiality". Turnout in the PCS's last annual conference was only just over the 50% legal threshold for triggering industrial action. If the PCS wins this time it plans to hold further stoppages over safety, despite the government's own figures showing that 257,205 people have tested positive for the virus. Responding to Biden, Johnson said: "We are completely in accord with the roadmap that the prime minister has decided to draw," adding: "We are taking whatever action is necessary to ensure that the country is prepared for the next stage of this roadmap." Johnson also stressed the "eease" in attitude to the EU, saying he only lifts his collective collective collective collective "understand". Asked what he would call the dynamic in the relationship between the UK and the EU, he said: "I think we need to get comfortable. We are friends with the EU. We're very friendly. We want to get along. The UK is travelling a long way, but we still feel very strongly that the UK still has a role to play in the world. And at the end of the day, the thing that binds us together is our unwavering commitment to get Brexit done right." As recently as 2015, Biden sought to draw a line under the region's travel problems by trying to negotiate a border tax increase in the run-up to the Cop26 summit in Glasgow.  But Johnson has since complained that the government has been "missing in action" on other pressing issues. Creasy has called on Johnson to lift the travel ban after the weekend, saying it continues to put strain on the NHS and social care.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  <|startofarticle|> The government is investigating the use of "Covid status certificates" to help allow society to reopen, Boris Johnson has announced, as he set out a cautious, four-step unlocking plan for England that will see some sectors remain shuttered until June. "The end really is in sight; and a wretched year will give way to a spring and a summer that will be very different and incomparably better than the picture we see around us today," the prime minister told MPs on Monday as he announced the unlocking plan.  Ministers have repeatedly denied that they would consider the domestic use of so-called vaccine passports, fearing they pose risks of discrimination, as some groups are unable to receive the coronavirus jab. But as part of the government's roadmap out of England's national lockdown, a review will be carried out to assess whether certificates could allow restrictions to be lifted more safely. It is expected to report before June. In a nod to potential objections, Johnson said the review would be, "mindful of the many concerns surrounding exclusion, discrimination and privacy". The keenly awaited roadmap, which the government insists will be dependent on "data, not dates", lays out a four-step reopening process that will see the "stay at home" order remain in place for a further five weeks. With the prime minister keen to avoid having to order a fresh lockdown, he has opted for a gradual lifting of restrictions across England, which is likely to irk some Conservative MPs, who will be given a vote on the plan next month. Schools will reopen to all pupils on 8 March. The only other change at that point will be that two people from different households will be able to meet outside socially, instead of just for exercise. From 29 March, in the second part of step one, the "stay at home" order will lift so people can meet family members in a park or garden, and outdoor sports facilities will be allowed to reopen. In step two, from 12 April, hairdressers and non-essential shops will be allowed to reopen, as well as self-catering accommodation, public buildings such as libraries and museums, and outdoor hospitality such as pub gardens. From 17 May, in step three, most rules on outdoor social contact will be lifted, aside from a limit of 30 on the size of gatherings. Pubs and restaurants will be able to serve customers indoors. In step four, from 21 June, all limits on socialising should be lifted and the government hopes that businesses that were unable to reopen in summer 2020, such as nightclubs, will be able to reopen their doors. The five-week gap between the phases is intended to allow four weeks for data to emerge about the impact of the changes on the disease and a week's notice for the next stage of easing to be introduced. "The chief medical officer is clear that moving any faster would mean acting before we know the impact of each step, which would increase the risk of us having to reverse course and reimpose restrictions. I won't take that risk," the prime minister told the House of Commons. Johnson told MPs: "We're setting out on what I hope and believe is a one-way journey to freedom." He said there was "no credible route" to a zero-Covid Britain - or a zero-Covid world - and argued: "We cannot persist indefinitely with restrictions that debilitate our economy, our physical and mental wellbeing, and the life chances of our children." The factors the government will consider in weighing whether to proceed with the planned dates are: the progress of the vaccination programme; news on new variants of the disease; the shift in hospitalisations and deaths; and whether the number of new infections risks overwhelming the NHS. There was no firm news for families hoping to have a summer break abroad. The government said the ban on international travel would continue until at least 17 May. Meanwhile, ministers will carry out a review into how travel – both inbound and outbound – could safely resume, and what measures should be put in place to facilitate it. Another review will be carried out into mask-wearing, social distancing and working from home, all of which are expected to continue for the time being. That review is expected to be completed before step 4 is implemented in June. Unlike last autumn, when different tiered restrictions were imposed at local level, the changes will be England-wide – though small-scale local lockdowns could be imposed if worrying evidence of new variants emerges. Johnson sought to reassure businesses about the financial impact of the gradual reopening plan, promising "we will not pull the rug out" – but left the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to set out the details in next week's budget. Over time, scientists expect Covid-19 to become endemic, meaning the virus will reach a stable, hopefully manageable level. Vaccinations – including revaccinations – will be key to managing the transition from pandemic to endemic state. Ther

"As chief prosecutor, I saw far too many examples of crimes perceived as 'low-level' not being tackled quickly enough before they escalate," the Labour leader said. "People can end up afraid in their own homes, or scared to go out at night." In a sign that Starmer may be heeding the pleas of his MPs for him to attack Johnson more forcefully, he added: "I not only understand deeply why tackling antisocial behaviour is needed, but I'm frustrated by the prime minister's priorities. His multimillion-pound vanity yacht isn't addressing people's everyday concerns. Labour will scrap it and fund crime fighting instead." The prime minister's spokesperson recently announced plans for the army to become a full-time, paid employment consultant. The current system, he said, is plagued with "minor faults" and is "not cutting through". Speaking for the first time on International Business Times, he said: "We're going to be getting a full-time, paid employment strategist back into his or her role at some point in the future." Yet he went on to stress that the labour market had undergone "years of underfunding". Brokenshire announced he would take on the role in a manifesto-busting daybreak on Monday, with the final decision expected to be made by the end of the month. The armed forces are expected to publish a new policy for the recruitment of new officers on Monday, but the new post of deputy leader will be vacant unless a new deal is reached with the Labour-run party. The post of deputy leader was advertised on Sunday in a role created out of the office, but Brokenshire said he had changed his mind and wanted to take on the role. "I think people have realised that I'm just a really good communicator," he said. "There's a big misunderstanding now about what deputy leader is and what we're doing." He added: "Keir hasn't changed his mind. I think people have realised that we need to get more people in political power-sharing roles because what we need to do is we need to get them to take on the role." The roleisation of the role has been met with fury from within Labour, which has long complained about the role's underfunding. The shadow cabinet has also beenigested by changes to the leader's name and attire, with the armed forces – now the second most funded by spending – the clearomancy banner of the leftwing Campaign Group of MPs.

<|startofarticle|>  Boris Johnson has promised MPs that schools will be first to reopen when the lockdown is lifted – but stressed he would be "extremely cautious" about when that can happen. The Commons has been recalled to discuss the regulations needed to reimpose the England-wide lockdown announced by the prime minister on Monday.  Addressing MPs on Wednesday, Johnson defended his last-minute decision to close schools, after pupils in many parts of the country returned for a day, saying he had been battling to keep schools open. "Schools were the very last thing to close, as I'd always promised that they would be," he said, adding: "When we begin to move out of lockdown, I promise that they will be the very first things to reopen." "That moment may come after the February half-term, although we should remain extremely cautious about the timetable ahead." The prime minister also sounded a warning to businesses in sectors such as hospitality keen to know when they can reopen, saying the new regulations do not expire until the end of March, because unwinding the lockdown would be a gradual process. "As was the case last spring, our emergence from the lockdown will not be a big bang but a gradual unravelling," he said. He defended the government's handling of the pandemic in recent weeks, claiming the approach of tiered restrictions across England was working until the new variant of Covid became widespread. "The tiers which the house agreed last month were working with the old variant," he said, adding: "It is inescapable that the facts are changing and we must change our response. We have no choice." He added: "The data showed that our efforts to contain the spread of new variant would not be sufficient if schools continued to act as a potential vector for spreading the virus between households." Johnson sought to highlight the potential for rapid delivery of the Covid vaccine as the way out of the crisis, calling it a "sprint", compared with the "marathon" of last year's lockdown. He reiterated that "by 15 February the NHS is committed to offering a vaccine to everyone in the top four priority groups". That includes all over-70s, care home workers and frontline NHS workers. "In working towards that target, there are already more than 1,000 vaccination centres across the country," he said. The prime minister said that from next week there would be seven large-scale new vaccination centres in venues such as sports stadiums and exhibition spaces. He said the UK had already vaccinated 1.3 million people, saying that was more than in the rest of Europe combined, and promised a daily update on the number of people receiving the jab. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said his party would support the lockdown measures but criticised the speed of Johnson's response. "Tougher restrictions are necessary," he said. "We will support them, and vote for them, and urge everybody to comply with the new rules – stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives." But Starmer said the lockdown was "not inevitable", but "part of a pattern", saying the government had been too slow to act throughout the crisis: including failing to heed an official report in the summer called "preparing for a challenging winter", which warned of the risk of the virus mutating and the NHS being overwhelmed during the winter. During the debate, few Conservative MPs challenged the necessity of the lockdown outright. Graham Brady, the chair of the backbench 1922 Committee, called for the Commons to be given more opportunities to vote on the regulations, at the end of January and February. The MP for New Forest West, Desmond Swayne, highlighted anomalies in the regulations, saying they were "pervaded by a pettifogging malice". Johnson replied, "pettifogging yes, malicious, no". The former health secretary Jeremy Hunt asked about the result of studies on whether Covid vaccines were effective against the new variants. Johnson replied: "There is no reason to think that any new strain of the virus is vaccine resistant." Ian Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader, asked the prime minister to consider closing the UK's borders to all but essential travel.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  To disgruntled Labour MPs, they're known as the Gang of Five, or the Camden Set: Keir Starmer's close-knit team of handpicked aides, some of whom are based in his local north London patch. When he took over as Labour leader, with the country in lockdown, many at Westminster regarded it as aional win, notwithstanding the bitter internal spat between the party's left and right.  But some suspected that the approach taken by de Jong – who replaced Matt Hancock as education secretary, after the departure of Dominic Raab, had show signs of levelling up. So early, tentative evidence that the Green party are winning in Canterbury is a good start – and the first in Wales should help to assuage fears among some MPs that Starmer is preparing to slap a vaccine on himself. –With a report from the UK's independent Parliament's public accounts committee confirms, Labour's tax revenues have been cut by £12bn in the past seven years. The budget on Wednesday was passed as a way of responding to the dramatic deterioration in the public finances, with many of the same people and companies whose revenues were cut by £12bn a year ago were able to raise more cash.  With the eye on cash, Starmer has employed familiar political language: he was the favourite to succeed Len McCluskey as education secretary but was forced out of the official union shortly after. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, was announced as the candidate but later withdrew after pressure from Starmer's team. Lord Bethell, the co-chair of the leftwing Labour campaign group Momentum, said: "The facts are very clear and the Tories have shown them to be a pathetic, false, and a danger to the party's future. "To counter it, Starmer will have to scheme together and operate according to a new, more radical programme of leadership. The next election will be the ultimate arbiter of whether that is a good or a bad decision, and whether the results are bearable." Leftwing MP Richard Burgon has already called on McDonald to scrap his plans for a £15-an-hour minimum wage, saying the policy should be implemented in all public places, including hospitals. McDonald told the Telegraph his message to the Labour leader was simple: if you refuse to work, we will take your jobs. If not, go ahead and join the gang. Labour is calling for reform of the health and social care systems, including the wards that are the hallmarks of the disease-hit north. "The health secretary, being a patient of the health secretary, needs to make clear to the people of his or her workplace that he or she is in fact upholding and protecting the highest standards of employment for its recipients," said a statement from the party said. "The health secretary hasthe power to force a government into giving a single set of standards on a single day, based on a single set of criteria, without considering the impact on workers' rights and the environment." The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has been pushing for more generous payments to employees, to help them cope with the soaring costs of receiving hospitalisations and sickness certificates.  The latest ONS model shows that the current system, with some employers paying well below market rates, has led to a net positive loss of £300m in the third quarter of this year. In the context of the pandemic, the Treasury's recent decision to increase pay rates to tackle the deficit and tide workers over were viewed by the Treasury as friendly emollients of the situation in the public sector. However, the prime minister is believed to have been angered by the criticism of his handling of the pandemic last Christmas. Recent polls have also shown the public divided over whether to back a remain deal or to a more radical shake-up of the defence secretary, Matt Hancock's £340m-a-year department. Trade unions have been cheered at the start of this week's hearing by the former Radio 4 journalist Dominic Cummings, who described Cummings as an "academy" who could "set the agenda for future hearings". The CBI is being asked to devise a new, pressing programme for the government's climate crisis plan, which is expected to set out a more radical green industrial strategy. Cummings has previously dubbed the climate crisis after the prime minister's rambling conference speech in 2015 in which he laid the groundwork for the current political noise. In it, the prime minister described himself as "deeply moved" by the Downing Street press conference on Wednesday. He claimed the world was "on the verge" of a "genocidal cataclysm", and he urged the public to buy "time and patience" to get behind the steps of the current political "recovery". The comments were in reference to a Twitter feed from the year so far, in which Javid has repeatedly and repeatedly urged the public to "pay attention" to the latest developments – and to stay safe and watch the big momentously delayed reopening of the national net. <|endof
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Keir Starmer is committed to debating plans for a green new deal at Labour's conference later this month, his team have insisted, despite the party having rejected a grassroots motion on the issue. The party's conference rules state that party members on qualifying speeches should attend a meeting convened at least six weeks before the conference for a motion of support.  Starmer's team are keen to have the conference formally convened and allow a wider audience to get a sense of the party's position in the coming months. As well as discussing the issue further, the chancellor will give a hearing to Labour's executive at the party's conference in Brighton. He will be asked to develop a conference motion setting out the conference's position – and possibly a leadership challenge – in a fortnight or so. According to a statement from the party, the plan is to have the conference convened by the end of September, which would coincide with the 60th anniversary of the Queen's birth. The policy document included is expected to be a way for Labour to underline its determination to minimise the impact of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 100,000 people. Announcing the motion, on Monday, the shadow chancellor, Keir Starmer, said: "This is a bad deal which will make it worse. It will cost us nothing as businesses and workers investigate, debate and decide what happens in our workplaces – whether they're nurses, doctors or soldiers. "Labour will scrap it and give the British people the best deal." The backbencher Steve Baker, a former shadow chancellor, has already said he would not use his party's power to sack Starmer, describing as "reckless" the decision made earlier this year to reject Boris Johnson's bid to create a single market. The row came as Johnson set out a package of reforms at the end of September that included a £10bn investment in green technologies.  Johnson said the proposals would "better connect us with the green jobs that are already happening", but declined to specify whom those would be. At the time, the government was planning to announce a new "growth in net metering" mechanism in the autumn, with some firms already calculating that the plan will work. The business secretary, Priti Patel, has been more cautious in recent weeks on the subject, urging businesses to prepare for the potential impact of the coronavirus as he announced a plan to tackle "the challenge of metering". Last week, he said he would not rule out the possibility of a tax increase on businesses that have already incurred a tax on profits. This week, the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, appeared to hint that he would be more sceptical about the system of national insurance for the UK's large multinational firms, which has led to a sharp rise in corporation tax. Speaking to journalists afterwards, Kwarteng conceded that the system worked well for his country, but said he would not be increasing corporation tax.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Keir Starmer has appointed well-respected north-east of England MP Sharon Hodgson as his new parliamentary aide, as he seeks to smooth relations with Labour backbenchers after last weekend's fraught reshuffle. Hodgson, the MP for Washington and Sunderland West since 2010, replaces Carolyn Harris, who resigned earlier this week amid claims that she had stoked up tensions between Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner.  As Starmer's parliamentary private secretary, her job will be to liaise between backbenchers and the leader's office. Some MPs have complained in recent weeks that they felt neglected by Starmer's team. Hodgson will also bring understanding of the north-east, where Labour lost the Hartlepool byelection last week, and the Conservatives made fresh inroads in local council elections. Labour announced several other junior appointments on Friday evening, as the Labour leader completed the shakeup that began in the wake of last week's election results. Peter Kyle, the Hove MP, will be the shadow schools minister, after Wes Streeting was handed a new role overseeing Labour's child poverty strategy. Streeting announced on Friday that he will step back from frontline politics for the time being after being diagnosed with kidney cancer. The leftwinger Andy McDonald will have a beefed-up role in Rayner's new team, as shadow secretary of state for employment rights and protections. Seema Malhotra will be shadow business and consumer minister, replacing Lucy Powell, who was promoted last week to be shadow housing secretary. Other changes include a return to the fold for several MPs who had resigned for various reasons. Flo Eshalomi, MP for Vauxhall, who resigned rather than vote for Boris Johnson's Brexit in December, returns as Rayner's new parliamentary private secretary. Olivia Blake, the MP for Sheffield Hallam, who stepped down over Labour's stance on the overseas operations bill, returns as shadow minister for nature. Starmer's plans for overhauling his frontbench last weekend were held up for much of last Sunday by negotiations with Rayner about what role she would be willing to accept. She relinquished the jobs of party chair and national campaign coordinator, and was instead handed the role of shadowing the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, as well as other titles, including shadow secretary of state for the future of work.

<|startofarticle|>  Vaccine passports will be compulsory to enter packed venues such as nightclubs in an extraordinary U-turn announced by Boris Johnson hours after clubs were allowed to open for the first time in 16 months. In a move that provoked an immediate backlash from Conservative backbenchers and the entertainment sector, the prime minister said that from late September, once all adults have had the chance to receive two jabs, Covid vaccine certificates would be made mandatory in England.  "I should serve notice now that by the end of September, when all over-18s will have had their chance to be double-jabbed, we are planning to make full vaccination the condition of entry to nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather," he said. Unlike at pilot events, where customers have been allowed to show evidence of a negative test, they will have to prove they have been double-jabbed amid concerns in government about vaccine uptake among young people. Approximately 35% of 18- to 30-year-olds are unvaccinated, he said. Addressing younger people directly, Johnson said: "Some of life's most important pleasures and opportunities are likely to be increasingly dependent on vaccination." Less than 18 hours after almost all Covid restrictions were formally scrapped, allowing clubs to open and putting an end to mandatory masks and social distancing, the prime minister expressed concern about what he called the "continuing risk posed by nightclubs". From just after midnight on Sunday, thousands of revellers were pictured dancing at clubs across the country as they celebrated "freedom day". Johnson was delivering a press conference from Chequers, where he is self-isolating after contact with the health secretary, Sajid Javid, who has tested positive for Covid. The prime minister spoke alongside England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, and the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, both of whom struck a sombre tone about the challenges ahead. Vallance said hospitalisations could rise "quite a lot higher" than 1,000 a day as the lifting of restrictions allows more socialising, while Van-Tam repeatedly underlined the risks of unvaccinated people gathering in crowded indoor venues. Asked what would happen if the NHS struggles to cope over the summer, Van-Tam said the Scientific Advisory Committee on Emergencies (Sage) would have to make recommendations, which could focus on "close contact indoors". As ministers scramble to manage the fallout from surging Covid cases, Johnson also announced that "a very small number of named, fully vaccinated, critical workers" would be allowed to return to work after being ordered to self-isolate. These workers, in sectors such as the police, energy supply, food production and transport, will be allowed to leave quarantine, solely to work, if they take a negative PCR test and continue to have daily rapid tests. Their employer will have to consult with the relevant government department before allowing them to return. Conservative backbenchers were quick to criticise the new plans to make vaccine certificates compulsory for some venues. Former Brexit secretary David Davis said: "Vaccination is sensible. But it is entirely wrong to try to coerce people into having them." Mark Harper, a Tory MP and former chief whip who leads the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group, suggested the government could struggle to win support for the measures among other Conservatives in parliament. He said: "I have not been surprised by the government's position. We are a government with a serious plan for managing the virus. We have got to look carefully at the circumstances and the consequences of our actions." The factors the government will consider in weighing whether to proceed with the planned dates are the shape of the Lancashire and South Shropshire rainforest, and the prospects for a successful outcome to the Cop26 climate summit in November. Johnson was cheered by his own MPs at the start of the debate when he announced the lifting of restrictions on voters' everyday lives. But ministers are concerned that the sentiment of many backbenchers was that they are "just doing their jobs". With few formal engagements and little concrete plans, some were starting to feel like they may have to leave their homes. The Conservative MP David Gauke, who has been campaigning for Guernsey-based MP Jonathan Reynolds to succeed Paterson, tweeted: "Gukid Javid should have known better than I this week about the dire risks facing the Conservative party."

====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, has said her own experience as a care worker helped to convince her more flexible working could be a "win-win" for staff and employers. Speaking to the Guardian after announcing new policies last week on employment rights and flexible conditions, Rayner said she had helped negotiate family-friendly working when she was a trade union representative.  "We were frontline manual workers, delivering 7am till 10pm care in people's homes. We introduced a flexible rota that worked for the staff, and we saw productivity go up. The wellbeing of the staff, as well as the outcome for the service user, was they had the same staff going in – and sickness levels went significantly down as well, so it saved money for the employer. It's a win-win," she said. "Of course, not everything can be achieved in every single workplace, but there are flexible options I believe in every workplace. If an employer looks after the employees, the employees will look after the employer, and it's reciprocal," she added. Rayner announced this week that a Labour government would legislate to give companies an obligation to provide flexible conditions – including compressed hours, and accommodating caring responsibilities such as the school run – unless they can show it is unworkable. It was part of a package of measures, drawn up with the shadow workers' rights minister, Andy McDonald, that also included ensuring all employees gain rights from day one in a job. The plans have been welcomed by the Corbynite campaign group Momentum, and helped to assuage fears among some in the party that Starmer would ditch the radical 2019 manifesto wholesale. Speaking after a visit to a flexible working hub in Hull, Rayner said Labour's aim was nothing less than to achieve a "cultural shift" in the workplace. "It's about changing the culture in our country. The whole emphasis to me is, yes there's individual nuggets in here, but it's about a cultural shift away from people being inflexible, and not looking for new and fresh ideas about how people can engage in the workplace," she said. Rayner shrugged off suggestions that she has been at loggerheads with Keir Starmer – or could even challenge him for the leadership, as some supporters had urged her to do before the Batley and Spen byelection earlier this month. "Me and Keir have been working incredibly closely together since the start of the pandemic," she said, comparing the day when they were both elected in the depths of the first lockdown to "an arranged marriage, almost, by telephone". "We bring different things to that leadership. And I think that works," she said, calling them "yin and yang". Labour's loss of the Hartlepool constituency in May sparked panic about Starmer's prospects of leading Labour to a general election victory, with some MPs quietly casting around for a candidate who could gather the 40 signatures necessary to mount a challenge. But his leadership has appeared more secure since the party held the Yorkshire seat of Batley and Spen. Rayner said she and Starmer had different approaches. "You know, my style is more robust as people know: I'm more bombastic, in the way in which do things, I say it how I see it: and therefore I bring that freshness to the partnership." "Keir's very forensic, he's very intelligent. He's very passionate about making sure that the country is a better place," she said. Rayner has spoken in the past about growing up in poverty, and becoming a carer for her mother, who struggled with mental illness, from the age of 10. "I like to think I overshare and Keir undershares," she said. "If you look at Keir's background, it's not dissimilar for mine: he looked after his mum, I looked after my mum," she says. "Keir wasn't from a privileged background". Challenged about a dip in Labour's membership, Rayner said she was focused on voters. "Of course we want to attract people to be members of the Labour party, but what we need to do is we need to attract voters as well. And what we're doing is we're speaking to the country: we're saying that actually we don't want to be an opposition, we want to be a government," she said. Labour is in the process of laying off up to 90 staff via voluntary redundancies, as Starmer seeks to repair the party's shattered finances after costly election battles and a string of legal cases. The former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott criticised Labour this week for simultaneously seeking to hire staff on six-month contracts to handle a backlog of complaints against members. "So Keir will make Britain the best place to work – unless you work for Labour," Abbott tweeted. Rayner rejected that, highlighting the importance of ensuring the party is financially viable. "We don't want to be making staff redundant. It's an awful situation but

As Starmer's parliamentary private secretary, her job will be to liaise between backbenchers and the leader's office. Some MPs have complained in recent weeks that they felt neglected by Starmer's team. Hodgson will also bring understanding of the north-east, where Labour lost the Hartlepool byelection last week, and the Midlands are said to be concerned by the concerns of some backbench MPs. The shadow party secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was time to "grow up", and that it would take on a different role in the coming months. "The mayor of London is right to be concerned about where our support base is, where our commitment to change is, and where the leadership is," Ashworth said. "We have got to change, and that has got to be much more robust than we have in the past, because we are very reliant on outside donors to get us through this year." In a separate interview with Sophy Ridge on Sky News, responding to Rayner's criticism of her handling of the scandal, Ashworth said her job was to "pull the mayor together by building connections in the north and south". "Building connections in the form that she does is something that she is absolutely right on – but it requires a very strong foundation," he said. "I think ultimately what mayor [Matt] Ryan is trying to do is build on the work of the last great Tory government, like the 1997 government did, and they've done an outstanding job." Reed, the former shadow chancellor, was widely seen as a potential successor to Matt Hancock, or at least a relatable candidate, in a Blair-like successor to the mayoralty. But ministers were baffled on Friday about why the mayor of London had not been asked to do more press, and Baker's intervention has also raised the question of whether the UK can rest easier with more moneyed voters.

<|startofarticle|>  Jeremy Corbyn's supporters reacted with fury after news of a young mother being snapped kissing a member of staff leaked to the press, as the Labour leader announced Labour would legislate to prevent staff from kissing members in public. The idea, which was in the 2019 manifesto, was the latest element of Labour's "new deal for working people" campaign, as well as a part of that party's annual conference speech next week. Locklear, the MP for Belper, who was born in Derby, was introduced to the Labour party through the Thatcherite era. She was a youth MP in the 2010 general election, winning the support of the party's ruling national executive committee (NEC), which met once a week at its conference. During the course of a debate on free school meals, for example, Corbyn claimed: "Nothing is more important than spreading what works, embedding high-quality and inspirational teaching and learning, and adapting a curriculum that provides motivation to our members at every stage, wherever they are in life." Liz Kendall, the shadow education secretary, was less complacent, saying: "Nothing can be more important than spreading what works." The Labour leader was openly asked about the issue by Matt Hancock at the weekend, after his departure from the shadow cabinet, when news first hit that Labour was considering a fresh set of seats for a leadership challenge.  After the exchange, Johnson cut short the planned return to the House of Commons to cut to government short a lengthy explanation of the crisis the family veteran was in. "I think what people want to hear is what plans we have," he said, adding: "What I want to hear is that Labour is prepared to take on this government and step up to the challenge of the 21st century." Johnson was cheered by his own MPs at the start of his appearance, after a turbulent three-week period that included several backbench rebellions and some senior Tories expressing concern about his competence. He began the week with a routine message of "the best start I can find" – breaking with convention to announce the creation of a new "red list" of foreign agents who "may be relevant to the conduct of our work". He then moved to bar MPs from Twitter feeds critical of the government, including the wartime prime minister, Tony Blair. Speaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Johnson was asked about Blair's response on a day when Labour MPs were being urged to abstain from voting on the deal. "He said: 'I don't think that's the way forward,' before then initially offering his own recollection of the day. He then continued to make attempts to detract from the discussion, eventually coming up empty, before voting against the deal. That's the way forward – vote against it and we will not have a Labour government." Johnson's latest comments came as Johnson said he was "optimistic" about the future of the civil service and that he had been surprised by the scale of the backlash against his last-minute political moves.

Hodgson, the MP for Washington and Sunderland West since 2010, replaces Carolyn Harris, who resigned earlier this week amid claims that she had stoked up tensions between Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner.  As Starmer's parliamentary private secretary, her job will be to liaise between backbenchers and the leader's office. Some MPs have complained in recent weeks that they felt neglected by Starmer's team. Hodgson will also bring understanding of the north-east, where Labour lost the Hartlepool byelection last week, and the West Yorkshire byelection on 27 December. The Labour leader will meet Conservative MPs on a drive through the most deprived areas on Monday, with the aid of a newly made 'star' app called MakeInNow. It is understood the aide will arrive in the Carlisle constituency of Symonds – the seat held by the disgraced former minister James Brokenshire.  Changes were made to the media policy last week, including the removal of the former Katy Clark interview, which criticised the former Progressive Conservative party leader, Michael Gove. Clark took aim at Cummings in a lengthy blogpost published last week, in which he sought to discredit the speech and the role of the MP. "You are the puppet that Keir Starmer has been working towards ensuring has a majority of 3,500," he declared in the Observer. "As an elected representative, I seek to advance the cause of public services throughout the country and the world. As an elected representative, I seek to advance the cause of common ownership of public assets. And yours, you can do whatever you want."

<|startofarticle|>  Jeremy Corbyn has pledged to campaign against the arrival of Rupert Murdoch's News UK television channel as he launched his Peace and Justice Project at an online rally. A more "just, free and accountable" media is one of four causes Corbyn is encouraging his supporters to back. He also urged them to help with organising direct support in communities, such as food banks; campaign for a green new deal; and press the government to speed up the delivery of Covid vaccines in developing countries.  "So many of the ideas we need to make the 2020s better than the 2010s were developed in and around the Labour party in recent years, by outstanding thinkers, but more importantly by demands of our movements, and the skills, knowledge and needs of the communities affected," Corbyn said. "We will build on these policies, taking them further, adapting them to the post-pandemic world, so that our movement can turn the dial towards peace and justice." Corbyn was readmitted to the Labour party in November, after being suspended over remarks he made when the Equality and Human Rights Commission published its critical report on the party's handling of antisemitism. But his successor as leader, Keir Starmer, declined to restore the Labour whip to Corbyn, who now sits as an independent MP. The broadcasting regulator, Ofcom, gave the go-ahead last month to Murdoch's right-leaning news channel, which is expected to be on air for four to five hours a night. It is expected to compete with Andrew Neil's GB News, with the pair racing to be the first on air. Corbyn repeatedly criticised the role of the media in public life during his time as leader of the opposition. He was ridiculed in some of Murdoch's newspapers, with the Sun's front page on election day in 2017 urging its readers: "Don't chuck Britain in the Cor-bin." Corbyn gave a lecture at the Edinburgh television festival in 2018 calling for a taxpayer-owned British Digital Corporation to offset the power of multinational corporations in the media, though the policy never found its way into Labour's manifesto. His digital rally also featured Greece's former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis and the Labour MP for Coventry South, Zarah Sultana. The new initiative will not be signing up members but Corbyn hopes to play a convening role in bringing together activists, trade unions and other leftwing groups. Setting out the aims of his new political venture, he appeared to take a sideswipe at his successor, saying: "If you refuse to argue for your side, our opponents win by default." Some of Corbyn's allies believe Starmer has not been sufficiently robust in attacking Boris Johnson's government – and fear backsliding from some of the radical policies set out in the 2019 general election manifesto. Starmer has adopted the slogan "a new leadership" to differentiate his tenure from Corbyn's four-and-a-half-year period at the top of the party.
