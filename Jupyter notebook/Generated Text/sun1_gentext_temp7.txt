<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson told Emmanuel Macron to "get a grip" last night as he compared France's new law to the Berlin Wall being used to justify the bailing out of Nazi Germany. The new European Arrest Warrant is meant to stop European countries agreeing to join Britain's plan to turn away from gas. It permits police to arrest European migrants when they pass through English Channel waters, but not when they are not tested. Britain will next week unveil a set of minimum conditions for migrants who tested positive in the past. They will be slapped on the shelf for five years after their crimes are caught and they return to crime families. But Mr Johnson said: "We will be looking at the whole package of conditions... we will be slapping on the shelf for five years after the fact." And he suggested the EU could join the new pact quicker than that. He said: "We will be looking at the whole package of conditions. "It will be something that we will look at carefully and decide, but it is a process and it will be a complex one and we will be looking at all the details absolutely. "But our point is that at the moment what we are looking at is a very good solution and that is why we are inviting other countries into the trade deal. "So moving forward, it is very important that we are moving cautiously. "And not just the traditional borders. We have to be able to talk to people in other countries. We have to be able to come into hotels. "But the gateway to America is a good, secure U.S. border. "It is a partnership for 500 million people. The fastest way to reach America is to have a border-crossing event in another country. "This is a great way to reach America and the fastest way to reach America is to have a border-crossing event in a third country. "And we are working on plans to get around the world quicker. We are working on plans to get around the world quicker. But at the moment, it is a partnership for 500 million people." AAPL is already being used to speed up the global rollout of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

<|startofarticle|> WHITEHALL chiefs have rebuked civil servants for not returning to their desks ahead of the UK-US travel ban. Many have been worried by the hostile takeover of the Global Trade War Council, a right-wing think tank. Last month the PM told the Inter-Parliamentary Group on Civil Society: "We will need members to know the UK is a destination for business, individuals can go for socialising and food, and the social distancing is just too much. "We are clear we would not want our members to be subject to such intimidation." But last week the Government was forced to admit the "reality of the situation" but insisted "we are not going back to the same old broken model with low wages, low growth, low skills and low productivity." The group's boss, Sir Wilfred Owen, added: "No one wants to work with skills gaps, skills that go beyond sight. "We are ready to work with anyone." The travel ban is a key plank of the EU and US trade deals. But ministers have been kept in the dark for months by the Home Office over their true true true colours amid the blazing rows over the UK's climate change. Last night the TUC voted 91-9 to block the planned penultimate phase of the deal. The Inter-Parliamentary Group on Civil Society agreed: "The ban on lobbying and the summary destruction of property are both punishments which must be punished." But the government's Brexit plan would likely wreck that deal. The group's boss, Mark Harper, said: "This is simply more lobbying and destruction of social distancing. Punishment enough." He added: "The Government can work with any country it wishes but it cannot join with anyone else in the world." TUC Brexit spokeswoman Lisa Tremble said: "The UK's greatest ally continues to deny the climate change we need and deserve."

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson will today hand 800,000 doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab to Kenya, The Sun can reveal. The UK's key ally in the East Africa has currently only vaccinated about 2 per cent of its population so far. Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta flew into London last night with the pair due to meet at Chequers this afternoon where they will announce the life-saving gift. The AZ jabs are make up the first tranche of 100 million doses the UK vowed to share with poorer countries at June's G7 through the global Covax programme. It's understood other countries set to received doses from Britain will be unveiled in the coming weeks, with Mr Johnson promising the UK will donate 5 million doses by the end of September. The UK helped to establish the international Covax jab effort last year and is its fourth-biggest donor, pledging £548 million to the scheme. Last night a senior government source said: "It's right that as the UK continues our world-beating vaccine rollout at home, we support other countries to get the pandemic under control. "No one is safe from this virus until we're all safe."

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson's hopes of getting all schools back in mid-September have been dashed by an "unwillingness to compromise". Cabinet ministers refuse to say whether Mr Johnson will unveil his November Plan — promising it willcel-warrior veterans his first day in power. And he says he will only "administer" if the government is up to "the task". Proponents of the plan say it will slash the level of b-i-b-link in schools and libraries and make it easier for kids to get their hands on the latest version of the bad boy. Critics say it will confuse and confuse the kids, causing confusion in schools and putting pressure on teachers to get the kids to return to classrooms. It has also caused a rift in the Government where one minister Jack Doyle is now backing Keir Starmer's Progressive Conservative Party, who are not newbies in Government. One senior Tory source said: "It's madness. "Sir Keir Starmer's Tories are old hat, old guard and will do anything to get us out of this situation. "If they think they can get us out of it they are wrong. We are in rebellion and we are out of options. "If they push us out, punish us or take our children away from them then we will become the enemy."

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson told Joe Biden his election as US President has "sparked a mood of optimism in the world that American leadership is back". The Sun can also reveal they joked about who had pinched their shared "build back better" slogan from who and bonded over their mutual love of trains. The PM beat his fellow European leaders to the first call with the new White House chief. The pair, who have never met, spent nearly 40 minutes getting to know each other on Saturday night. Mr Biden, who some have suggested harboured a dislike of Mr Johnson because of Brexit, is understood to have reaffirmed that the UK is "the US's closest ally". The PM pointed out that a million Americans work for British firms across the pond, and a million Brits work for US firms UK as the reality of that bond. When Mr Johnson won his massive election victory in 2019, Mr Biden publicly called the PM a "clone" of Donald Trump. But Downing Street said yesterday the call was "warm and friendly". However on a darker note they both agreed climate change posed an "existential threat" to our way of life. And they vowed to put green issues at the top of their shared agenda ahead of the UK hosting the major COP21 climate summit in November that Mr Biden is likely to attend. He is also expected in Britain in the summer for the G7. But No10 left the door open to Mr Johnson jetting to Washington before then to meet the new US President, saying: "The leaders looked forward to meeting in person as soon as the circumstances allow."

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson's government appears to have made a decision not to bring forward Ms Symonds to head his Cabinet as planned, The Sun can reveal. The Prime Minister's official spokesman insisted that the decision was made "in consultation with the Ministry of Defence". The only confirmed case of way to bring forward Ms Symonds is with the Foreign and Business Departments. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: "This news brings us closer to a deal which will bring us closer to freedom and democracy for Britain." The top official added: "The British Armed Forces and the international community are now able to say 'yes' to a solution and we are ready to work with anyone who wants to achieve that outcome." Sources believe the Prime Minister may also be able to join Cabinet in future. The Official Opposition are demanding a change of guard at No10 so they can work with any new government. The PM has been under pressure to back the reshuffle after his team declined. Critics said the move was a once in a generation opportunity to "celebrate" the new administration and give the country a proud welcome back. Some branded it "an opportunity to work with whoever you want to work with and have a blast!" Boris Johnson had hoped to spend a bit of his day "dingding" with the spin king, but the soaring poll also revealed he was falling short of his vow. Just 19 per cent said they wanted him to continue to serve in No10. The Tories hit a historic high in 2021/22, when Boris was 19 per cent, and just 6 per cent wanted him to stay at the helm. The PM had been hoping to use his premiership to "tip the scales back" against China, the rogue state that stole the show in the 2016 People's War cybercrackdown. Instead, he is set to face accusations from independence minded Tories of using his premiership to undermine parliamentary investigations. The latest Coronavirus measures have been blamed at the Home Office, the Defence Command and Staff, the Office of National Statistics and the Home Office. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson today unveiled a massive raid on shareholder profits to raise billions for the NHS and Social Care. The PM today revealed a 1.25 per cent hike to National Insurance contributors from workers and firms today - as well as a new tax assault on investors. Cabinet sources say people paid in dividends will be exempt from the new tax, but the total to be paid out in the UK Cash has been raised by the Treasury and administered by the UK Government. The PM says: "We have also included contingency costs in the calculation of the overall cost of doing business, which will be included in the overall national debt." "This additional funding will help us continue to help the UK achieve our social care dream of a free and fair world." The move will trigger an extra £30billion in new tax revenues, bringing the UK's national debt to more than £50billion. It is the equivalent to bringing the national debt equivalent of adding 250 cars on the road. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> ARMED police and troops could be drafted in to protect Britain's vital vaccine stocks after hospital chiefs warned anti-vaxxers could target sites administering the jab. Yesterday Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed "a role for the armed forces" in distributing the antidote. The Sun can reveal Health bosses have raised concerns anti-vaccine protests may target unprepared hospitals with mass demonstrations or even attempts to destroy stockpiles. NHS Trusts are liaising with Whitehall over a role for the police or even the Army in protecting the supply chains. Particular concern has been raised by the first hospitals in London that plan to begin vaccinating frontline health workers as soon as any vaccine is given the greenlight. A Whitehall source said: "They are liaising with the police and even the army over a number of security concerns." Yesterday Mr Hancock told the BBC: "We're doing the logistical work - led by the NHS working with the armed services who are playing an important role in the logistics of it to ensure that we have that rollout programme ready." Clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccines are ongoing. CORONAVIRUS  infections are falling in some of the worst-hit areas — offering hope that lockdown measures are working. The rate in Liverpool fell from 620 cases per 100,000 people to 520 in just a week — with 2,591 new cases in the seven days to October 3. It was one of the first areas put under a Tier 3 lockdown. In Knowsley, Merseyside, also in Tier 3, the rate fell from 682 to 599, with 905 new cases. And the rate in Nottingham, which will go into Tier 3 on October 4, fell from 726 to 464, with 1,546 new cases. Rates also decreased in Newcastle and Exeter. The Public Health England data, released yesterday, covers the seven days to October 3, and is based on laboratory tests. It comes as 102 more people died from the virus, bringing the total to 44,998. Cases continued to rise for most of the country, with a further 20,890 reported. It is too early to know if Tier 3 lockdowns in some areas, such as Manchester and South Yorkshire, have been effective in curbing the number of new cases. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson's government appeared to chide Nicola Sturgeon for letting the side down with Scotland's slow vaccination pace last night. And ministers offered to help "accelerate" the pace north of the border with more resources from the UK government - in a move that risked infuriating the nationalists. As the UK hit the ten million jabs mark, the Westminster government wrote to the SNP boss to say "it is in everyone's interests that progress in vaccinating the people of Scotland matches the best efforts of the rest of UK". Scottish Secretary Alister Jack added: "With that in mind, we stand ready to offer any support or assistance we can give you to accelerate your rollout programme." Of the 4.4million adults in Scotland to be vaccinated, so far 610,778 have received the first jab. However Ms Sturgeon accepted that her government did want to "accelerate the overall progress" of the campaign. She reported to MSPs that just under 35,000 first doses were administered on Monday - the highest daily total so far, and 55 per cent more than the number of injections given on the same day last week. But Scottish Conservative Holyrood leader Ruth Davidson noted that on Sunday January 31, "Scotland saw the lowest number of jabs administered since the start of the mass rollout over a month ago". She hit out at the First Minister and said: "At the moment, all the evidence shows the Scottish government's rollout is slow, stuttering and lagging way behind the rest of the UK." While just over a fifth of 75-79-year-olds in Scotland have been vaccinated, Ms Davidson said that was "just a quarter of the proportion vaccinated south of the border" for the same age group. The Scottish government's rollout is slow, stuttering and lagging way behind the rest of the UK. Mr Jack urged Ms Sturgeon to accept assistance, saying: "I strongly believe that to put the nightmare of Covid-19 behind us as quickly as possible, we must collaborate as closely as possible." Ms Sturgeon insisted that going forward the number of injections given will increase "as we make more use of mass vaccination centres for the younger age groups". Two new mass vaccination centres opened in Scotland on Monday, in Edinburgh and Aberdeen. The First Minister said: "I'm not standing here denying we want to accelerate the overall progress." "But nor will I apologise for having deliberately focused on maximising uptake in the most clinically vulnerable groups." Cabinet Minister Jacob Rees Mogg said the offer of help was a clear sign of the "benefits of the United Kingdom". 
====================
<|startofarticle|> LABOUR'S Lisa Nandy was at the centre of a "woke" row last night after attacking Boris Johnson for defending Sir Winston Churchill. The Shadow Foreign Secretary compared racist protests in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017 to the PM criticising left-wing hooligans who defaced a statue of Britain's wartime hero. And she accused him trying to start a "culture war" like Donald Trump who stirred up the 2017 race riot. Ms Nandy said: "Two years later we had the prime minister here trying to start a culture war over a statue of Churchill". In an interview with the Guardian newspaper, Ms Nandy also accused the PM of attacking trans rights in the "same pattern of behaviour". But last night Mr Johnson hit back that its always right "to stick up for your history, your traditions and your values." Labour boss Sir Keir Starmer is under pressure to distance himself from his key frontbench ally's incendiary comments. A senior Tory source hit out: "Labour may think it's wrong to stand up to mobs attacking a statue of our great wartime leader, but we do not." The added: "The Conservatives will always stand up for our culture, history and traditions." And later Mr Johnson said: "There's nothing wrong with being woke." But he added: "I put myself in the category of people who believe that it's important to stick up for your history, your traditions and your values, the things you believe in." LISA Nandy is becoming a liability for Keir Starmer's Labour. First the shadow foreign secretary hints that her leader should somehow become MORE "woke" to get elected. Then she tries to equate Boris Johnson's anger over Winston Churchill's statue being vandalised with Trump backing white supremacists. Good luck selling that one to Red Wall voters. It is ironic to see Nandy baselessly accusing the PM of stoking a "culture war" when she devotes so much of her energies to sowing partisan division. She must be confident of her majority in Wigan. Voters in other working-class seats read her woke witterings and weep. In the midst of the row, Mr Johnson declined to comment on whether he believed new President Joe Biden was "woke." He told Sky News: "What I know is that he's a firm believer in the transatlantic alliance and that's a great thing. "And a believer in a lot of the things that we want to achieve together."

<|startofarticle|> RISHI Sunak will triple education funding for disabled children in Wednesday's Spending Review, The Sun can reveal. A pot of £2.6billion has been earmarked to help create more than 30,000 specialist school places over the next three years. The cash marks a major win for our Give It Back campaign, that has been arguing against Government cuts to support for disabled kids. Last night, the Chancellor thanked the thousands of Sun readers who joined our call. He said: "I welcome The Sun and its readers campaigning on important issues around special educational needs and disabilities. "I want every child to have the best possible start in life and to fulfil their potential." Mr Sunak will also use his Budget to announce a network of "family hubs" which will offer

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson is facing a growing rebellion from his own soldiers ahead of his Test and Trace Force. The Prime Minister is preparing a major tour of Afghanistan that could last weeks - with some calling the move a mistake and others saying it's a good idea. Last week, the Select Committee on Intelligence said it did not believe the move was wise because it would compromise intelligence. But a senior government minister told The Sun: "There is a risk that you end up with a report that contains the truth, but we think it's worth going through the details carefully because we think it's a very difficult thing to do." The Select Committee is the independent agency that advises the Government on foreign policy. It has already been forced into action against alleged leaker of sensitive National Security Agency (NSA) communications about bin Laden's whereabouts. The White House considered Adm. Mike Mullen well known figure for his tough talk but the choice was made for political reasons. The Select Committee is being kept in the dark because of the sensitive nature of the case against him, but it should be strong - and General Mark Shirman, the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has indicated he is not going to be back before the summer. Mr Shirman was reported by the Sunday Times to have been resigning his position over the spying scandal as the Joint Chiefs of Staff looked into the claims of spying. But The Sun understands senior figures in the defence and state departments backed up that report, with Mr Johnson confident that protecting national security was the priority. Mr Johnson will also be attending a summit of the G7 finance ministers in Cornwall this morning to announce the latest investment in Britain's defence. THE health secretary has been at the centre of lurid briefing wars between himself and his senior figures. It has been an unusual course of events for a Home Secretary, given that her career at the heart of the NHS is her Cabinet. But it is not the first time anyone from the Home Secretary's Office has been at the centre of a row. BACKLASH: The Home Office's new chief medic has been accused of being a right-wing conspiracy theorist. His defence has been "exceptionally poor" given that he is not a medic himself. SAGE member and former MP John Redwood has written to Mr Johnson to demand that he withdraw his honours. He said: "As a former police officer I stand by my profession and my values. I voted for the Partick government because they were able to give me the honours I needed to continue to serve my country." He added: "The system doesn't do enough to you to ensure you will continue to work for the Government. "I know this is the wrong message to send but the Government should be proud of the sacrifices you have made and the sacrifices of the NHS as a service to the people of Scotland." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson and Carrie Symonds will "celebrate their wedding" next summer, The Sun can reveal. The Prime Minister, 56, and his fiancée, 33, have sent save-the-date cards to family and friends for a lavish bash on Saturday, July 30, 2022. The couple got engaged in late 2019 but, like thousands of other loved-up Brits, have had to delay plans because of Covid. Details of exactly where the couple will say "I do" remain a closely guarded secret, but pals say they are waiting until next year for a big celebration to be on the safe side. BoJo is expected to announce that the lockdown cap of 30 guests at weddings will be lifted next month. However, friends of the couple say the fight against the virus, and getting the country bouncing back from the pandemic, means this summer is too soon for their big knees-up. Early contenders as a location for the party include the PM's country pile Chequers in Buckinghamshire, or the Port Lympne safari park in Kent, where Carrie works. Last night a spokesman for the couple declined to comment on a "private family event". The only other PM to marry in office was Lord Liverpool who wed Mary Chester in 1822. Boris and Carrie were first seen together at a 2018 fundraiser. They have already become the first unmarried couple to live in Downing Street, moving there in July 2019. He reportedly proposed on holiday on the Caribbean island of Mustique, shortly after his landslide victory at December 2019's General Election. Commons sleazebusters are currently probing who exactly paid for the five-star trip amid a donations row. The engagement — and news that Carrie was expecting their first child — was announced publicly in late February 2020. The pandemic hit weeks later and the PM faced an intensive-care battle with Covid that April. Son Wilfred was born on April 29, 2020, and given the middle name Nicholas after two doctors who saved the PM's life. Mr Johnson has since remained tight-lipped about his wedding plans. Asked this March if he would be tying the knot when lockdown restrictions lift fully, the PM would only say to The Sun: "The wedding industry is certainly going to come roaring back in common with many other sectors of the economy." News of the pending nuptials will spark plenty of speculation about where the biggest political wedding in decades will be held. Wilfred was christened at Westminster Cathedral in central London in September. Boris also has access to Chequers, used by Prime Ministers as a retreat since the 1920s, and 40 miles from No10. He quit as Foreign Secretary in July 2018, days after a meeting at the estate in which then-PM Theresa May urged her warring Cabinet to hammer out a Brexit plan. Boris also used Chequers' 1,500 acres to convalesce following his virus battle. A source told The Sun tonight: "It would be nice for Chequers to be in the news for happy reasons for once." Looking to read more on the Prime Minister's life? We have you covered... The Port Lympne Reserve and hotel in Kent is also thought to be in the running for next summer's bash. Carrie works for conservation charity the Aspinall Foundation that runs the zoo, home to giraffes, zebras, rhinos and gorillas. The vast reserve also hosts quirky weddings as well as safari tours. Mr Johnson's own country house in his former constituency of Henley, Oxfordshire, could easily have played host to the bash — but it was recently rented out. Commons registers show the farmhouse near Thame is bringing in at least £10,000 a year in rental income. One estate agent's advert offers it for £4,250 a week. The PM also shares a farm and land in Devon with his siblings but it is not thought to be under consideration for the wedding. It had previously been reported that the pair could marry in Italy, where Carrie has relatives. But pals said that would be impractical with travel restrictions for a large party. Another option for the couple could be No10 Downing Street itself. It has plenty of vast state rooms and a large garden that could easily fit hundreds of guests. THE wedding will be the third for Boris — and Carrie's first. He tied the knot with first wife Allegra Mostyn-Owen in 1987. That marriage was annulled in 1993 — the same year he married Marina Wheeler. The couple had four children but separated in 2018. They formally divorced weeks before news emerged of Boris's engagement to Carrie. The only other PM to marry in office was Lord Liverpool who wed Mary Chester in 1822. His first wife Louisa, 54, died the previous year. Boris is also thought to be the first PM to divorce in office since Augustus FitzRoy, the 3rd Duke of Grafton. An act of Parliament allowed him to leave first wife Anne in 1769. He went on to marry Elizabeth W
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson has ordered health chiefs to simplify complex local lockdown rules within days after widespread confusion. Echoing his streamlining of social mixing regulations into a simpler "rule of six" the PM wants to implement a new tier system for threat level as soon as possible. Officials are working around the clock to flesh out the clearer system after the PM and his ministers were humiliated on the airwaves over their own confusion at the rules that can vary town to town. Each threat level would have different restrictions linked to them, based on the number of local cases. Areas with around 100 cases per 100,000 would qualify for tier one status according to an early draft of the plan and see greater enforcement of social distancing and mask wearing. But if cases rose above that, such as in the North, then they would be classed as Tier 2 and see bans on household gatherings. If that failed to work, areas could hit Tier 3 and be placed in to a more extreme form of lockdown that could see pubs, restaurants and shops ordered to shut in order to keep schools and other workplaces open Last night the Department of Health insisted that no changes to the local lockdown measures were imminent, but Downing Street did not deny the plan. No10 insisted: "We keep all of the measures which we put in place under review - if there is anything further to set out then we will do so to the House". The move will allow some areas of the country currently hit by severe lockdown measures to be granted more freedom to mingle. Mr Johnson is expected to unveil the changes next week after signing them off with his Cabinet as soon as this weekend. It comes after another raft of local measures were brought in for Liverpool, Middlesbrough, Hartlepool & Warrington. Today's news means around 20 million people across the UK are now living under local lockdown restrictions. The Government has been criticised of having patchwork systems of local restrictions which no one can understand. Even Mr Johnson stumbled over what the rules were in the North East, after mixing with other households indoors and in pubs became illegal. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for a "rapid review" of the local lockdown strategy. Sir Keir said yesterday: "One of the major problems, is widespread confusion about the local restrictions." Conservative Bolton council leader David Greenhalgh, where restrictions were relaxed slightly today, said the rules have become "too complex and too complicated".

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson has been warned Sinn Fein will sweep to power in Northern Ireland and break up republics if he does. DUP heavyweight Ian Paisley Jr says further delay will only "embolden republicans in the Republic and those who want to rip us out of the United Kingdom." Britain is at loggerheads with Brussels over the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol that forces checks on goods travelling from the mainland to Ulster. Mr Johnson is said to be "increasingly frustrated" with the "systemic breakdown of order in Northern Ireland" that has seen journalists and many government scientists forced into long queues at counters. There are fears the problems will end with the signing of the treaty, which will give the EU wide berth to deploy lethal bean counters across the UK. But polls by Opinium have Sinn Fein ahead of the UK taking the historic step of actually ratifying the treaty. The Centre For Brexit Policy who commissioned the poll said: "On the supremacy of the British Parliament, the confidence of the PM will be crucial."

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson and Rishi Sunak will slash the UK's bloated foreign aid budget to fill the Covid blackhole, No10 all but confirmed today. As The Sun revealed in August, the Chancellor has his eyes on the hallowed cash  — up to £15billion a year — to help plug the budget black hole caused by the virus. Britain is legally bound to spend 0.7 per cent of output on foreign giveaways, but on Tuesday Downing Street said the law allows that pledge to be suspended in extreme times. Mr Johnson's spokesman said: "There may be circumstances in which the government is not able to meet 0.7% commitment – if that happens a Secretary of State has to lay a statement in parliament." The massive hint came after Cabinet Minister Robert Jenrick said the Covid crisis meant that "there is a legitimate question for us to ask at this moment in time whether or not it would be wise to spend somewhat less in light of the fact public finances are in a really challenging situation." The commitment to spend 0.7p per cent of British GDP on foreign giveaways was a flagship policy for former PM David Cameron, who used to try "modernise" the Conservatives. But it's always been loathed by many senior Tories who resented foreign aid swelling even amid cuts to domestic spending and having their hands tied by the arbitrary figure. Although he is understood to have the backing of the PM for the move, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is pushing back on the measure. In September his department took over the Aid department and he has fought back against any attempt to divert funds ever since. When unveiling the merger in June, Boris Johnson warned the UK's aid budget would no longer be a "giant cash point in the sky" for countries like India and China. Mr Johnson has also signalled support for ripping  up rules on aid spending Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. He said instead the focus should be on how to use aid spending to  "maximise British influence" on the world stage. And while planned slashing of the aid budget would infuriate the charities and opposition parties it would delight scores of Conservative MPs who have hated it for a decade. Jeremy Hutton, a policy analyst for the Taxpayer Alliance, said: "It's about time ministers made use of this aid loophole. "As we've long said, the law does allow the aid budget to be slashed in a crisis. "The Covid pandemic gives Whitehall more than enough wiggle room to do the right thing and ensure taxpayers' money stays at home. "Well done to Rishi for exploring all the avenues available to cut back wasteful spending and balance the books." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson is facing the wrath of Scottish fishermen as Brexit border pressure starts to bite. Scots fishermen say new bureaucracy makes exporting to Europe all but impossible for fresh seafood, leaving shellfish rotting at Dover. Yesterday Downing Street promised £100 million in compensation to those businesses blighted by the changing rules "by no fault of their own". The row was worsened after fishing minister Victoria Prentis admitted she has not read Mr Johnson's EU deal causing the changes. The bungling Tory claimed to have been "very busy on Christmas Eve" when the agreement came through, "organising the local nativity trail". Yesterday Environment Secretary George Eustice insisted to MPs the issue can be quickly resolved. He told the Commons: "They are only teething problems, once people get used to using the paperwork goods will flow normally." But Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross said financial compensation is "clearly needed by our fishermen right across the country". During an urgent question on the matter in the Commons on Thursday, MPs from all parties voiced their concerns about exports of Scottish seafood from smaller companies being halted for a further five days by transport company DFDS. DFDS stopped exports last week after delays in getting new paperwork introduced following the expiry of the Brexit transition period for EU border posts in France. Paperwork has to be approved before consignments can be sent to DFDS's warehouse in South Lanarkshire and then on to English Channel ports. Liberal Democrat MP Alistair Carmichael described the situation as "a shambles of the Government's own making".

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson's government appeared to chide Nicola Sturgeon for letting the side down with Scotland's slow vaccination pace last night. And ministers offered to help "accelerate" the pace north of the border with more resources from the UK government - in a move that risked infuriating the nationalists. As the UK hit the ten million jabs mark, the Westminster government wrote to the SNP boss to say "it is in everyone's interests that progress in vaccinating the people of Scotland matches the best efforts of the rest of UK". Scottish Secretary Alister Jack added: "With that in mind, we stand ready to offer any support or assistance we can give you to accelerate your rollout programme." Of the 4.4million adults in Scotland to be vaccinated, so far 610,778 have received the first jab. However Ms Sturgeon accepted that her government did want to "accelerate the overall progress" of the campaign. She reported to MSPs that just under 35,000 first doses were administered on Monday - the highest daily total so far, and 55 per cent more than the number of injections given on the same day last week. But Scottish Conservative Holyrood leader Ruth Davidson noted that on Sunday January 31, "Scotland saw the lowest number of jabs administered since the start of the mass rollout over a month ago". She hit out at the First Minister and said: "At the moment, all the evidence shows the Scottish government's rollout is slow, stuttering and lagging way behind the rest of the UK." While just over a fifth of 75-79-year-olds in Scotland have been vaccinated, Ms Davidson said that was "just a quarter of the proportion vaccinated south of the border" for the same age group. The Scottish government's rollout is slow, stuttering and lagging way behind the rest of the UK. Mr Jack urged Ms Sturgeon to accept assistance, saying: "I strongly believe that to put the nightmare of Covid-19 behind us as quickly as possible, we must collaborate as closely as possible." Ms Sturgeon insisted that going forward the number of injections given will increase "as we make more use of mass vaccination centres for the younger age groups". Two new mass vaccination centres opened in Scotland on Monday, in Edinburgh and Aberdeen. The First Minister said: "I'm not standing here denying we want to accelerate the overall progress." "But nor will I apologise for having deliberately focused on maximising uptake in the most clinically vulnerable groups." Cabinet Minister Jacob Rees Mogg said the offer of help was a clear sign of the "benefits of the United Kingdom".

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson has offered up Britain's stadiums for the whole European Championships as the UK's vaccine roll-out surges ahead of the continent — and he can't wait to raise a pint to the prospect. The football tournament's semi-finals and final are already pencilled in for Wembley in July but temporary teetotaller Mr Johnson said last night: "Any other matches they want hosted, we are certainly on for that!" It could kick-start a "bonanza" decade of footy, with Chancellor Rishi Sunak set to pump millions into funding the UK and Ireland's joint pitch to host the 2030 World Cup in tomorrow's Budget. In an exclusive interview with The Sun, the Prime Minister said: "We are very, very keen to bring football home in 2030. I do think it's the right place. "It's the home of football, it's the right time. It will be an absolutely wonderful thing for the country." Mr Johnson hopes the image of plucky Brexit Britain, fresh from its vaccine success, hosting the European tournament this summer would be a great advert for the UK's 2030 bid. And he hopes it will encourage us all to play more sport so the country can "build back fitter" from Covid. The PM admitted he is gasping for a pint at his local to toast the possibility of greater Euros involvement just as soon as the pubs are allowed to start serving again. Admitting he is currently "on the wagon", Mr Johnson said not being able to have a tipple during lockdown had been "a nightmare". He said that he would "line up" the Trojans, Greens, Greensades in particular and see "no resistance" from Labour. "But obviously we are all sort of lining up to do that so please get in there and support, first thing, the NHS. "We are ready to go in any virus, any infection, any vaccine. "If there's one thing I want to emphasise, it's that I think we all want to get into all sorts of settings to get into." Musk said he would love the Olympics to bring back gorillas "as soon as possible" but added: "We don't want them to be used as an entertainment medium." He added: "I hope they do but I don't want them to be used as a weapon of mass destruction." In a split, Sir Simon directly criticised government doctors Professor Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance's use of the term "gong" in their proposals for allowing live gorillas to gong together. The former justice minister told the Commons on Tuesday that "overt and outright racism" would never be tolerated in Britain. "I have no doubt that if we continue forward with plans for live gorillas we will accelerate the removal of white rhinos as we move into the pandemic era," he added. The proposals came after a weekend of bad blood between the two Cabinet ministers. After Mr Williamson threatened to cut the UK out of the whole world refugee agency, Dr Whitty insisted: "I don't want a zero-rate country to become a zero-rate country." Meanwhile, the UK government's decision to accept 5,000 Syrian asylum claims during the first phase of the UK's plan to get Britain out of the EU was condemned by Lord Brown. He said: "It is precisely because of the price of production — as well as the fact that it is polluting — that is the price of survival."

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson and Carrie Symonds will set out their plans for the Christmas holidays alone, The Sun can reveal. The Prime Minister, 56, and his fiancée, 33, have split up to Prostate Cancer Trust, which helps individuals and families fight the disease. The pair will join a number of other figures who are also expecting their first child on December 30. The Trust will provide free parenthood for the PM and his fiancée, who are due to arrive in Scotland on January 1. But the President of the Royal College of GPs John Healey said: "The pandemic has caused a number of hospital closures across the country and a number of GPs are facing huge supply constraints. "That is a major national threat and we are determined to keep all GPs in line by ensuring they are ready for the best possible value for taxpayers' money." The Public Health England data shows that the infection rate in the 29 days since Christmas has a daily survival of just under 5,cies. The rate in the 30 days since New Year's Eve has a daily survival of almost 3, but the death rate has plummeted by more than a third. Last night Sir Patrick said: "The pandemic has caused a number of hospital closures across the country. "This is a national threat and we are determined to stop it. "We will keep an eye on the numbers, we will help us to do so - we really do." He added: "It is important we continue to make sure we protect the life of the patients we serve. "We will keep people in the UK safe and healthy through December."

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson will today hand 800,000 doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab to Kenya, The Sun can reveal. The UK's key ally in the East Africa has currently only vaccinated about 2 per cent of its population so far. Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta flew into London last night with the pair due to meet at Chequers this afternoon where they will announce the life-saving gift. The AZ jabs are make up the first tranche of 100 million doses the UK vowed to share with poorer countries at June's G7 through the global Covax programme. It's understood other countries set to received doses from Britain will be unveiled in the coming weeks, with Mr Johnson promising the UK will donate 5 million doses by the end of September. The UK helped to establish the international Covax jab effort last year and is its fourth-biggest donor, pledging £548 million to the scheme. Last night a senior government source said: "It's right that as the UK continues our world-beating vaccine rollout at home, we support other countries to get the pandemic under control. "No one is safe from this virus until we're all safe."

<|startofarticle|> LIZ Truss did a Margaret Thatcher yesterday — and climbed aboard the Conservative Party leadership contender as shock jabs and Pauline Latham vibes rattled Westminster. The former Tory leader jabbed the PM with the "unpredictable" accolade while backing her husband to lead the country through Covid. Nick Thomas-Symonds, who was chief of staff to Margaret Thatcher in the 1920s, is said to have told the PM "I told you so." And the PMroseas backed by pals said they were "greatly honoured" to have the young woman as their deputy leader. But today Ms Truss thanked colleagues for the "tough decisions" they have taken and "peppered carefully" on the advice of her doctors. Allies said she was "as healthy and alert as any of her leaders are, and will continue to be." "Just because she's got a nose for politics, doesn't make her a good cop."

<|startofarticle|> LIZ Truss did a Margaret Thatcher yesterday — and climbed aboard the Nazi death machine. The Foreign Secretary addressed world leaders in a surprise Cabinet turnover, reported as saying: "The Queen and Prince of Wales have been deeply moved by the thoughts and concerns of the British people." She added: "They have understood the gravity of the situation and expressed concern about the risks of spreading communism." She later clarified that she meant "the risks" but also the fact that communist states are speeding up their demise. Group officials said she meant to state that the UK is "ways ahead of the curve" in its ability to control its own borders, or that "we don't need foreign aid" to control its own laws.

<|startofarticle|> BRITAIN and Australia are haggling to agree a "staycation" deal that will see Britain snubbing next month amid anti-China espionage concerns. An announcement is expected after the G7 summit in Cornwall. The Australia-Pacific Heads of Government will agree the best that can happen is a breakthrough without action at the United Nations. They are expected to urge the Chinese and Australian governments to take tougher action against the British hypersonic missile threat. The missile is reported to travel five times faster than the speed of sound, meaning it could potentially hit any planet on Earth. It's also feared to be a huge boon to China's military build-up to the next CGTI meeting in Cornwall, which is scheduled for July 11-15. Last night Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said: "We have made clear our concerns about the military capabilities China continues to pursue."

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson and Carrie Symonds will "celebrate their wedding" next summer, The Sun can reveal. The Prime Minister, 56, and his fiancée, 33, have sent save-the-date cards to family and friends for a lavish bash on Saturday, July 30, 2022. The couple got engaged in late 2019 but, like thousands of other loved-up Brits, have had to delay plans because of Covid. Details of exactly where the couple will say "I do" remain a closely guarded secret, but pals say they are waiting until next year for a big celebration to be on the safe side. BoJo is expected to announce that the lockdown cap of 30 guests at weddings will be lifted next month. However, friends of the couple say the fight against the virus, and getting the country bouncing back from the pandemic, means this summer is too soon for their big knees-up. Early contenders as a location for the party include the PM's country pile Chequers in Buckinghamshire, or the Port Lympne safari park in Kent, where Carrie works. Last night a spokesman for the couple declined to comment on a "private family event". The only other PM to marry in office was Lord Liverpool who wed Mary Chester in 1822. Boris and Carrie were first seen together at a 2018 fundraiser. They have already become the first unmarried couple to live in Downing Street, moving there in July 2019. He reportedly proposed on holiday on the Caribbean island of Mustique, shortly after his landslide victory at December 2019's General Election. Commons sleazebusters are currently probing who exactly paid for the five-star trip amid a donations row. The engagement — and news that Carrie was expecting their first child — was announced publicly in late February 2020. The pandemic hit weeks later and the PM faced an intensive-care battle with Covid that April. Son Wilfred was born on April 29, 2020, and given the middle name Nicholas after two doctors who saved the PM's life. Mr Johnson has since remained tight-lipped about his wedding plans. Asked this March if he would be tying the knot when lockdown restrictions lift fully, the PM would only say to The Sun: "The wedding industry is certainly going to come roaring back in common with many other sectors of the economy." News of the pending nuptials will spark plenty of speculation about where the biggest political wedding in decades will be held. Wilfred was christened at Westminster Cathedral in central London in September. Boris also has access to Chequers, used by Prime Ministers as a retreat since the 1920s, and 40 miles from No10. He quit as Foreign Secretary in July 2018, days after a meeting at the estate in which then-PM Theresa May urged her warring Cabinet to hammer out a Brexit plan. Boris also used Chequers' 1,500 acres to convalesce following his virus battle. A source told The Sun tonight: "It would be nice for Chequers to be in the news for happy reasons for once." Looking to read more on the Prime Minister's life? We have you covered... The Port Lympne Reserve and hotel in Kent is also thought to be in the running for next summer's bash. Carrie works for conservation charity the Aspinall Foundation that runs the zoo, home to giraffes, zebras, rhinos and gorillas. The vast reserve also hosts quirky weddings as well as safari tours. Mr Johnson's own country house in his former constituency of Henley, Oxfordshire, could easily have played host to the bash — but it was recently rented out. Commons registers show the farmhouse near Thame is bringing in at least £10,000 a year in rental income. One estate agent's advert offers it for £4,250 a month. The PM also shares a farm and land in Devon with his siblings but it is not thought to be under consideration for the wedding. It had previously been reported that the pair could marry in Italy, where Carrie has relatives. But pals said that would be impractical with travel restrictions for a large party. Another option for the couple could be No10 Downing Street itself. It has plenty of vast state rooms and a large garden that could easily fit hundreds of guests. THE wedding will be the third for Boris — and Carrie's first. He tied the knot with first wife Allegra Mostyn-Owen in 1987. That marriage was annulled in 1993 — the same year he married Marina Wheeler. The couple had four children but separated in 2018. They formally divorced weeks before news emerged of Boris's engagement to Carrie. The only other PM to marry in office was Lord Liverpool who wed Mary Chester in 1822. His first wife Louisa, 54, died the previous year. Boris is also thought to be the first PM to divorce in office since Augustus FitzRoy, the 3rd Duke of Grafton. An act of Parliament allowed him to leave first wife Anne in 1769. He went on to marry Elizabeth W

<|startofarticle|> BRITAIN is getting back on its feet, Boris Johnson declared last night. The Prime Minister hailed the huge numbers of Brits returning to work and school. As millions of children headed for classrooms, an enthusiastic Mr Johnson thanked teachers, pupils and parents in playing their part for this "incredible country". And he vowed to do absolutely everything in his power to help get more workers back to their desks, insisting there would be no extension to the furlough scheme. Although warning there would be "more wretched Covid to come", Mr Johnson said he was "absolutely confident" Britain was on the road to recovery despite worrying images of empty commuter trains amid a sluggish return to towns and cities. Downing Street was unable to supply data on how many were back at work but more than 40 per cent of schools were finally reopened yesterday. And the Cabinet was back in Westminster for their first meeting since the summer break. The PM addressed a gathering of his top team around a socially distanced Cabinet table in the Foreign Office building. He said: "This is the first day back for us but across the country hundreds and thousands, millions of pupils are going back to school thanks to the huge efforts their teachers, their parents have made over the last few days and weeks. "People are going back to the office in huge numbers across our country and quite right, too. "Bit by bit, this incredible country is getting back on its feet and recovering from this crisis. "We, in this Government, are committed to trying to do everything in our power to help. That's what we have been doing over the last few months, and that's what we're going to continue to do." But Mr Johnson warned: "Of course, we know that there is still going to be more of this disease, this wretched Covid, still to come. "We know there will be more outbreaks — and we are absolutely confident that we are going to be able to deal with those outbreaks." After a torrid summer of U-turns, he used the first meeting to try to justify the chaos over free school meals, exam results and masks in schools. He told his ministers: "In the last few months, we've been sailing into the teeth of a gale, no question. "I am no great nautical expert but sometimes it is necessary to tack here and there in response to the facts as they change, in response to the wind's change. "But we have been going steadily in the direction, in the course we set out, and we have not been blown off that course." Yet, he insisted there would be no U-turn over the end of the furlough scheme which begins to wind down this month, despite pressure from MPs to extend it. The Job Retention Scheme set up in March paid furloughed workers 80 per cent of their wages from the public purse. That drops to 70 per cent this month and then 60 per cent in October before its planned conclusion on November 1. Labour and some senior Conservatives are calling for an extension to the scheme. Former Tory Cabinet Minister Stephen Crabb told HuffPost UK: "There are still many firms in different sectors that simply cannot operate in the current scenario. "There is a real danger that the unwinding of furlough will lead to the loss of thousands more high-value jobs "Germany, which knows all about retaining domestic industrial strength, has just decided to continue its furlough scheme for another 12 months." But last night the Treasury firmly slapped down the calls to extend the scheme. And Chancellor Rishi Sunak's firm stance was backed by Mr Johnson who said: "We have been clear that we cannot sustain the situation indefinitely. There isn't any change to the position." His official spokesman added: "By the time the furlough scheme ends, we will have paid wages for eight months saving 9.6 million jobs." The Treasury said: "The end of the furlough scheme is not the end of our support for jobs. For businesses that can successfully bring furloughed employees back to work, this includes a £1,000 job retention bonus." But the Institute for Public Policy Research think tank said ending the arrangement too quickly would be "an historic mistake". It added: "Reforming and extending the scheme now could prevent jobs losses and boost the economy in this time of need." The Treasury will today launch a £2billion Kickstart scheme to help the young unemployed into work. Employers can offer those aged 16 to 24 a six-month work placement even if they are claiming Universal Credit. By Matt Dathan, Deputy Political Editor GAVIN Williamson has insisted next summer's GCSE and A-level exams will go ahead as normal - but didn't rule out a short delay. The under-fire Education Secretary also said he was "deeply sorry" to school pupils who had their grades unfairly downgraded last month.

<|startofarticle|> COUNCIL tax bills will need to rocket by nearly £500 a year to fill an £8 billion blackhole in social care, Town Hall chiefs warn today. The Local Government Association warns that even hiking bills by 25 per cent will not meet the shortfall in care provision over the next three years. But that would see the average Band D home see their annual bill soar by £475 to more than £2,370 by 2024. The Tory-led group of local government bigwigs say just providing the same level of services now mean they need at least £8 billion more in the budgets due to rising costs pressures. Without extra cash they warn "care for older and disabled people, child protection, homelessness prevention, waste and recycling, and road maintenance" will all suffer. With widespread bankruptcies of local service providers predicted by 2024, pressure is mounting on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to use next year's National Insurance raid to to pay for social care sooner. Currently the lion's share of the new Health and Social Care Levy will be used to pay for the massive pandemic backlog in the NHS. The majority of the 12 billion the tax hike will raise is not due to be used for social care until at least 2024. But the LGA say that is too little too late and makes a mockery of the PM's commitment to "level up" the country. They warn without a massive funding hike for town halls at next month's Spending Review, councils will be left with no choice but to punish residents wallets. Cllr James Jamieson, LGA Chairman, said: "Councils continue to face severe funding and demand pressures that will stretch the local services our communities rely on to the limit. "If we are to come out of this pandemic with a society that is truly levelled up, the vital services that councils provide must be at the heart of it. "Councils need certainty over their medium-term finances, adequate funding to tackle day-to-day pressures and long-term investment in people and transforming places across all parts of the country to turn levelling up from a political slogan to a reality that leads to real change for people's lives." Last night Health Secretary Sajid Javid signed off an extra £388 million to fight Covid in care homes this winter. The bumper sum of cash will be used to pay care staff who need to travel to get booster Covid jabs and flu vaccines during their work hours. It will also fund PPE and regular testing of staff through the winter months. Mr Javid said: "Protecting care home staff and residents has been a priority throughout the pandemic and as we move into winter I am committed to ensuring they have the resources they need. "This additional funding demonstrates how we will continue to support those delivering and receiving care. "Everyone deserves to be cared for with dignity and respect and our wider reforms will continue to work towards our aim of a world-leading social care system."

<|startofarticle|> TENSIONS between Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson's boiled over during Budget talks, The Sun can reveal. The Chancellor demanded the PM's aide Danny Vallance leave office for a "ceded breakfast" with his ministers ahead of the vote. Amid criticism of the Prime Minister's performance, Mr Sunak accidentally sent for a late aide as he began to sweat the details out. He stormed out of the crunch meeting after Whitehall minister James Cleverly accused him of "making things up on purpose". Three days before, Mr Johnson had claimed that No10 had not told him that his spending proposals would be delayed until the next General Election. Downing Street and the Home Office had been locked in talks with the Chancellor over a "shared agenda" like Covid jabs and a cut to National Insurance. But reports in Downing Street said Mr Sunak had warned the PM that his proposals would be delayed until the next Budget, despite pleas from the PM for them to be given consideration. The Sun understands Mr Sunak's allies have said he had warned them against doing so. The pair have also frozen the rates at which workers start to pay different levels of income tax, meaning more people will be caught in a higher band over the coming years. The Treasury will on Monday announced a £200 million package to help the post-Covid recovery. And Rob Halfon, of the Henry Jackson Society think-tank, said: "After all this week, the Government is begging the EU for help with masks. "Anybody who wants to wear an uniform to school, or to work, or to work with children should have them." He added: "The Government is demanding funding to help them continue to promote the UK as a global leader." The idea was first suggested by journalist and columnist Emily Thornberry in her book "No10: How the Conservative Party Has Lost the British Dream". Mr Sunak and Mr Johnson have been increasingly at odds since Mr Cummings' departure from No 10 last year. Mr Cummings said the Prime Minister was "increasingly frustrated" with the "unhappiness" of his premiership. The PM said he was "increasingly frustrated" with the demands from senior officers in Mr Johnson's administration, The Sun can reveal. A source said: "The Prime Minister is increasingly frustrated with the increasing demands from senior officers in both camps to get the two departments to agree on a strategy." Other sources suggest the two departments will work together for the short-term but long-term good behaviour. MINISTERS say they are looking at "non-stop action" to get around the rule book designed to keep businesses viable. Salaries have been set at at least £15,000 a year for at least two years after a public interest defence of the minimum wage. THE rate allowed individuals to come up to £9.91 an hour will be raised to £9.91 by the end of this month. And the Skills Bill will make it a criminal offence to work from home after finding "that it is notifiable" for the home working environment. Defence chiefs are considering increasing the legal limit on gatherings to £9.91, saying it risks incurring liability for businesses that do not want to be open. But the Home Office and Commons chiefs have been told 2,000 security personnel will be deployed to schools and offices in September to deal with any surge in gatherings. The Home Office wants to task officials with "establishing a high-level of code" and "interpreting factors such as risk, compliance and morale". Last night a Home Office spokesman said: "The Integrated Review will ensure the Government's high-standards-and-ideas-as-for-a-more-modern-model-of-government-model-are sound."

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson's government appeared to chide Nicola Sturgeon for letting the side down with Scotland's slow vaccination pace last night. And ministers offered to help "accelerate" the pace north of the border with more resources from the UK government - in a move that risked infuriating the nationalists. As the UK hit the ten million jabs mark, the Westminster government wrote to the SNP boss to say "it is in everyone's interests that progress in vaccinating the people of Scotland matches the best efforts of the rest of UK". Scottish Secretary Alister Jack added: "With that in mind, we stand ready to offer any support or assistance we can give you to accelerate your rollout programme." Of the 4.4million adults in Scotland to be vaccinated, so far 610,778 have received the first jab. However Ms Sturgeon accepted that her government did want to "accelerate the overall progress" of the campaign. She reported to MSPs that just under 35,000 first doses were administered on Monday - the highest daily total so far, and 55 per cent more than the number of injections given on the same day last week. But Scottish Conservative Holyrood leader Ruth Davidson noted that on Sunday January 31, "Scotland saw the lowest number of jabs administered since the start of the mass rollout over a month ago". She hit out at the First Minister and said: "At the moment, all the evidence shows the Scottish government's rollout is slow, stuttering and lagging way behind the rest of the UK." While just over a fifth of 75-79-year-olds in Scotland have been vaccinated, Ms Davidson said that was "just a quarter of the proportion vaccinated south of the border" for the same age group. The Scottish government's rollout is slow, stuttering and lagging way behind the rest of the UK. Mr Jack urged Ms Sturgeon to accept assistance, saying: "I strongly believe that to put the nightmare of Covid-19 behind us as quickly as possible, we must collaborate as closely as possible." Ms Sturgeon insisted that going forward the number of injections given will increase "as we make more use of mass vaccination centres for the younger age groups". Two new mass vaccination centres opened in Scotland on Monday, in Edinburgh and Aberdeen. The First Minister said: "I'm not standing here denying we want to accelerate the overall progress." "But nor will I apologise for having deliberately focused on maximising uptake in the most clinically vulnerable groups." Cabinet Minister Jacob Rees Mogg said the offer of help was a clear sign of the "benefits of the United Kingdom".

<|startofarticle|> THE Home Secretary is facing mounting calls to resign if she is forced into a more "social justice" approach than the one she's been on before. Boris Johnson has repeatedly vowed to use every tool in his belt to stop Britain turning into a "nation of informers" — but a growing faction of ministers is calling for a major overhaul. Their members include: former ministers John Major, Penny Mordaunt, David Miscavige, Sir James said he was "mystified" over the crisis in the NHS, adding: "It's about making sure that people feel safe to report them, as we have already done." They added: "Symptoms of post-operative anxiety include low self-esteem, a low self-esteem and a stigmatisation of others."

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson and his top ministers were aware "more than a year ago" that the American woman charged over the death of Harry Dunn was a spy, senior sources have told The Sun. A US court heard last week that fugitive mother-of-three Anne Sacoolas worked in intelligence, but Downing Street have repeatedly insisted Washington only told them she was a diplomat's wife. But The Sun has learnt the UK Government had established Sacoolas's espionage background in the weeks after she fled Britain following her fatal crash with the teenage biker in August 2019. Yet they did not tell Harry's family, despite them asking Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab directly if she was a spy. The Prime Minister has never spoken to Harry's grieving parents, even after repeated requests for a meeting or a call. Sacoolas fled the UK in mid-September 2019 claiming diplomatic immunity, with her lawyer finally admitting last week she was "employed by an intelligence agency in the US" at the time which was "especially a factor" in her departure. Although Dominic Raab insists he was not aware of the case until after Sacoolas was back in the US, this newspaper has established security officials, diplomats and ministers did learn of her spy past in the autumn of 2019. And multiple sources have told The Sun the PM was personally made aware of the situation. No10 have declined to say whether Mr Johnson thinks the United States "misled" Britain about Sacoolas's intelligence career - in what would be a major blow to the Special Relationship But the slain teen's parents have vowed to get to the truth. Last night the family said the case was getting "murkier and murkier" as they once again urged the PM and Mr Raab to "come clean" on exactly what they knew and when. Family spokesman Radd Seiger told The Sun: "Harry's parents have only ever wanted the truth and justice for their son. "To learn, after all this time, that the PM was aware of Mrs Sacoolas' status shortly after the crash and yet did not ensure that the parents were told, is deeply hurtful." He added: "We met with Dominic Raab on 18 December 2019 and 28 January 2020 and several times since and he did not tell us the truth despite us asking the direct question as to whether she was a spy when Harry died. "We need to know who knew what and when, and why we were not told." Asked about the case this week, the PM's press secretary Allegra Stratton said: "I am afraid I can't comment in total detail on that but our position on that has been quite consistent... we couldn't have lawfully prevented her from leaving the UK." "But the Americans refusal to extradite [Sacoolas] is a denial of justice and that is something that the Foreign Secretary has raised with his opposite number in America." Asked why the PM has not met Harry's family, she replied: "I think the family has had considerable engagement with our politicians and I think that it's proper for the people who are familiar with details of the case to deal with the family." Ms Stratton added: "The Prime Minister understands the gravity of how they feel and can only sympathise with the distress of his death in the first place and then how it's how it has been drawn out in the months and years since."

====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson and Rishi Sunak will slash the UK's bloated foreign aid budget to fill the Covid blackhole, No10 all but confirmed today. As The Sun revealed in August, the Chancellor has his eyes on the hallowed cash  — up to £15billion a year — to help plug the budget black hole caused by the virus. Britain is legally bound to spend 0.7 per cent of output on foreign giveaways, but on Tuesday Downing Street said the law allows that pledge to be suspended in extreme times. Mr Johnson's spokesman said: "There may be circumstances in which the government is not able to meet 0.7% commitment – if that happens a Secretary of State has to lay a statement in parliament." The massive hint came after Cabinet Minister Robert Jenrick said the Covid crisis meant that "there is a legitimate question for us to ask at this moment in time whether or not it would be wise to spend somewhat less in light of the fact public finances are in a really challenging situation." The commitment to spend 0.7p per cent of British GDP on foreign giveaways was a flagship policy for former PM David Cameron, who used to try "modernise" the Conservatives. But it's always been loathed by many senior Tories who resented foreign aid swelling even amid cuts to domestic spending and having their hands tied by the arbitrary figure. Although he is understood to have the backing of the PM for the move, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is pushing back on the measure. In September his department took over the Aid department and he has fought back against any attempt to divert funds ever since. When unveiling the merger in June, Boris Johnson warned the UK's aid budget would no longer be a "giant cash point in the sky" for countries like India and China. Mr Johnson has also signalled support for ripping  up rules on aid spending Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. He said instead the focus should be on how to use aid spending to  "maximise British influence" on the world stage. And while planned slashing of the aid budget would infuriate the charities and opposition parties it would delight scores of Conservative MPs who have hated it for a decade. Jeremy Hutton, a policy analyst for the Taxpayer Alliance, said: "It's about time ministers made use of this aid loophole. "As we've long said, the law does allow the aid budget to be slashed in a crisis. "The Covid pandemic gives Whitehall more than enough wiggle room to do the right thing and ensure taxpayers' money stays at home. "Well done to Rishi for exploring all the avenues available to cut back wasteful spending and balance the books." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson's government appears to have made a decision that ends years of harassment. The Prime Minister, when asked if he could talk to his wives without their approval, admitted they would "dream" of having a Downing Street relationship. He told The Sun: "They are my friends." The government classed harassment as a "true friend" and reported it as a "gender-based offence". But the Office for National Statistics reported in 2013 that the wives of senior Cabinet ministers made up a third of their Cabinet office staff, and more than half of all committee staff, were sexist comments. The OBR also found that the wives of senior ministers also made up 43 per cent of the wives of CCHQ staff who were sexist remarks. Mr Johnson also said he had "never" signed up to a survey asking people to list friends and colleagues they had had a "bona fide relationship" with. Mr Johnson's comments about government gender balanced out much of what he said, and showed sexist remarks made by his colleagues. Cabinet Secretary Simon Case said: "I have never met with anyone else who has felt excluded or bullied by this or any other sexism survey. "I have never met with any female CCHQ officer and I have not been told of any incidents of this sort. "I have only heard of one incident and that was reported to the Police. "I have called HR about this and received a fairly good explanation of how the survey is intended to be used in police and security services." THE Home Secretary said she was "extremely concerned" with the way claims were being made that her department was sexist-baited. She told Times Radio: "I am not, you know, a racist. I'm a dad of eight kids. There's nothing racist about what I read and believe in. "I just don't support such obscene things being said about children. "I don't think it's right that the Home Secretary remarks in this paper. "I would hope that the Home Secretary would be more careful. "I know that he is responsible for his own words and actions. I don't think he is proud of them. "I don't think he is happy with the way the responses have been distributed around the country. "There is a history of insensitivity to victims of racism in the Home Secretary's Government. "I have no doubt that she will be looking into this matter very, very carefully and with due regard to every step taken by the Home Secretary in these last few months. "But I don't believe that I have been able to shake off that which came before." In her book "The Secret Life of a Cabinet Secretary" published next week, Ms. Hartley outlines her many sexist achievements, including the appointment of a female CCHQ superintending officer as well as the appointment of the first face of the new Foreign Secretary in charge of the TV7 reshuffle. But she said there was only a "six out of ten" chance she would be reopening the door again. Ms. Hartley said: "When I first walked in the door, I didn't think there was a single creep in the room. I didn't think anyone was looking for me. I was just happy to be anywhere near where I am now. "I am a person of integrity, and I will continue to be so. But the more I saw of the other girls in the room, the more creepier it became to say the least. "There was a very aggressive culture of objectification and rejection of other women. The whole building was looking up for me. "There was a very toxic environment of hating women in general, and Asian-Americans in particular. "It was very un-British." But speaking publicly for the first time about the harassment she faced, she said: "It's very personal." She said: "It's very hard to look away from the fact that there has been a history of abuse and discrimination and this is indeed something that we as a society have got to work on. "But it's right that the Home Secretary, as the Prime Minister would hope, should be looking after people like that, doesn't she?" THE first thing Mr Johnson will do when he returns from Europe — with a package of eco-friendly holiday gifts for the PM — will be to give a full throated defence of his flagship Eat Out to Help Out scheme. Created in 2014, the Eat Out scheme has helped millions to reduce food waste and tax rises by 20 to 0.5 per cent over the next three years. The scheme is also giving away 10 vouchers, worth around £1,000, each to employees who eat outside. Mr Johnson will also be giving away five White Stallion Wings, worth £2,500, to employees of his private company, Lloyd's Sporting Goods. The exports will carry with them rewards such as race cars, designer wear and jewellery. The UK exported 10,000 of the animals to New Zealand last year to help run its zoo, which is leading

<|startofarticle|> THERESA May could make a shock return to frontline politics with a major new Government job, it was claimed tonight. The ex-PM was a key member of Mrs Johnson's team who was instrumental in securing the 2019 vaccine rollout. The Queen and today's Cabinet Minister are also thought to be working together closely on Covid cases. The Queen and other senior figures are understood to be concentrating on whether to offer a second dose of the Mr Biden visa after secure travel for the UK and Ireland. The row dominated PMQs on Wednesday, with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accusing the PM of doing favours for those who have his personal mobile number. Sir James, now based in Singapore, had told the PM that he must "get a grip" after broken leg and Achilles surgery on Tuesday to keep him in check. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock rejected the report as "a grip" and instead a "propaganda tool". Sir James told the BBC: "I hope when we get into the details of the report we can get some of the details of the algorithm and the ways in which Facebook and other social media companies can serve as a learning experience for children and parents." He added: "I hope the prime minister, as the first minister of the UK, can say that in his report he can say 'it worked, it seems to me, it should be recognised'. "I expect he will also say a lot more in the coming weeks to fill in some of the gaps in the Government's approach to data and the internet." Yesterday Mr Johnson took centre stage at the UN General Assembly to give a doomladen speech about the pandemic. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson and Joe Biden will put reopening UK-US travel top of the agenda when they finally meet today. The US President landed in Britain last night ahead of this weekend's G7 summit in Cornwall — on his first foreign visit in office. Air Force One touched down at RAF Mildenhall, Suffolk, just before 8pm where Mr Biden, 78, and his wife Gill, 70, addressed US troops as they began their eight-day trip to Europe. Mr Biden said his visit would show that "the United States is back" and democracies are standing together. He added that as founding members of Nato, the US and UK were part of the "strongest military and political alliance in history" — but warned it needed to be "modernised" to protect against new challenges. He is set to meet Mr Johnson today when they will discuss resuming flights. They were stopped more than 400 days ago because of the pandemic. The leaders will also forge a post-Brexit accord focusing on global health, climate change and Covid recovery. It will mirror the Atlantic Charter signed in 1941 by the then British PM and US President, Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Mr Johnson said: "While Churchill and Roosevelt faced the question of how to help the world recover following a devastating war, today we have to reckon with a very different but no less intimidating challenge — how to build back better from the coronavirus pandemic. "Co-operation between the UK and US, the closest of partners and the greatest of allies, will be crucial for the future of the world's stability and prosperity." PRESIDENT Biden would be a disaster for Britain, gleeful Remainers claimed. His Irish ancestry left him ill-disposed to us. He hated Brexit and loved the EU, which he would always prioritise. The US would never do a trade deal with us. Worse still, the Democrats disliked Boris, who was just Donald Trump with a British accent. And so on and so on. Now, after months of warmth, the two leaders will today forge a historic new transatlantic pact. Do the Boris-haters call anything right? Mr Biden, who will meet the Queen at Windsor after the summit, has said one aim of his trip was to show China and Russia that the Western alliance is strong. He will leave the UK for Brussels for talks with EU and Nato chiefs, before meeting Russia's Vladimir Putin. Heads of state from France, Germany, Canada, Italy and Japan will also be at the G7 summit at Carbis Bay. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson and Carrie Symonds will "celebrate their wedding" next summer, The Sun can reveal. The Prime Minister, 56, and his fiancée, 33, have sent save-the-date cards to family and friends for a lavish bash on Saturday, July 30, 2022. The couple got engaged in late 2019 but, like thousands of other loved-up Brits, have had to delay plans because of Covid. Details of exactly where the couple will say "I do" remain a closely guarded secret, but pals say they are waiting until next year for a big celebration to be on the safe side. BoJo is expected to announce that the lockdown cap of 30 guests at weddings will be lifted next month. However, friends of the couple say the fight against the virus, and getting the country bouncing back from the pandemic, means this summer is too soon for their big knees-up. Early contenders as a location for the party include the PM's country pile Chequers in Buckinghamshire, or the Port Lympne safari park in Kent, where Carrie works. Last night a spokesman for the couple declined to comment on a "private family event". The only other PM to marry in office was Lord Liverpool who wed Mary Chester in 1822. Boris and Carrie were first seen together at a 2018 fundraiser. They have already become the first unmarried couple to live in Downing Street, moving there in July 2019. He reportedly proposed on holiday on the Caribbean island of Mustique, shortly after his landslide victory at December 2019's General Election. Commons sleazebusters are currently probing who exactly paid for the five-star trip amid a donations row. The engagement — and news that Carrie was expecting their first child — was announced publicly in late February 2020. The pandemic hit weeks later and the PM faced an intensive-care battle with Covid that April. Son Wilfred was born on April 29, 2020, and given the middle name Nicholas after two doctors who saved the PM's life. Mr Johnson has since remained tight-lipped about his wedding plans. Asked this March if he would be tying the knot when lockdown restrictions lift fully, the PM would only say to The Sun: "The wedding industry is certainly going to come roaring back in common with many other sectors of the economy." News of the pending nuptials will spark plenty of speculation about where the biggest political wedding in decades will be held. Wilfred was christened at Westminster Cathedral in central London in September. Boris also has access to Chequers, used by Prime Ministers as a retreat since the 1920s, and 40 miles from No10. He quit as Foreign Secretary in July 2018, days after a meeting with therapist Dr Alan Mendoza, at which top ministers offered him a job in the Cabinet. The PM also used Chequers' 1,500 acres to convalesce following his virus battle. A source told The Sun tonight: "It would be nice for Chequers to be in the news for happy reasons for once." Looking to read more on the Prime Minister's life? We have you covered... The Port Lympne Reserve and hotel in Kent is also thought to be in the running for next summer's bash. Carrie works for conservation charity the Aspinall Foundation that runs the zoo, home to giraffes, zebras, rhinos and gorillas. The vast reserve also hosts quirky weddings as well as safari tours. Mr Johnson's own country house in his former constituency of Henley, Oxfordshire, could easily have played host to the bash — but it was recently rented out. Commons registers show the farmhouse near Thame is bringing in at least £10,000 a year in rental income. One estate agent's advert offers it for £4,250 a month. The PM also shares a farm and land in Devon with his siblings but it is not thought to be under consideration for the wedding. It had previously been reported that the pair could marry in Italy, where Carrie has relatives. But pals said that would be impractical with travel restrictions for a large party. Another option for the couple could be No10 Downing Street itself. It has plenty of vast state rooms and a large garden that could easily fit hundreds of guests. THE wedding will be the third for Boris — and Carrie's first. He tied the knot with first wife Allegra Mostyn-Owen in 1987. That marriage was annulled in 1993 — the same year he married Marina Wheeler. The couple had four children but separated in 2018. They formally divorced weeks before news emerged of Boris's engagement to Carrie. The only other PM to marry in office was Lord Liverpool who wed Mary Chester in 1822. His first wife Louisa, 54, died the previous year. Boris is also thought to be the first PM to divorce in office since Augustus FitzRoy, the 3rd Duke of Grafton. An act of Parliament allowed him to leave first wife Anne in 1769. He went on to marry Elizabeth Wro

<|startofarticle|> HIKING fuel duty would be a hammer blow to "not just motorists but their families" a Treasury minister once declared. As Chancellor Rishi Sunak eyes the first rise in a decade of the hated levy at next month's Budget, The Sun can reveal Treasury chiefs have their suspicions. According to The Sun, ministers have been told Rishi "is determined to get the furlough scheme open again after the Easter holidays". The hated levy is being used to fund social care and is being used to fund VAT on fuel." The Sun can reveal an "encouraged" Treasury official said: "The fuel duty is high and the pump prices are going up. "So the Furlough scheme is a good place to start." The Treasury declined to comment on the hefty bill. Furlough is one of the most widely used forms of pay, but the economic impact on families during the pandemic has been immense. A survey by Opinium found that the average cost of a litre of petrol has lost more than £1,000 a year in value over the past three months. The Sun understands one in six pounds spent on petrol has now been spent in the Treasury.

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson is facing mounting calls to resign after a week in power. The PM was accused by many in the Cabinet of being "too focused" on the 12pm curfew. He was pushed into a corner over the curfew itself, with some Cabinet ministers stepping down in the wake of last week's deadly power out. At his first virtual meeting with Mr Johnson, Dominic Raab told the Commons he was "trying to get the government to do a much better job of it" after reports that Mr Johnson was cutting back on TV briefings. The PM said he was "working on it" but added: "I'm also working on it with my legal team and they're working really, really hard on it." He will alsorect a fund to help those in need to help pay for refurbishment of homes and firms, and is set to announce plans for new guidelines in the coming days. But Mr Raab will insist the cut in the rate of the rule is "just the tip of the iceberg" when it comes to the crisis. He will insist the pandemic has shown that Britain is ready for a new round of partnership with the EU. He will also vow to use every tool in his power to protect the UK and its relationship with Brussels - meaning "no'lins on lockdown, no'lins to the EU. The PM said he was "absolutely committed" to a deal but he did not want to put in extra hours to try to get the deal through the Commons without opposition. The rebels have been fighting to get the 12pm curfew into law after a series of shocking incidents — including the stabbing death of 19-year-old student body leader Nadine Dorries in the halls of Parliament. Last week Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced hospital hopes will be suspended in the wake of the MP's death "shortly". HMG also announced the transport of their own young leader, saying she will be staying in her parents' care. Her mother, Barbara, said the decision not to extend the ban on MP's and journalists attending schools was "an outrageous and serious infringement on people's liberties and freedoms." She added: "It's shameful that Boris Johnson is determined to keep the Government honest on its promises to the North".

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson will today hand 800,000 doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab to Kenya, The Sun can reveal. The UK's key ally in the East Africa has currently only vaccinated about 2 per cent of its population so far. Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta flew into London last night with the pair due to meet at Chequers this afternoon where they will announce the life-saving gift. The AZ jabs are make up the first tranche of 100 million doses the UK vowed to share with poorer countries at June's G7 through the global Covax programme. It's understood other countries set to received doses from Britain will be unveiled in the coming weeks, with Mr Johnson promising the UK will donate 5 million doses by the end of September. The UK helped to establish the international Covax jab effort last year and is its fourth-biggest donor, pledging £548 million to the scheme. Last night a senior government source said: "It's right that as the UK continues our world-beating vaccine rollout at home, we support other countries to get the pandemic under control. "No one is safe from this virus until we're all safe."

<|startofarticle|> ISLAMIC State remains a "potent" threat to Britain and is managing to regroup — partly due to Covid, a report says. Iraqi forces trained by the West have been hammered by the virus as they try to rid the region of the jihadi terrorists. The Ministry of Defence espionage unit warns that Russia and Iran have all but given up the counter-ISIS fight in Eastern Syria giving the berserkers a chance to regroup. The so-called Islamic State stretched across 41,000 square miles of Iraq and Syria at its 2015 peak. But despite being routed by Western backed forces through 2016 and 2017, the last remnants of the group still pose a clear threat to the UK as a recruitment banner for "would be attackers". "Since November 2019, there have been four terrorist attacks in the UK, all of which are assessed to have been motivated and inspired by Islamist terrorism," it adds. Last month the terror threat level for the UK was raised to "severe" meaning another attack is "highly likely." The report dated October of this year and seen by The Sun warns ISIS have not "abandoned their long-term objective of re-establishing a Caliphate" but have "transitioned into a clandestine insurgency". Nonetheless the intelligence chiefs say they "have displayed a resilience which remains a potent threat to the future stability of Iraq and Syria." And while they are only able to carry out "less sophisticated attacks" they nonetheless still have "freedom of movement permitting them to plan, prepare and facilitate attacks" and crucially "raise revenue" for nefarious activity as far away Western Africa, Egypt and South East Asia. And it "still maintains a global network of affiliates and branches, to which it provides high-level strategic guidance and media and financial support." But efforts to clamp down this year have been hit by the Covid pandemic according to a summary version of the Regional Threat Outlook prepared at the request of ministers. The report reads: "The Iraqi Security Forces have proven themselves effective, but, in common with many other armed forces, are circumscribed by Covid-19."

<|startofarticle|> LIZ Truss did a Margaret Thatcher yesterday — and climbed aboard the British tank to warn Russia against invasion plans. The Foreign Secretary said President Vladimir Putin would be making a strategic mistake if he took military action to extend his territory. Wearing a helmet and armoured vest, Ms Truss was just miles from the Russian border as she declared: "We will stand with our fellow democracies against Russia's malign activity." And she vowed Nato would safeguard the security of Ukraine amid growing fears Putin will annexe the neighbour state. Mrs Thatcher revived her Iron Lady status in 1986 by riding on a Challenger tank at a Nato training camp in Germany — wearing goggles and a headscarf. The ambitious Ms Truss was visiting hundreds of battle-ready British troops near Tallinn, Estonia, right. Back home, she has parked her tanks firmly on No10's lawn by topping a Tory party members poll. It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson's unpopularity plunged to new lows — coming bottom for recent performance in the eyes of the true blue faithful. The PM is now ranked minus 17, according to the latest grassroots survey for ConservativeHome, while Ms Truss has a plus 82.3 rating. Her tank stunt came ahead of Nato foreign ministers gathering in Latvia to consider how to respond to Russia's military build-up near the Ukrainian border — and tensions between Belarus and Poland. She used the Riga summit to call for the western alliance to stand united in the face of growing aggression from Moscow. Ms Truss said: "We want a world where freedom and democracy don't just survive, they thrive." And she rejected Kremlin claims that Nato's actions were provocative.

<|startofarticle|> CULTURE wars and woke attacks on Britain are a gift to our enemies, Liz Truss will declare. Endless bickering over how bad the UK is makes us a laughing stock to adversaries and gives hostile statesmen the excuse to invade, torture and murder. She will tell the most senior diplomats that the UK has been too naval gazing since the Berlin Wall fell and it is time to "step forward, be proud of who we are and what we stand for, ready to shape the world anew". It comes as tensions with Russia mount over Ukraine. Ms Truss will tell the Chatham House think tank today: "In recent years the free world took its eyes off the ball. "After the collapse of communism, many were convinced it was the end of history, confident that freedom and democracy would go global. "People turned inwards. It's time to wake up. The age of introspection must end now. "We need to believe in Britain and project the best of Britain to the world. "I want us to be confident, outward-looking, patriotic and positive and to be proud of our great country." She plans to closer partnerships with allies like Japan, Australia, Canada, Indonesia and India across trade, tech and security. An ally said: "Liz thinks we need to spend less time quarrelling among ourselves and more on promoting freedom and winning the battle for global influence against bad guys."

<|startofarticle|> BRITAIN is being "brought down by the loneliness of No10" and there is "growing evidence of a culture of turning a blind eye to the problems". Insiders suggest the PM's allies in No10 are being hammered by "fear and loathing" following the rift with Ms Sturgeon. One said: "The Prime Minister is failing to understand the problem he has stumbled into – a leadership war — with Ms Sturgeon."

<|startofarticle|> LIZ Truss is "nowhere near" having a vaccine with another BoltCure member. Yesterday health chiefs confirmed a third dose of the vaccine had worked - and that the pair were planning a night of entertainment. Batoot Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty confirmed the social media giant was "closing in on Truss as the door to heaven is closing". Prof Whitty said: "We are grateful to all those that campaigned against them and their BoltBuster devices. "We will now work with our partners to ensure they can safely and effectively use the public space. "Public consent is not required however." Prof Whitty added: "We are happy to say that this approach allows us to reduce the number of cases and deaths from Covid-19-secure devices." Bolt was created by billionaire PM David Cameron in 2013 to help keep the country safe. It is widely used by security personnel and police to help keep people safe from attackers, but it is often turned on by bosses and force members rather than the public. The body was set up in a government consultation on Thursday.

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson has his randy teller-in-chief back in Downing Street in full force, with the PM expected to hammer out a trade deal with the EU in days. The PM met Michel Barnier yesterday evening to hammer out a trade deal - but avoided outright agreement with the EU over fishing. EU chiefs are furious they were left out of Britain's deal with Brussels after the PM declined to shake their hand before it was finally signed off. Brussels boss Ursula von der Leyen said she was "very concerned" after she saw the video remarks made by Mr Johnson. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson has offered up Britain's stadiums for the whole European Championships as the UK's vaccine roll-out surges ahead of the continent — and he can't wait to raise a pint to the prospect. The football tournament's semi-finals and final are already pencilled in for Wembley in July but temporary teetotaller Mr Johnson said last night: "Any other matches they want hosted, we are certainly on for that!" It could kick-start a "bonanza" decade of footy, with Chancellor Rishi Sunak set to pump millions into funding the UK and Ireland's joint pitch to host the 2030 World Cup in tomorrow's Budget. In an exclusive interview with The Sun, the Prime Minister said: "We are very, very keen to bring football home in 2030. I do think it's the right place. "It's the home of football, it's the right time. It will be an absolutely wonderful thing for the country." Mr Johnson hopes the image of plucky Brexit Britain, fresh from its vaccine success, hosting the European tournament this summer would be a great advert for the UK's 2030 bid. And he hopes it will encourage us all to play more sport so the country can "build back fitter" from Covid. The PM admitted he is gasping for a pint at his local to toast the possibility of greater Euros involvement just as soon as the pubs are allowed to start serving again. Admitting he is currently "on the wagon", Mr Johnson said not being able to have a tipple during lockdown had been "a nightmare". He said that he would "line up" the pints at the first opportunity when pubs and restaurants are permitted to begin serving outside next month under his strict lockdown-easing policies. As well as pubs reopening in April, trials will begin into how best to get fans safely back into football grounds. We are very, very keen to bring football home in 2030. By Harry Cole BORIS Johnson showed off his painting skills to a class of key workers' kids yesterday ahead of schools returning next week. The Sun joined the PM at St Mary's Primary in Stoke-on-Trent, where he defended the pace of lockdown easing. He said: "Education is the priority. Getting all schools open on March 8 is something we have set our hearts on for a long time." With all Covid restrictions scheduled to be lifted by mid June, it is hoped that — with vaccine passports and mass-testing — Wembley could be at 90,000-capacity by the July finals. Ministers are in talks with UEFA amid fears the current plan to host the contest across 11 European cities will be sunk by soaring Covid cases across the Channel. Mr Johnson said: "We are hosting the Euros. We are hosting the semis and the final. "If there's, you know, if they want any other matches that they want hosted, we're certainly on for that but at the moment that's where we are with UEFA." And a summer of football this year would showcase Britain as the perfect venue for the World Cup in nine years' time. The Sun can reveal that Chancellor Sunak's Budget tomorrow will earmark £2.8million to promote the UK and Ireland's official pitch to FIFA to hold the tournament. There will also be £25million in new funding from the Treasury to help the grassroots game grow. It would be enough to fund around 700 new pitches across the UK. That will helps towards the government's plans to get Britain match fit for the future Mr Johnson insisted: "One of the things we want to do is we want to bounce back fitter. "We want to bounce back better, but also we want to do much more to encourage sport in this country post pandemic." And Mr Sunak will earmark a further £1.2million of new funding so that the Women's European Championships goes ahead in England in July 2022. Mr Johnson said: "We want to see a bonanza of football in the years ahead." But he insisted that this summer's revelry would not be possible without the "absolutely stunning" ongoing success of the country's vaccine roll-out. Mr Johnson said he could "only echo Her Majesty the Queen" in her recent message for everyone to get jabbed. Ahead of the Budget, Mr Johnson said: "The vaccination programme has given us a great deal more certainty than we might otherwise have had." During a visit to St Mary's CE Primary School in Tunstall, Stoke-on-Trent, he added: "I have no doubt that if we get it right, as I'm sure we can, we can have a strong, jobs-led recovery. "I think that it could be much stronger than many of the pessimists have been saying over the last six months or so." And he said the roll-out success had added certainty to his proposals from last month to ease the country out of lockdown. He said: "It has given us a lot of assurances and credibility to

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson told Emmanuel Macron to "get a grip" last night as he compared France's meltdown over the new UK, US and Aussie defence to the behaviour of a jilted lover. Macron shook Macron's hand and told him to "get a grip." Macron said the UK, US and Australian exercises would be "an epic mistake" and vowed to punish the "upset" tycoon. He said: "They are determined that we will go after their technology, their satellites and their communications. "It's an epic mistake to have such a high priority on this." His comments came after Defence Secretary Ben Wallace warned abandoning nuclear submarines would be "unimaginable" given current aeronautical challenges. Adm Ted Christie, vice-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said that Australia and New Zealand will forge a new defence pact in the next few days. Mr Wallace warned: "This is the last chance saloon for the Australian submarine pact. "It's impossible to defend a country when it's accused of warring with America over the bomb. "And because it's drawn up on Australia, we are bound to conclude that it's wrong to strike a bargain whereby, first of all, we give up the bomb and, secondly, we give up the world for the United Nations. "And so it goes the argument. "If we can do it successfully, so can you. "If you can do it successfully, so can I. Joe Biden. "It's a question of survival." Remainers fear a No Deal will see Britain become a Robin Hood state. But he did not rule out our being drawn into a wider No Deal, saying: "As an independent nation, the UK could be a little overwhelmed by things, but we will be overwhelmed by them." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson's government appeared to chide Nicola Sturgeon for letting the side down with Scotland's slow vaccination pace last night. And ministers offered to help "accelerate" the pace north of the border with more resources from the UK government - in a move that risked infuriating the nationalists. As the UK hit the ten million jabs mark, the Westminster government wrote to the SNP boss to say "it is in everyone's interests that progress in vaccinating the people of Scotland matches the best efforts of the rest of UK". Scottish Secretary Alister Jack added: "With that in mind, we stand ready to offer any support or assistance we can give you to accelerate your rollout programme." Of the 4.4million adults in Scotland to be vaccinated, so far 610,778 have received the first jab. However Ms Sturgeon accepted that her government did want to "accelerate the overall progress" of the campaign. She reported to MSPs that just under 35,000 first doses were administered on Monday - the highest daily total so far, and 55 per cent more than the number of injections given on the same day last week. But Scottish Conservative Holyrood leader Ruth Davidson noted that on Sunday January 31, "Scotland saw the lowest number of jabs administered since the start of the mass rollout over a month ago". She hit out at the First Minister and said: "At the moment, all the evidence shows the Scottish government's rollout is slow, stuttering and lagging way behind the rest of the UK." While just over a fifth of 75-79-year-olds in Scotland have been vaccinated, Ms Davidson said that was "just a quarter of the proportion vaccinated south of the border" for the same age group. The Scottish government's rollout is slow, stuttering and lagging way behind the rest of the UK. Mr Jack urged Ms Sturgeon to accept assistance, saying: "I strongly believe that to put the nightmare of Covid-19 behind us as quickly as possible, we must collaborate as closely as possible." Ms Sturgeon insisted that going forward the number of injections given will increase "as we make more use of mass vaccination centres for the younger age groups". Two new mass vaccination centres opened in Scotland on Monday, in Edinburgh and Aberdeen. The First Minister said: "I'm not standing here denying we want to accelerate the overall progress." "But nor will I apologise for having deliberately focused on maximising uptake in the most clinically vulnerable groups." Cabinet Minister Jacob Rees Mogg said the offer of help was a clear sign of the "benefits of the United Kingdom".

<|startofarticle|> BRITS face yet another uncertain Christmas amid Covid and supply chain chaos, Rishi Sunak has announced. The Chancellor said yesterday: "The Government is playing by the rules but there is a catch - we are still in the throes of a pandemic and there are rules I don't quite understand." In a major boost for the red-hot tech sector, the I'm a Celebrity contestant and TV personality level and the man for the job. He told the BBC: "The thing is we are still in the throes of a pandemic, and there are rules I don't quite understand." Sunak, 40, will have made clear he will not run the country's supply chains - but faces a tough few months. The UK's two million reaped by the single biggest consumer product in the world, the Covid ration has to be bought up and distributed amongst others. "If we cannot get those rules in place, how can we get vaccines on the market?" he asked. "I'm not standing here denying we will do it, but there must be a political will to do it. "We are Covid backers, and that's what counts. But what I care about is how people buy into it. "I care about the fact that we are lifting millions of people off that pandemic poverty line and putting boosters in the hands of the forecourt of vaccine industry lawyers." Mr Sunak is set to face a grilling from senior female vaccine officials after their affair was exposed as a key part of a wider pattern of behaviour. A vaccine spokeswoman said: "For any support or compensation for this activity, contact [Hospitals]." The Independent Vaccination Programme General Director Victoria Profame revealed the affair last night. She said: "The Independent Vaccination Programme is a unit of the UK Government that meets twice a year at four locations across the country. "We gather relevant data and analyse it for useful decisions. "If you can identify a cause for concern it is raised with the appropriate authorities."

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson is facing the wrath of Scottish fishermen as Brexit border pressure starts to bite. Scots fishermen say new bureaucracy makes exporting to Europe all but impossible for fresh seafood, leaving shellfish rotting at Dover. Yesterday Downing Street promised £100 million in compensation to those businesses blighted by the changing rules "by no fault of their own". The row was worsened after fishing minister Victoria Prentis admitted she has not read Mr Johnson's EU deal causing the changes. The bungling Tory claimed to have been "very busy on Christmas Eve" when the agreement came through, "organising the local nativity trail". Yesterday Environment Secretary George Eustice insisted to MPs the issue can be quickly resolved. He told the Commons: "They are only teething problems, once people get used to using the paperwork goods will flow normally." But Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross said financial compensation is "clearly needed by our fishermen right across the country". During an urgent question on the matter in the Commons on Thursday, MPs from all parties voiced their concerns about exports of Scottish seafood from smaller companies being halted for a further five days by transport company DFDS. DFDS stopped exports last week after delays in getting new paperwork introduced following the expiry of the Brexit transition period for EU border posts in France. Paperwork has to be approved before consignments can be sent to DFDS's warehouse in South Lanarkshire and then on to English Channel ports. Liberal Democrat MP Alistair Carmichael described the situation as "a shambles of the Government's own making".

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson and Carrie Symonds will "celebrate their wedding" next summer, The Sun can reveal. The Prime Minister, 56, and his fiancée, 33, have sent save-the-date cards to family and friends for a lavish bash on Saturday, July 30, 2022. The couple got engaged in late 2019 but, like thousands of other loved-up Brits, have had to delay plans because of Covid. Details of exactly where the couple will say "I do" remain a closely guarded secret, but pals say they are waiting until next year for a big celebration to be on the safe side. BoJo is expected to announce that the lockdown cap of 30 guests at weddings will be lifted next month. However, friends of the couple say the fight against the virus, and getting the country bouncing back from the pandemic, means this summer is too soon for their big knees-up. Early contenders as a location for the party include the PM's country pile Chequers in Buckinghamshire, or the Port Lympne safari park in Kent, where Carrie works. Last night a spokesman for the couple declined to comment on a "private family event". The only other PM to marry in office was Lord Liverpool who wed Mary Chester in 1822. Boris and Carrie were first seen together at a 2018 fundraiser. They have already become the first unmarried couple to live in Downing Street, moving there in July 2019. He reportedly proposed on holiday on the Caribbean island of Mustique, shortly after his landslide victory at December 2019's General Election. Commons sleazebusters are currently probing who exactly paid for the five-star trip amid a donations row. The engagement — and news that Carrie was expecting their first child — was announced publicly in late February 2020. The pandemic hit weeks later and the PM faced an intensive-care battle with Covid that April. Son Wilfred was born on April 29, 2020, and given the middle name Nicholas after two doctors who saved the PM's life. Mr Johnson has since remained tight-lipped about his wedding plans. Asked this March if he would be tying the knot when lockdown restrictions lift fully, the PM would only say to The Sun: "The wedding industry is certainly going to come roaring back in common with many other sectors of the economy." News of the pending nuptials will spark plenty of speculation about where the biggest political wedding in decades will be held. Wilfred was christened at Westminster Cathedral in central London in September. Boris also has access to Chequers, used by Prime Ministers as a retreat since the 1920s, and 40 miles from No10. He quit as Foreign Secretary in July 2018, days after a meeting at the estate in which then-PM Theresa May urged her warring Cabinet to hammer out a Brexit plan. Boris also used Chequers' 1,500 acres to convalesce following his virus battle. A source told The Sun tonight: "It would be nice for Chequers to be in the news for happy reasons for once." Looking to read more on the Prime Minister's life? We have you covered... The Port Lympne Reserve and hotel in Kent is also thought to be in the running for next summer's bash. Carrie works for conservation charity the Aspinall Foundation that runs the zoo, home to giraffes, zebras, rhinos and gorillas. The vast reserve also hosts quirky weddings as well as safari tours. Mr Johnson's own country house in his former constituency of Henley, Oxfordshire, could easily have played host to the bash — but it was recently rented out. Commons registers show the farmhouse near Thame is bringing in at least £10,000 a year in rental income. One estate agent's advert offers it for £4,250 a month. The PM also shares a farm and land in Devon with his siblings but it is not thought to be under consideration for the wedding. It had previously been reported that the pair could marry in Italy, where Carrie has relatives. But pals said that would be impractical with travel restrictions for a large party. Another option for the couple could be No10 Downing Street itself. It has plenty of vast state rooms and a large garden that could easily fit hundreds of guests. THE wedding will be the third for Boris — and Carrie's first. He tied the knot with first wife Allegra Mostyn-Owen in 1987. That marriage was annulled in 1993 — the same year he married Marina Wheeler. The couple had four children but separated in 2018. They formally divorced weeks before news emerged of Boris's engagement to Carrie. The only other PM to marry in office was Lord Liverpool who wed Mary Chester in 1822. His first wife Louisa, 54, died the previous year. Boris is also thought to be the first PM to divorce in office since Augustus FitzRoy, the 3rd Duke of Grafton. An act of Parliament allowed him to leave first wife Anne in 1769. He went on to marry Elizabeth W

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson will offer Australia a 15-year transition to an historic zero-tariff, zero-quota trade deal, The Sun can reveal. Trade Secretary Liz Truss has the Cabinet's blessing to ink such a post-Brexit accord with our longstanding ally despite fierce resistance from Britain's farmers. Agriculture has been running sore in the trade negotiations - with the Aussie's pushing for a rapid five year slashing of all import and export taxes on goods. But amid fears our farmers could be undercut by an influx of cheaper Aussie beef and lamb, the decade and half bulwark was agreed by the inner-Cabinet committee in charge of talks. The offer will now be made to the Australian side - with ministerial sources confident an agreement is now in sight despite further haggling to be done on the exact length of the transition. Advocates for the deal say food and wine will get cheaper in British supermarkets when import levies are abolished. But the tariffs on imports and exports on all goods would be "tapered out slowly" to allow Brit farmers to adjust after a major row over the deal had erupted. Dubbed the "battle for the soul of Brexit" the PM threw his weight behind Cabinet free traders led by Ms Truss in a blow to protectionists Michael Gove and George Eustice who wanted to limit the terms of the deal. Environment Secretary Mr Eustice had been pushing for quotas on meat imports from down under to be included in the deal, but a government source said he was "left isolated" with his plea. Brexiteers had argued keeping tariffs and quotas would undermine the point of breaking away from Brussels to strike out with new deals, and Australia should be able to trade on the same terms we trade with the EU. Mr Johnson's trade strategy committee - that included the Foreign and Business Secretaries as well as the Chancellor - are understood to have agreed to include other protections to maintain high standards of farming, but concluded to the "grand principle" that the tariff barriers should be dropped. Australia and the UK could now sign the new treaty when their PM Scott Morrison jets to Cornwall next month for the G7 summit. Declining to comment on the details of the meeting, last night No10 said the PM "wants to maximise the massive opportunities presented by post-Brexit trade deals." The PM's spokesman insisted that any agreement would include protections for our agriculture industry and won't undercut UK farmers, adding: "We want a deal that is good for the British public and any agreement would have protection for the agriculture industry."

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson is facing a growing rebellion from his own backbenchers to abandon his long-standing position - and join the Government. The Prime Minister is under pressure to go further than the Commons can go and confirm second wave of the Covid pandemic before it starts to put an end to the legend of the Beeb. And there is growing concern in his own Conservative Party that he will breach that by joining the probe. Senior MPs are worried that plotting against the Government could break the party's traditional red-wall advantage over the Tories in a next election. Strategists say No10 is prepared to fund the probe - and is waiting for data on the first wave of the bug before making a decision. A government source said: "They have been really attentive to the concerns raised by the backbenchers and are working on arrangements for the full restoration of normal availability."

<|startofarticle|> DOUBLE jabbed mums and dads will be able to take their unvaccinated kids on holiday this summer, The Sun can reveal. Plans to allow adults with two doses to travel in August to amber list countries are to be announced within days, with unjabbed family members exempt in a boost to late summer holidays. But ministers are under growing pressure to bring forward the plans to July 19 to save the school holidays on the continent. Earlier today Matt Hancock revealed that ministers were indeed looking at plans for whether double-vaccinated Brits might be able to avoid quarantine in future when they travel abroad. The Sun understands the new rules will mean under 16s will be able to go with their parents on holiday - but only if both parents have had two jabs. And it's likely they will have to wait two weeks after that for their protection to kick in - as is already the case in the EU travel rules. An announcement is expected as early as this week, alongside an update on the green, amber and red-list destinations. But as The Sun revealed yesterday, it's unlikely that many will be added - if any. It comes as: At the moment only people going to green-list countries are free once they return home from travelling - though they do have to take at least three PCR tests. Anyone coming back from an amber-list country has to quarantine for ten days at home. And those returning from a red-list destination have to stay in dedicated quarantine hotels, paying a whopping £1,750 for the privilege. Boris Johnson has been accused of letting Germans steal a march in the sunbed wars - as double-jabbed Brits still have to stay away from many beach destinations thanks to strict travel rules. Germans are free to travel and have wasted no time getting the towels down despite the EU's bungled jabs rollout and the country averaging more than 100 deaths a day. Scientists, MPs, travel bosses and holidaymakers last night warned Brits risk being left behind despite our plummeting death rate and the fact that almost all adults have had at least one vaccine shot. Mr Johnson did say the country was "looking good" for domestic unlocking on July 19 but he was downbeat about foreign holidays. Government adviser Professor Robert Dingwall, a public health expert at Nottingham Trent University who sits on the government's Nervtag advisory group, told The Sun last night that it was time to "stop jumping at shadows" and give Brits their holiday freedoms back. He said: "Fully vaccinated people should have freedom of movement, or as much freedom of movement as any other country will allow them. "We have a persistent misunderstanding of risk. If you're double vaccinated, there is very little risk to you from travelling anywhere else on the planet, because the vaccines would work just as well in Kathmandu as in Kenya. "The concern is that vaccines do not stop you getting a mild infection with some local variant. "If you bring it back into the country where pretty much everybody else is double vaccinated, they are all protected to the same extent that you are. "There's a failure to think this through from a risk management perspective perhaps rather than a public health perspective." Prof Karol Sikora, of the University of Buckingham, said: "It's cruel to ruin everyone's summer holiday for reasons which simply aren't backed up by the science. "Current travel restrictions will not stop new variants coming in anyway because the actual procedures are not rigorous enough. Cases will inevitably slip through. "The Government should either shut down the borders completely and not let anyone in, or open up travel for the rest of us. "It's no good preaching about the risks while allowing world leaders to enjoy a jolly on the beach in Cornwall." His plea was echoed by senior Conservative MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith, who urged: "Let's just get this all into some perspective and re-evaluate the risks faced by people." The former Tory leader warned: "We cannot totally eliminate the risk but the vaccines should be acknowledged as the game-changer they are. "There is no reason for the summer to be tough for people who have been double jabbed." Asked about the proposals to let double-jabbed Brits out of quarantine this morning, Mr Hancock said: "It is absolutely something we're working on, it's something I want to see. "We're working on plans to allow the vaccine to bring back some of the freedoms that have had to be restricted to keep people safe. "We'll get there when it's safe to do so. We want to do this right, we want to do this carefully and properly. "But of course we do want to get those freedoms back. That's the whole point of the vaccination programme. "When I'm in a position to be able to say something more concrete then we will do." A top Public Health England medic also hinted double-vaccinated Brits won't have to isolate after foreign trips in

<|startofarticle|> BRITAIN is getting back on its feet, Boris Johnson declared last night. The Prime Minister hailed the huge numbers of Brits returning to work and school. As millions of children headed for classrooms, an enthusiastic Mr Johnson thanked teachers, pupils and parents in playing their part for this "incredible country". And he vowed to do absolutely everything in his power to help get more workers back to their desks, insisting there would be no extension to the furlough scheme. Although warning there would be "more wretched Covid to come", Mr Johnson said he was "absolutely confident" Britain was on the road to recovery despite worrying images of empty commuter trains amid a sluggish return to towns and cities. Downing Street was unable to supply data on how many were back at work but more than 40 per cent of schools were finally reopened yesterday. And the Cabinet was back in Westminster for their first meeting since the summer break. The PM addressed a gathering of his top team around a socially distanced Cabinet table in the Foreign Office building. He said: "This is the first day back for us but across the country hundreds and thousands, millions of pupils are going back to school thanks to the huge efforts their teachers, their parents have made over the last few days and weeks. "People are going back to the office in huge numbers across our country and quite right, too. "Bit by bit, this incredible country is getting back on its feet and recovering from this crisis. "We, in this Government, are committed to trying to do everything in our power to help. That's what we have been doing over the last few months, and that's what we're going to continue to do." But Mr Johnson warned: "Of course, we know that there is still going to be more of this disease, this wretched Covid, still to come. "We know there will be more outbreaks — and we are absolutely confident that we are going to be able to deal with those outbreaks." After a torrid summer of U-turns, he used the first meeting to try to justify the chaos over free school meals, exam results and masks in schools. He told his ministers: "In the last few months, we've been sailing into the teeth of a gale, no question. "I am no great nautical expert but sometimes it is necessary to tack here and there in response to the facts as they change, in response to the wind's change. "But we have been going steadily in the direction, in the course we set out, and we have not been blown off that course." Yet, he insisted there would be no U-turn over the end of the furlough scheme which begins to wind down this month, despite pressure from MPs to extend it. The Job Retention Scheme set up in March paid furloughed workers 80 per cent of their wages from the public purse. That drops to 70 per cent this month and then 60 per cent in October before its planned conclusion on November 1. Labour and some senior Conservatives are calling for an extension to the scheme. Former Tory Cabinet Minister Stephen Crabb told HuffPost UK: "There are still many firms in different sectors that simply cannot operate in the current scenario. "There is a real danger that the unwinding of furlough will lead to the loss of thousands more high-value jobs "Germany, which knows all about retaining domestic industrial strength, has just decided to continue its furlough scheme for another 12 months." But last night the Treasury firmly slapped down the calls to extend the scheme. And Chancellor Rishi Sunak's firm stance was backed by Mr Johnson who said: "We have been clear that we cannot sustain the situation indefinitely. There isn't any change to the position." His official spokesman added: "By the time the furlough scheme ends, we will have paid wages for eight months saving 9.6 million jobs." The Treasury said: "The end of the furlough scheme is not the end of our support for jobs. For businesses that can successfully bring furloughed employees back to work, this includes a £1,000 job retention bonus." But the Institute for Public Policy Research think tank said ending the arrangement too quickly would be "an historic mistake". It added: "Reforming and extending the scheme now could prevent jobs losses and boost the economy in this time of need." The Treasury will today launch a £2billion Kickstart scheme to help the young unemployed into work. Employers can offer those aged 16 to 24 a six-month work placement even if they are claiming Universal Credit. By Matt Dathan, Deputy Political Editor GAVIN Williamson has insisted next summer's GCSE and A-level exams will go ahead as normal - but didn't rule out a short delay. The under-fire Education Secretary also said he was "deeply sorry" to school pupils who had their grades unfairly downgraded last month. He told MPs in the Commons: "We are determined that exams and assessments will go ahead next year, and we're

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson revealed the PM did not ask him to a 2020 Cabinet post in light of his controversies over No10 and the PM's hands-on approach to tackling climate change. In an interview with The Sun, the Prime Minister spoke of growing confidence in Britain's green credentials and said he was "very much in" talks with Whitehall about a future transition. The pair also said there were "no plans" for any future No10 games as the PM will be "winging the fleet" in the process. Mr Johnson said: "No, I think not. I'm still in the trenches, working on it, but it's something that I think about as a Prime Minister, having said that, as somebody who has been through the ups and downs of a couple of administrations, it's tough to imagine anything that could have that effect. "And so it makes your job very, very difficult. "But we're working on it, working on it, but it's something that I think about very, very well." Mr Johnson added: "I wish I'd had the judgment to do it differently. "But I do think it's important in these times of transition, because if we're talking about something as serious as coal, say, or levelling up across the whole of Europe, Northern Ireland or South East Asia, to think about using all means in every sense of the word to make sure that we are able to get those goals achieved." Plans were drawn up last night for a "virtual" consultation on transitioning to "virtual" cabinet rank, with Mr Johnson insisting he has received offers of help but not yet had the guts to take a stance. The focus is also on forking out any further powers that come from given up. Efforts to get members to be paid were similarly tussled with an existing plan to give the BBC the right to charge for certain shows and programmes. But the move will require elected members to show MPs the cash, potentially triggering investigations. The Prime Minister's own approval ratings are in the red for the nation, leaving the PM with no choice but to act. Yesterday, Mr Johnson's close ally Tessa Jowell told the BBC: "That is a post-pandemic Britain, America wanting to get its act together, to put up with creativity, because that is what this country needs." "I think the British Parliament and the Electorate want to do it, but they can't because they don't want to raise a barrier to entry." That could keep members up to six people together in "virtual" meetings. But senior Tories warned there could be a rebellion if the Prime Minister tries to force a vote. Rebel leader Mark Harper said: "I know how impatient people are to go back to the table. "There is a reason the British Parliament, and particularly the British people's right to choose, is relevant. "The Government should be making decisions about this very, very quickly. "It's not at a critical level yet. It's not a binary choice." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson and Carrie Symonds will put on a brave face to end the cruel twist of fate — and take the girls to America. The Prime Minister, 56, and his fiancée, 33, have protected the family since their son was tiny, but news of their son's impending suicide bomber mission made them swerve. They were initially supportive of the family, but the chance to see their son again sparked a backlash from his family. The couple, who have two children together, flew to New York last month to meet with the Justice Department's Hopefulsome Prosecution Office. Mr Johnson said: "They were incredible people. They answered all my emails, talked to me on a regular basis about how sorry we are for the crisis they have caused us, and how we could have made sure they could get away with this. "But obviously it turned out to be too much trouble. "I was fearful for the children. I was afraid they might not get back to their parents or the way they have changed since." The PM addressed the girls directly after they were passed out on the floor of the House of Lords, before telling them he "has been through worse". The girls, who are all over 30, have been identified by their families as the cause for concern in the aftermath of the tragedy. The letter, dated August 19, says: "Yours truly, SIRI-FLippy Ylenia Johnson" — but insisted the girls were not a threat to the Government. The letter continues: "They have not, however, 'murdered' or threatened to kill themselves. Threats are real and they are being addressed directly by your ministers." The letter continues: "The ASDA has established five individuals who may have directly or indirectly received a communication alleging that the PM has committed a security risk to the girls. The letter further states: "The letter alleges that one of the individuals may have directly or indirectly received a communication alleging that the PM has committed a security risk to the girls. The letter further states: "The letterers believe the communication is inherently offensive and contains a threat to public health."

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson is facing a growing rebellion from his own backbenchers to approve the entry-level mums and dads into the country's care system. Tonight 55% of Conservative backbenchers said they would back a new cap on the number of people over the age of 18 entering the system. The numbers showed there was a significant rise in support for a rise for families over the next three weeks. On the number of adults aged 18 to 29 in care homes, 55% stated they would definitely, or probably, object to the introduction. The Centre For Care Excellence data shows that the younger the child, the more likely they are to approve of the introduction of the rule. The survey found that 35% of 35- to 39-year-olds said they would definitely not be able to attend a care home compared to 35% of 35- to 39-year-olds who say they would definitely not like to be in there. The Centre also said that among under 18s, the approval rate is lower than the approval rate for the national average. 43 per cent of 35- to 39-year-olds said they would definitely not want to be in a care home compared to 31 per cent of 35- to 39-year-olds. Just 35 per cent of those aged 18 to 29 said they would definitely not want to be in a care home compared to 31 per cent of 35- to 39-year-olds. Just as important to remember, these attitudes are not limited to care home staff. It found that the approval rate for the Public Health England survey is significantly lower than the approval rate for the NASI poll, and is significantly higher than the approval rate for the ESN poll. Just 35 per cent of 35- to 39-year-olds say they would definitely or probably object to the introduction of the Rule of Six. That measure also says 64 per cent of 35- to 39-year-olds say they would definitely or probably object to the introduction of the Test and Traceable Massage regime. Mr Johnson's and Sir Keir's stance will require legislation to be introduced in the Commons, but both men have indicated they will back the testy proposal. Last night Downing Street did not comment on the Prime Minister's Cabinet Office's lobbying, but insisted the Government was clear on what was and wasn't behind the changes.

<|startofarticle|> LIZ Truss did a Margaret Thatcher yesterday — and climbed aboard the Normandy Royal yacht to welcoming President Trump to the doomed globe. The Foreign Secretary said the US President was "baffled" by the "devastating" diplomatic spat, but "I still stand by him" as Britain launched her historic trip. She said: "I voted for Brexit, I think he is a huge supporter of us and we have to work very hard to get rid of him. But after he made public made publically how deeply hurt he is by the abuse he's suffered and how everyone knows he's not the right fit for the job. "I don't think people want to work with someone who has made public statements like that. "I hope she gets the message across that he is not the right fit for the job and I hope she sentences him to the highest standards and calls it a day." Vote Conservative, save Truss, 33, and you can rip apart the Government. Vote Rexsburg, or I'll Throw in the towel and hope he's not drinking in the last Chance at All.

<|startofarticle|> RISHI Sunak's Budget was welcomed by Brits last night with more people thinking the policies announced were a good idea than bad, snap polling for The Sun showed. Pollsters Opinium found 52 per cent approve of the budget with 12 per cent disapproving – a net score of a whopping +40. And even controversial hikes to corporation tax and the freezing of income tax allowances were backed. 51 per cent thought the Budget was fair, with just 19 per cent thinking it is unfair. But less than one in five thought they would feel any positive effect on their household finances. 41 per cent approve of the way the government are handling the economy, compared to 35 per cent who disapprove – a net score of +6. Boris and Rishi have a 14 point lead when it comes to who the public most trust to run the nation's finances. But 64 per cent are worried about the state of the economy, an 44 per cent say it will only get worse next year. Most think it will take until 2023 to start improving. Last night Chris Curtis of Opinium said: "Sunak has pulled together a set of economic policies that aren't just seen as being good for the economy but, unlike many previous Conservative budgets, a majority of voters also describe as being fair. "First impressions don't always count for much with budgets, but for the moment at least, the Chancellor will be happy with the results showing a very positive initial reaction form the public." Opinium surveyed 1,708 people online on Wednesday afternoon.

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson and Carrie Symonds will "celebrate their wedding" next summer, The Sun can reveal. The Prime Minister, 56, and his fiancée, 33, have sent save-the-date cards to family and friends for the big night out in their town. The couple got engaged in late 2019 but, like thousands of other loved-up Brits, have had to delay plans because of Covid. Details of exactly where the couple will say "I do" remain a closely guarded secret, but pals say they are waiting until next year for a big celebration to be on the safe side. BoJo is expected to announce that the lockdown cap of 30 guests at weddings will be lifted next month. However, friends of the couple say the fight against the virus, and getting the country bouncing back from the pandemic, means this summer is too soon for their big knees-up. Early contenders as a location for the party include the PM's country pile Chequers in Buckinghamshire, or the Port Lympne safari park in Kent, where Carrie works. Last night a spokesman for the couple declined to comment on a "private family event". The only other PM to marry in office was Lord Liverpool who wed Mary Chester in 1822. Boris and Carrie were first seen together at a 2018 fundraiser. They have already become the first unmarried couple to live in Downing Street, moving there in July 2019. He reportedly proposed on holiday on the Caribbean island of Mustique, shortly after his landslide victory at December 2019's General Election. Commons sleazebusters are currently probing who exactly paid for the five-star trip amid a donations row. The engagement — and news that Carrie was expecting their first child — was announced publicly in late February 2020. The pandemic hit weeks later and the PM faced an intensive-care battle with Covid that April. Son Wilfred was born on April 29, 2020, and given the middle name Nicholas after two doctors who saved the PM's life. Mr Johnson has since remained tight-lipped about his wedding plans. Asked this March if he would be tying the knot when lockdown restrictions lift fully, the PM would only say to The Sun: "The wedding industry is certainly going to come roaring back in common with many other sectors of the economy." News of the pending nuptials will spark plenty of speculation about where the biggest political wedding in decades will be held. Wilfred was christened at Westminster Cathedral in central London in September. Boris also has access to Chequers, used by Prime Ministers as a retreat since the 1920s, and 40 miles from No10. He quit as Foreign Secretary in July 2018, days after a meeting at the estate in which then-PM Theresa May urged her warring Cabinet to hammer out a Brexit plan. Boris also used Chequers' 1,500 acres to convalesce following his virus battle. A source told The Sun tonight: "It would be nice for Chequers to be in the news for happy reasons for once." Looking to read more on the Prime Minister's life? We have you covered... The Port Lympne Reserve and hotel in Kent is also thought to be in the running for next summer's bash. Carrie works for conservation charity the Aspinall Foundation that runs the zoo, home to giraffes, zebras, rhinos and gorillas. The vast reserve also hosts quirky weddings as well as safari tours. Mr Johnson's own country house in his former constituency of Henley, Oxfordshire, could easily have played host to the bash — but it was recently rented out. Commons registers show the farmhouse near Thame is bringing in at least £10,000 a year in rental income. One estate agent's advert offers it for £4,250 a month. The PM also shares a farm and land in Devon with his siblings but it is not thought to be under consideration for the wedding. It had previously been reported that the pair could marry in Italy, where Carrie has relatives. But pals said that would be impractical with travel restrictions for a large party. Another option for the couple could be No10 Downing Street itself. It has plenty of vast state rooms and a large garden that could easily fit hundreds of guests. THE wedding will be the third for Boris — and Carrie's first. He tied the knot with first wife Allegra Mostyn-Owen in 1987. That marriage was annulled in 1993 — the same year he married Marina Wheeler. The couple had four children but separated in 2018. They formally divorced weeks before news emerged of Boris's engagement to Carrie. The only other PM to marry in office was Lord Liverpool who wed Mary Chester in 1822. His first wife Louisa, 54, died the previous year. Boris is also thought to be the first PM to divorce in office since Augustus FitzRoy, the 3rd Duke of Grafton. An act of Parliament allowed him to leave first wife Anne in 1769. He went on to marry Elizabeth Wrottesley
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson and Dominic Raab must "come absolutely clean" about when they learnt the killer of Harry Dunn was a secret US spy, the dead teenager's family have demanded. Lawyers representing American mum-of-three Anne Sacoolas sensationally admitted in a US Court that she was a intelligence agent. Sacoolas fled Britain after a fatal smash with the 19 year old motorcyclist outside RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire in August 2019. She was driving on the wrong side of the road but claimed diplomatic immunity as her husband worked at the US spy base. But on Wednesday night,  the Alexandria district court in Virginia was told Anne Sacoolas was "employed by an intelligence agency in the US" at the time of the fatal  collision - which was "especially a factor" in her flight from the UK. Her lawyer said she fled the country due to "issues of security". The Sun understands she had a "high flying career" in the CIA. The bombshell revelations came out during Sacoolas's bid to dismiss a civil claim for damages against her made by the late Harry's family. The suspect's lawyer, John McGavin, told the court he could not "completely candidly" explain why the Sacoolas family left the UK - adding: "I know the answer, but I cannot disclose it." Sacoolas's career in espionage was first revealed by the Press last year, but the US or UK government have never commented - and Sacoolas herself had remained tight lipped until now. Harry's grieving family have been kept in the dark for more than a year by the Foreign Office despite many pleas for information. Last night the family said Harry's father asked the Foreign Secretary "point blank in a meeting" at the FCO in January 2020 whether or not Mrs Sacoolas was working at the time of the crash. But Mr Raab's response was that "she used to work for the State Department." The family's spokesman Radd Seiger told The Sun: "We now call on Mr Johnson and his team to come absolutely clean to the parents and the British public about what he knew about Mrs Sacoolas' employment status, when he became aware of it." "And what are the British Government is now going to do following this astonishing revelation to help the parents once and for all to get Justice for Harry?" And Harry's mum Charlotte Charles told ITV News: "I'll never trust any of them again." And she said Mr Johnson "should completely reevaluate the position he holds." "It's beyond belief, the amount of times we've met with them," she said. "We should have been properly grieving in those first few months, we should have been given the chance. We deserve the truth. Who the hell have we got running the country?" Both President Trump and President Biden have rejected British requests to extradite her back to face justice. Probed on whether the US had "pulled a fast one" on the UK over withholding information about Sacoolas from the government, No10 told reporters: "we don't comment on intelligence matters". But a spokesman insisted "she was notified to the UK Government by the US as a spouse with no official role". "I would emphasise that our position on this case remains unchanged, we have consistently called for her diplomatic immunity to be waived and believe that the US refusal to extradite her amounts to a denial of justice." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson told Emmanuel Macron to "get a grip" last night as he compared France's meltdown over the new UK, US and Aussie defence deal to the behaviour of a jilted lover. In a meeting at the brilliant French defence minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, the PM branded his new US and Australian defence deals "glad tidings of the good old days". He said: "It is now well and truly past time that the UK and the US remain the firstlineacies for globalization in Europe." And he suggested the new AUKUS agreement would be a "show of force" as it would cement Britain's status as a global trader. He told the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation: "It is a recognition that many diseases do not developed from a single vaccine, and therefore it is vital that we get our hands on a vaccine. "If we are to find the single cause for these days when the world is still reeling from the worst Covid pandemic since the Second World War, vaccination must be the first line of defence." He added: "The vaccine has changed the nature of this pandemic. "It has made vaccines more widely available. "And it has made vaccine passports more widely available. "It has made the trade more attractive. More people are going to be able to take part in the trade." Glancing at the chart below, it is clear that the pandemic is far from over. The pandemic is far from over. The vaccines are weeks away, and many countries are still left with no effective vaccine stocks after the Government's failure to stop the tide of European amber certification of Pfizer. Addressing the United Nations General Assembly there last month, President Biden said: "We cannot afford to keep exporting these vaccines to the United States. "It's a national security risk, but we must be careful about exporting critical medicines that could be used to kill people." His plea was echoed by senior Conservative spokesman Andrew Mitchell, who urged: "Cutting this huge sum off a child's life is a killer effect. It's better than being in a bomb factory." And Tobias Ellwood, MP for Northampton South, added: "The Government needs to cut this huge trade deal off so we can export these medicines to the United States. "It's a national security risk, but we must be careful about exporting these medicines to the United States." BREXIT will be a roaring success — only if we grasp its golden new opportunities. So it would be insane not to sign the free trade deal with Australia negotiated by Liz Truss. It is the first that isn't just a tweaked and improved version of what we had under the EU. But it is fiercely resisted by those, some in the Cabinet, who claim imports will harm our farmers. Rubbish. Not only will they have a decade before it is fully implemented — but can they really not compete with Aussie rivals who operate to similarly exacting standards and have to ship their meat 10,000 miles? We must sign this deal and one with New Zealand too. Both will mean cheaper grub for millions. Leaving the EU was about taking back control of our laws, money and borders while opening Britain up to the world for trade. The "full fat" Brexit we did handed us total freedom to do so. What a catastrophic signal it will send if "global Britain" rejects its first brand-new trade deal and pulls up the drawbridge. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson and Joe Biden will put reopening UK-US travel top of the agenda when they finally meet today. The US President landed in Britain last night ahead of this weekend's G7 summit in Cornwall — on his first foreign visit in office. Air Force One touched down at RAF Mildenhall, Suffolk, just before 8pm where Mr Biden, 78, and his wife Gill, 70, addressed US troops as they began their eight-day trip to Europe. Mr Biden said his visit would show that "the United States is back" and democracies are standing together. He added that as founding members of Nato, the US and UK were part of the "strongest military and political alliance in history" — but warned it needed to be "modernised" to protect against new challenges. He is set to meet Mr Johnson today when they will discuss resuming flights. They were stopped more than 400 days ago because of the pandemic. The leaders will also forge a post-Brexit accord focusing on global health, climate change and Covid recovery. It will mirror the Atlantic Charter signed in 1941 by the then British PM and US President, Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Mr Johnson said: "While Churchill and Roosevelt faced the question of how to help the world recover following a devastating war, today we have to reckon with a very different but no less intimidating challenge — how to build back better from the coronavirus pandemic. "Co-operation between the UK and US, the closest of partners and the greatest of allies, will be crucial for the future of the world's stability and prosperity." PRESIDENT Biden would be a disaster for Britain, gleeful Remainers claimed. His Irish ancestry left him ill-disposed to us. He hated Brexit and loved the EU, which he would always prioritise. The US would never do a trade deal with us. Worse still, the Democrats disliked Boris, who was just Donald Trump with a British accent. And so on and so on. Now, after months of warmth, the two leaders will today forge a historic new transatlantic pact. Do the Boris-haters call anything right? Mr Biden, who will meet the Queen at Windsor after the summit, has said one aim of his trip was to show China and Russia that the Western alliance is strong. He will leave the UK for Brussels for talks with EU and Nato chiefs, before meeting Russia's Vladimir Putin. Heads of state from France, Germany, Canada, Italy and Japan will also be at the G7 summit at Carbis Bay.

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson and Rishi Sunak will slash the UK's bloated foreign aid budget to fill the Covid blackhole, The Sun can reveal. The Prime Minister, 56, and Chancellor Rishi Sunak, 60, have long complained the International Aid budget is too big and too heavy. They want to be able to do just that with the help of the Hughes Institute for Foreign Policy and Development. The think tank is trying to shore up support in the Tory party for a virtual election ahead of April's General Election. But the UK's Treasury has told The Sun it does not recognise Labour's demand that the aid budget be reduced in half by the end of the decade. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> FEWER than seven in 100 violent crimes saw anyone charged last year, damning data shows. That has plummeted from more than one in five suspected crimes heading to a courtroom just six years ago. Almost 1.67 million violent offences were reported to have taken place in the year to March 2021 but just 139,805 thugs faced the rap. In 238,000 of the crimes probed by cops, no suspect was even identified. Of 55,227 robberies reported, just 6,800 charges were brought, with no suspect identified in more than two thirds of cases. The Home Office stats for England and Wales out this week, detail charge rates for violent offences dived from 22 per cent in 2014/15 to just 6.8 per cent in 2020/21. Shockingly the charge rate for rape has hit just 1.5 per cent of those reported. Sarah Jones, shadow policing minister, said: "Under Conservatives, criminals have never had it so good. "It is shocking so many crimes don't even lead to a charge and victims of the most serious violent offences, like rape, are being denied justice. "Labour would put victims first, boost community policing and bring criminals to justice." The Home Office said the pandemic has "significantly affected" crime figures with a 13 per cent fall in total police recorded crime, excluding fraud. While theft stats plunged in lockdown, there was no reduction in violent crimes. But officials insist year-on-year comparisons have been made more "challenging" by the impact of Covid. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> MILITANT teachers are threatening to shut schools if local coronavirus cases hit 50 in 100,000. But the latest union attempt to halt a return to the classroom was branded a "hard-left wrecking ball to our children's futures". The demand would currently see pupils not back at desks in cities and towns including Bradford, Blackburn and Oldham, with Swindon and Rochdale also nudging the cut-off point. The Education Solidarity Network, a left-wing faction in the National Education Union, will hold street protests on Friday across Britain with a list of safety demands such as free PPE and weekly Covid tests for teachers. And it announced tonight it wants to be able to close classrooms if local infection rates hit its chosen level. ESN boss and secondary school teacher James Kerr said: "We have already lost colleagues to the virus and will lose more if there is not action." He added: "It's not the Victorian era anymore. Every worker should be able to go to work in the knowledge that they will return alive and well." More moderate bosses of the biggest teachers unions distanced themselves from the ESN's cut-off figure. But they warned: "We have to prepare for a range of possible scenarios — including pupils and teachers having to isolate." The NEU's spokesman added: "We are pressing the Government on the need to have a robust track, trace and test programme in place and a Plan B in the case of local lockdowns or a second spike." PM Boris Johnson has said schools will be the last thing to close even in areas experiencing a resurgence of the virus. And today a key ally rejected the latest plot by organised teachers and urged Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to do the same. Conservative Party co-chairman Amanda Milling hit out: "This hard-left action takes a wrecking ball to our children's futures. "Sir Keir Starmer and the NEU need to take a stand and put a stop to this action that puts the future of so many young people at risk. "Getting children back to school is a key priority and we should all be working together to get pupils back safely. "We have a detailed plan and it's time for Labour and the NEU to work with us to ensure the life chances of a generation of schoolchildren — particularly the most disadvantaged — are not lost to coronavirus." But a Labour source warned that schools reopening risked being a "fiasco" like exam results due to blundering ministers. The row came as senior Tories warned Gavin Williamson is "on his last life" and will be swiftly sacked if the reopening of schools is botched. The embattled Education Secretary has defied calls to quit from opposition parties following the A-levels grading scandal. But No10 does not dispute Mr Williamson offered to fall on his sword. Fellow Cabinet ministers and MPs have told The Sun he would not survive another scandal next month if he botches Mr Johnson's flagship pledge to reopen schools. Senior Tories reject claims Boris is protecting the ex-Chief Whip who helped organise the PM's party takeover — amid fears he "not only buried all the bodies but still has the shovel". One Government insider said: "Gavin talks a good game but the People's Government will not be blackmailed by anyone." The warnings came as Health Secretary Matt Hancock hinted Mr Williamson had not been given the boot because of his crucial role in implementing the PM's promise to parents that pupils will be back at the start of the new term. Mr Hancock told Sky News: "The big focus is on getting schools back and open at the start of next month, an incredibly important task. "I don't think we should be distracted from that task now. We need to absolutely focus on it." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson hailed new President Joe Biden as a "fantastic thing for America" as he tried to cement close early ties with the new administration. The Prime Minister will welcome the new leader of the free world to Britain twice this year - and was already rolling out the red carpet last night. Taking aim at the departed Donald Trump, Mr Johnson said it had been "a bumpy period and for us and America." After watching Mr Biden being sworn in on TV from his office at 10 Downing Street, the PM said: "It's a big moment, we've got things we want to do together." He pointed to tackling climate change and added: "we've got to bounce back from Covid together, working together to unite the world in how you tackle a pandemic." Mr Johnson's gushing praise came after he told his Cabinet that Brexit Britain will be Mr Biden's go to trouble-shooter in the West. The PM has pitched the UK as "a strong steward of the international system and a pragmatic and problem-solving partner on the world stage". Yesterday the Queen joined Mr Johnson in welcoming the hand over of power in Washington, as Mr Johnson welcoming strong US leadership in another swipe at outgoing President Trump. The PM said there is now a "fantastic joint united agenda" between the UK and US governments and the pair share a favourite slogan: "build back better". President Biden is due to visit the UK twice in 2021 for major summits in a boost for Mr Johnson's hopes for a close working relationship. Downing Street insiders say the UK hosting the G7 this summer and a major UN climate summit COP26 means virtual meetings with the new administration will begin almost immediately. Mr Johnson also hopes to work with closely with President Biden on China, Iran and the wider Middle East where he was at odds with President Trump. Risking accusations of neediness, yesterday ministers queued up to heap praise on the new White House boss. Home Secretary Priti Patel declared its time to "move on'' from the Trump era, while Trade Secretary Liz Truss rushed to reopen deal talks with the new US team. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab gushed: "From climate change to trade and security, our two countries share a close bond and special relationship. We look forward to working with you on shared priorities as a force for good in the world." Labour's Sir Keir Starmer also heaped glowing praise on the new President, saying: "The US begins a new chapter in its history, one of hope, decency, compassion and strength. "Together, our two nations can build a better, more optimistic future for our world", he added. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> RISHI Sunak's Budget next week will be an expensive and painful sandwich of giveaways and tax hikes. Insiders are calling it "two big slices of bread with very thin jam". Slice one is a £30billion Covid support bundle that will see furlough, business relief, the Universal Credit uplift and stamp duty holiday all extended to June. Doing this for three months more, to bring those measures in line with the Government's programme for coming out of lockdown, leaves "thin jam" — or little to spend elsewhere. Slice two is a painful package of tax hikes to start raising billions to close the UK's budget deficit, which will hit £400billion by April. Experts say that needs reducing by around £30-40billion now to stabilise borrowing and prevent debt from rising as a percentage of national income. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said: "Even if the government was comfortable with stabilising debt at 100 per cent of national income — its highest level since 1960 — it would still need a fiscal tightening worth 2.1 per cent of national income, or £43billion." In a bid to prove to the world that Britain's spending is not out of control, Chancellor Mr Sunak will likely announce a hike in corporation taxes — up to as much as 25 per cent from 19 per cent over a number of years. Raising capital gains will target the rich, such as second-home owners. A government source said: "Action needs to be taken now, not in November and not next year, but now. "The Budget will make a start on that stabilisation. It can't go the whole way in one fiscal event but it will make a start." Covid spending means "thin jam" for other giveaways. Mr Sunak is under pressure to keep the freeze on fuel duty rises and give a lockdown recovery gift of slashed booze levies plus allocating cash for infrastructure plans in the North. Labour has insisted: "Now is not the time for tax rises for families or businesses." WE couldn't believe our ears. Who was this politician yesterday, soundly agreeing with The Sun that "now is not the time for tax rises for businesses"? None other than Sir Keir, the Starmer chameleon. A little more than a year ago,  this same man campaigned to install  mega-taxing, business-wrecking, Brexit- reversing Marxists in Downing Street. Yet here he was, for once making sense. Sadly, Chancellor Rishi Sunak seems focused on tax hikes to whittle down the vast Covid debt. We sympathise. But we're not minded to back any. We will shed the fewest tears about owners of multiple homes paying more capital gains tax when they flog them. But increasing corporation tax now, when Britain desperately needs firms to step up to the plate and create jobs, is madness. Does it not bother the Treasury to be plotting tax rises even Labour baulks at? Pleas not to hike fuel duty — backed by The Sun's Keep It Down crusade — come as a new eco-petrol is sanctioned for use at UK pumps. Ministers signed off plans for E10 — a mix of petrol and ethanol made from materials including grains, sugars and waste wood — from September. The cut in emissions will be like taking 350,000 cars off our roads.

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson will today hand 800,000 doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab to Kenya, The Sun can reveal. The UK's key ally in the East Africa is starting to arm its population — largely through the Kenya Vaccination Organisation (NVI) that it has worked with. Kenya also helped train the British-educated jabs $70 million bordello. Jabs are given to about 2,000 high schools in 47 countries, including the UK. But £95 million of UK funding has been used to fund the programme since 2012 to try to help the pandemic train more people. Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta last night hailed the decision as "a fantastic boost for the UK/Kenyatta bilateral relationship." And he said it will provide "enhancement for a whole lot of people of colour in the UK and for the whole world to see". The decision will allow the UK and Kenya to work out more about the other's new nuclear+red zone, and will also allow the UK Government's agreement to the Australian settlement to go side-by-side. Mr Johnson said: "It is obviously an amazing boost for the UK's and Kenya's bilateral relationship, as they have done quite a lot over the last year. "And also a sign that China and the US are beginning to come to terms, because it is so important that the whole of the x86 system is based on i9, so there will be no upset or differences." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson has been warned Sinn Fein will sweep to power in Northern Ireland and break up the UK if he does not fix the row over Brexit border checks. DUP heavyweight Ian Paisley Jr says further delay will only "embolden republicans in Northern Ireland and those who want to rip us out of the United Kingdom." Britain is at loggerheads with Brussels over the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol that forces checks on goods travelling from the mainland to Ulster. Mr Johnson has threatened to trigger the emergency Article 16 break clause to suspend the rules claiming they are crippling trade - but is locked in talks with the EU to try avoid having to do so. But Mr Paisley, MP for North Antrim, has warned time is running out to come good on that threat - or risk nationalists romping to victory in next year's elections in the province. The unionist big wig told The Sun that Mr Johnson risks going down in history as as a terrible PM's if he goes soft on his tough talk. Amid growing Cabinet concerns that the PM has "gone wobbly", Mr Paisley says Sinn Fein are on the march and risk seizing control of Stormont if the standoff continues much longer - opening the door to years of wrangling over Irish unification. He hit out: "This is a do or die moment for the Prime Minister. The past 12 months have cost Northern Ireland dearly. "Triggering Article 16 is long overdue. It is a legitimate and proportionate response to the failed Protocol that has disrupted internal UK trade, inflated internal UK costs, created political unrest and tensions here are festering. "So long as Boris Johnson sticks by this failing status quo, he will only embolden republicans in Northern Ireland and those who want to rip us out of the United Kingdom. "Let's be clear PM if this situation continues unchanged Sinn Fein are in poll position to capitalise electorally. "And they will be given a platform to demand Ulster's removal from the Union. Is that the outcome you can stomach, Boris? "I say to the Prime Minister, the alarm is sounding. The Union is being undermined. It's time to act. "Take back control of the entire United Kingdom or history will not be kind to your stewardship of the Union." Yesterday Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he is an "optimist" when it comes to the prospect of a deal with the EU on the Protocol, but triggering Article 16 is still on the table as "substantive gaps" remain between the two sides. He struck a hopeful tone after Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said on Wednesday that reaching an agreement on the protocol before Christmas was "unrealistic". Brexit minister Lord Frost previously said both the UK and the EU wanted the dispute "settled one way or the other" before the winter. A government spokesman said: "The bottom line is that the EU's proposals don't go far enough to address the real problems facing people in Northern Ireland because of the Protocol. "We're clear we'd rather agree solutions, but if we can't we'll have to use the safeguard provisions in the Protocol to preserve stability in Northern Ireland instead. "The EU urgently needs to show more realism and flexibility if we are going to find an agreed way through."

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson today unveiled a massive raid on shareholder profits to raise billions for the NHS and Social Care. The PM today revealed a 1.25 per cent hike to National Insurance contributors from workers and firms today - as well as a new tax assault on investors. Cabinet sources say people paid in dividends will be double-jabbed from today on - meaning the government will have to spend more cash on the NHS, social care and pension plans. The PM and Chancellor Rishi Sunak will hope the move will offset claims that their raid on workers' wages is unfair as well as raise additional billions every year to plug fiscal black-holes in both the NHS and social care budgets. Boris said in his Commons statement: "We will be asking better-off business owners and investors to make a fair contribution too. "In fact, the highest earning 14 per cent will pay around half the revenues, no-one earning less than £9,568 will pay a penny, and the majority of small businesses will be protected, with 40 per cent of all businesses paying nothing at all." But the move is likely to trigger an angry backlash from Tory MPs who claim to be the party of capitalism. Boris Johnson today broke a key election promise by hitting millions with more taxes. He confirmed: 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson wants to create county "sheriffs" with the same powers as big city mayors. The PM suggested these local leaders could have control over policing, travel and planning as part of his "Levelling Up" agenda. The former Mayor of London offered scant detail yesterday of how his plan would work in unveiling proposals that would take powers from Westminster. He even asked in his speech in Coventry for punters to email him with a name for the new politicians — with social media quick to brand them sheriffs. But the PM told the UK Battery Industrialisation Centre it was time to "rewrite the rule book" and to take a "more flexible approach to devolution" in England. He said towns should get "the tools to make things happen for their communities". And Mr Johnson argued: "There is no reason why our great counties cannot benefit from the same powers we've devolved to city leaders." But he cautioned it could yet come back to haunt the Tories if left-wing and Labour leaders seized control. The PM got into hot water last year for branding devolution to Scotland a "disaster" and has had battles with Labour mayors such as Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham on Covid. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called the ideas "all soundbites and no substance". Mr Johnson also took aim at Dominic Cummings. He vowed to stick to his goal of rebalancing Britain, after the ex-No10 aide called the PM a "shopping trolley" veering in different directions. Mr Cummings wrote on his blog the speech was a "joke". 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson and Carrie Symonds will "celebrate their wedding" next summer, The Sun can reveal. The Prime Minister, 56, and his fiancée, 33, have sent save-the-date cards to family and friends for a lavish bash on Saturday, July 30, 2022. The couple got engaged in late 2019 but, like thousands of other loved-up Brits, have had to delay plans because of Covid. Details of exactly where the couple will say "I do" remain a closely guarded secret, but pals say they are waiting until next year for a big celebration to be on the safe side. BoJo is expected to announce that the lockdown cap of 30 guests at weddings will be lifted next month. However, friends of the couple say the fight against the virus, and getting the country bouncing back from the pandemic, means this summer is too soon for their big knees-up. Early contenders as a location for the party include the PM's country pile Chequers in Buckinghamshire, or the Port Lympne safari park in Kent, where Carrie works. Last night a spokesman for the couple declined to comment on a "private family event". The only other PM to marry in office was Lord Liverpool who wed Mary Chester in 1822. Boris and Carrie were first seen together at a 2018 fundraiser. They have already become the first unmarried couple to live in Downing Street, moving there in July 2019. He reportedly proposed on holiday on the Caribbean island of Mustique, shortly after his landslide victory at December 2019's General Election. Commons sleazebusters are currently probing who exactly paid for the five-star trip amid a donations row. The engagement — and news that Carrie was expecting their first child — was announced publicly in late February 2020. The pandemic hit weeks later and the PM faced an intensive-care battle with Covid that April. Son Wilfred was born on April 29, 2020, and given the middle name Nicholas after two doctors who saved the PM's life. Mr Johnson has since remained tight-lipped about his wedding plans. Asked this March if he would be tying the knot when lockdown restrictions lift fully, the PM would only say to The Sun: "The wedding industry is certainly going to come roaring back in common with many other sectors of the economy." News of the pending nuptials will spark plenty of speculation about where the biggest political wedding in decades will be held. Wilfred was christened at Westminster Cathedral in central London in September. Boris also has access to Chequers, used by Prime Ministers as a retreat since the 1920s, and 40 miles from No10. He quit as Foreign Secretary in July 2018, days after a meeting at the estate in which then-PM Theresa May urged her warring Cabinet to hammer out a Brexit plan. Boris also used Chequers' 1,500 acres to convalesce following his virus battle. A source told The Sun tonight: "It would be nice for Chequers to be in the news for happy reasons for once." Looking to read more on the Prime Minister's life? We have you covered... The Port Lympne Reserve and hotel in Kent is also thought to be in the running for next summer's bash. Carrie works for conservation charity the Aspinall Foundation that runs the zoo, home to giraffes, zebras, rhinos and gorillas. The vast reserve also hosts quirky weddings as well as safari tours. Mr Johnson's own country house in his former constituency of Henley, Oxfordshire, could easily have played host to the bash — but it was recently rented out. Commons registers show the farmhouse near Thame is bringing in at least £10,000 a year in rental income. One estate agent's advert offers it for £4,250 a month. The PM also shares a farm and land in Devon with his siblings but it is not thought to be under consideration for the wedding. It had previously been reported that the pair could marry in Italy, where Carrie has relatives. But pals said that would be impractical with travel restrictions for a large party. Another option for the couple could be No10 Downing Street itself. It has plenty of vast state rooms and a large garden that could easily fit hundreds of guests. THE wedding will be the third for Boris — and Carrie's first. He tied the knot with first wife Allegra Mostyn-Owen in 1987. That marriage was annulled in 1993 — the same year he married Marina Wheeler. The couple had four children but separated in 2018. They formally divorced weeks before news emerged of Boris's engagement to Carrie. The only other PM to marry in office was Lord Liverpool who wed Mary Chester in 1822. His first wife Louisa, 54, died the previous year. Boris is also thought to be the first PM to divorce in office since Augustus FitzRoy, the 3rd Duke of Grafton. An act of Parliament allowed him to leave first wife Anne in 1769. He went on to marry Elizabeth W

The PM today revealed a 1.25 per cent hike to National Insurance contributors from workers and firms today - as well as a new tax assault on investors. Cabinet sources say people paid in dividends will still be allowed a personal allowance before the the new tax hike kicks in, with only the most profitable investors affected. The PM and Chancellor Rishi Sunak will hope the move will offset claims that their raid on workers' wages is unfair as well as raise additional billions every year to plug fiscal black-holes in both the NHS and social care budgets.

<|startofarticle|> DOMINIC Cummings' boast to be "on the way back" from Covid was branded a "veteran." The No10 aide who tried to force-feed Boris Johnson into pencilling in top mates Glen Johnson and David Warner was branded a "veteran" and a "serial offender" on terror charges. The Home Secretary and MP for Devizes, South Devon, also called the missed opportunity to save pal Glen Johnson "a talented young man" after the pair called the Chancellor's wife a "loony". Davis also stood by his former Brexit aide, who asked not to be named about the case. At the time the former No10 chief executive as well as a close pal of his ex-mentor, Mr Johnson was facing a growing rebellion from his own team over his handling of the crisis. One senior figure claimed: "I don't want anyone to become a sniper or a drug lord, but if you don't take back control you will be in trouble." Another compared the treatment of the Johnson family by the PM following their failure to direct action against the Russian agent who was behind the No10 text message leak. The MP said: "Take a deep breath and think of the people who have gone through the turmoil that this has caused. Think of the people who were like, 'Oh my gosh, this is ridiculous. This is beyond belief. This is beyond belief. This is beyond belief. This is beyond belief. This is beyond belief. This is beyond belief. This. This is beyond belief. This!'" It is not the first time Mr Cummings has been accused of acting on his word. In March, he was found to have misled the Commons about the extent of the damage from the No10 renovations. And in February the aide was found to have committed a criminal offence in the UK — admitting to misleading Parliament and engaging in a number of other "sordid allegations" against a senior colleague. Mr Cummings left No10 last November and the ongoing investigation into the saga has been dubbed the "chameleon" disease saga. It involves the Home Office, the Defence Ministry, the Health and Social Care Ministry and the Trade Department. Last night a Home Office spokesman said: "The matter was referred to the police for investigation." The spokesman added: "Any allegations of child exploitation or any other criminal activity are completely unacceptable and will be dealt with in accordance with the law." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson has let rip at fellow world leaders and accused them of shirking their green duty. In a meeting at the United Nations, the PM said he was "increasingly frustrated" that their commitments to tackle the climate crisis are "nowhere near enough". And he said there was a "vast" gap between what the richest nations on the planet had pledged - and what they had actually coughed up in hard cash. The PM is in New York to crack the whip on a global green deal at the UK-hosted Cop26 in November. But he said there was only a "six out of ten" chance he would be able to shake the tin enough to meet his £100billion pledge to help poorer nations make the switch to clean energy. Co-hosting a discussion at the UN General Assembly, the Prime Minister noted that "everyone nods and we all agree that something must be done". "Yet I confess I'm increasingly frustrated that the 'something' to which many of you have committed is nowhere near enough," he said. "It is the biggest economies in the world that are causing the problem, while the smallest suffer the worst consequences. "And while progress is being made all over the world, the gulf between what has been promised, what is actually being delivered, and what needs to happen... it remains vast. "Too many major economies - some represented here today, some absent - are lagging too far behind." Urging counterparts to "step up", the PM finished: "So you can look away, you can do the minimum, you can hope that if you feed the crocodile enough it will devour you last. Or you can show leadership." Global leaders have already agreed that there is a £100billion price tag to wean the poorest nations off of dirty polluting fossil fuels; but there are fears the money actually pledged by rich nations will full far short of that total. Earlier the PM slammed UK eco-warriors for blockading the M25 motorway - bringing traffic to a standstill and infuriating commuters. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson has been warned Sinn Fein will sweep to power in Northern Ireland and break out to take back the North -replace it with a "disaster-iral" Brexit Britain. The UK-US trade deal is set to sail through the Commons with a simple majority to confirm Key Minister Simon Case's assessment too. The EU and US negotiators had been said to be on the same page on the eve of a crucial vote on the deal as they mulled the prospect of a breakthrough. But a Whitehall source told The Sun: "The exit side was pushing for a major trade deal but were rebuffed because the other side was 'too big for our country]". The US delegation flew home on Thursday after only one week in Brussels, with Mr Johnson assuring them that there would be "more reasonable terms" for Britain to reach despite the chaos. The leaders flew to Washington DC on Thursday for their first phone call since the failure of the first attempt last week. Monday's deadline for a breakthrough with the EU moving through a formal transition bill HMG for the UK is now set to be Thursday. Mr Johnson said after the snag: "I don't think we should be making compromises at all. "I think what we need to do is make sure that we are able to get the job of making sure that the UK is able to get its act together and, ultimately, the world can get its act together and get Covid right." The PM hosted a cocktail reception at the UK's Hilton Garden Inn on Monday night before his flight home on Tuesday. Mr Johnson said: "I'm convinced that if we get it right, as I'm sure we can, we can have a superpower." And he said he would push for more generous terms than were negotiated, in a bid to win over Western allies to the UK's defence. But he warned the EU to be "robust" on the terms demanded - and warned Washington would be "deceived" if he threatened to pull the plug on bilateral ties if agreed. The UK and US have priority over free trade deals in particular for our young athletes, Mr Johnson said. He told the gathered VIPs: "I want this deal to go smoothly through the Commons and, ultimately, the Government so that we can have a strong and irreversible approach to the deal." Hopes of a breakthrough with the EU on the deal were fading yesterday after fierce resistance from Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith. Work and Pensions Secretary Kemi Al Hindurst said she was "passionate" about the issue but was downbeat about the UK's chances of success. The hardline sparked further row over the Aussie government's failure to stop the boats from entering the Channel. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson is facing a growing Tory mutiny as the party's newbies unite with old guard MPs to warn the PM to "get a grip". Five MPs from the 2019 intake are now thought to have written letters to demand Mr Johnson quits. It comes after a torrid week for the PM, engulfed in Christmas Party fury and the ongoing wallpaper-gate saga. Yesterday, Mr Johnson was in frantic talks with his anti-sleaze adviser, who demanded evidence to explain discrepancies in the PM's story about the No 10 flat redecoration. Lord Geidt, the PM's independent adviser on standards, probed the spruce-up earlier this year. But new evidence has emerged that Mr Johnson may have known the true source of decorating donations earlier than he claimed. Lord Geidt is said to be "furious and humiliated". And last night he was understood to be considering relaunching the probe. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson's senior spin doctor, Jack Doyle, offered to resign over the ongoing row after last year's lockdown-breaking wine and cheese event for No 10 staff. Adviser Allegra Stratton has already quit over the do after a mocking video was leaked. It comes as the PM's personal rating fell by 11 points in less than a month — with YouGov finding his approval score at a new low of -41. MPs have been spotted going to see backbench boss Sir Graham Brady to demand a leadership election. Last week The Sun reported as many as a dozen Tory MPs want a change of leader, still far short of the 56 required to formally trigger a contest. But one angry minister hit back at the Tory newbies, saying: "It doesn't take long before these kids forget who got them their seat." Ex-Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell has urged the PM to get a grip to keep his job. He told Times Radio: "I hope he will still be Prime Minister in a year — but if Downing Street don't get a grip and start to deliver the governance many of my colleagues are talking about openly, then the PM will be in considerable trouble." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BRITAIN is being hit by "the single most catastrophic crisis" in its history. The furlough scheme is being used to fund the "catastrophic" black hole in social care. The Conservative-led government has been accused of "one rule for them, one compromise" to get through last week. Cut off from care homes and early care homes will get a pay cut as a result - but will continue to receive millions in the form of the furlough scheme. The scheme was designed in part to help help social care staff find work, but can be stretched to the breaking point. It will be phased in to help social workers find new jobs and the furlough scheme will end. President of the Royal College of GPs Dr Jeremy Bowen said: "GPs rely on people to keep them going. People are using our sites to work out what's wrong with them, and to get people back to help keep the NHS running. "We need to be clear however that if we are to get rid of the furlough scheme we will need to rethink how we help people pay their wages, and that is not something we are going to agree with GPs." He added: "We will also need to rethink how we budget our public health and social care." The Sunday Mirror reported that the rise in people using illicit drugs in the past 12 months was "up 66,000 points since the middle of last year compared to the same period last year". Another 215,000 new cases were recorded in the four days to October 3 - the highest spread since the end of April. People were also able to download the latest polio jab for those spots, as well as the pandemic lockdown-running furlough scheme. But last night the NHS defended the work-plants programme, saying: "People are getting better and better at carrying out their duties. "We're always looking for new ways to help people make the most of their lives." ALTERNATIVE FISH FISH: WHAT can we do to make things more friendly?

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson will today hand 800,000 doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab to Kenya, The Sun can reveal. The UK's key ally in the East Africa has currently only vaccinated about 2 per cent of its population. Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta flew into London last night with the pair due to meet at Chequers this afternoon where they will announce the life-saving gift. The AZ jabs are make up the first tranche of 100 million doses the UK vowed to share with poorer countries at June's G7 through the global Covax programme. It's understood other countries set to received doses from Britain will be unveiled in the coming weeks, with Mr Johnson promising the UK will donate 5 million doses by the end of September. The UK helped to establish the international Covax jab effort last year and is its fourth-biggest donor, pledging £548 million to the scheme. Last night a senior government source said: "It's right that as the UK continues our world-beating vaccine rollout at home, we support other countries to get the pandemic under control. "No one is safe from this virus until we're all safe." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> LONDON health chiefs are on standby to start taking deliveries of Covid vaccine stocks from next week, The Sun can reveal. Health sources say staff at a major London hospital trust have been told to be ready to receive the first batches of the Oxford Astra-Zenica jab from "week commencing the 2 November." The vaccine is still in testing, but a major effort has been ordered to have the world-leading hospital ready to go as soon as it is given the green light. The Sun has learnt other clinical trials at the famous hospital have been paused as all resources go toward preparing to vaccinate thousands of doctors, nurses and other frontline staff. And extra security measures are being planned over fears of anti-vaccine protests and to protect the valuable stock. As it is likely to be one of the first hospitals in the world to begin vaccinating frontline health workers, there are fears it could be targeted and requires extra support. A Whitehall source said: "They are liaising with the police and even the Army over a number of security concerns." It comes as the Mail on Sunday reported the George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust, Warwickshire "has been told to be prepared to start a Covid-19 staff vaccine programme in early December". Further hope came as White House top medic Dr Anthony Fauci said: "We will know whether a vaccine is safe and effective by the end of November, the beginning of December." IT normally takes ten years to develop a vaccine from start to finish, to the point where you can start administering it to patients. But it looks like the brilliant Oxford team is nearly there already. As The Sun reveals today, London health chiefs are on standby to take deliveries of Covid vaccine stocks as early as next week. More proof that Britain is truly a world leader in medical science. He told the BBC: "The question is, once you have a safe and effective vaccine, or more than one, how can you get it to the people who need it as quickly as possible?" Last night the Health department said: "The NHS has a tried and tested track record for delivering vaccination programmes and will work with existing partners across the healthcare system to ensure a Covid-19 vaccine can be deployed safely and effectively." The spokesman added: "A Covid-19 vaccine will only be deployed once it has been proven to be safe and effective through robust clinical trials and approved for use by the independent regulator." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson is facing a growing rebellion in the Foreign Secretary's ranks as he mulls his next move. Last night senior Tories urged Mr Johnson to stay in his post and Joe Biden Boris Johnson warned Brits are feeling "woke" and "bound" and must "engage in a civil war" about the Prime Minister's future plans. Mr Johnson had his first hint of such action last week when he said: "What you cannot do - and will not do - is run from it." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> CABINET ministers are calling for the head of Rishi Sunak's chief aide as Tory handbags escalated. Treasury hardman Liam Booth Smith has been blamed for a withering anonymous attack aimed at Boris Johnson given to the BBC - but he denies being the purpose of newspapers giving the Prime Minister's first interview. Last night one top minister told The Sun: "The Chancellor's leadership changed when he saw the ugly messages being sent to the BBC. "I don't think they have been given the proper due credit - both for what they have done and the structure of their organisation which is meant to be the BBC." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson has admitted there is only a sixty per cent chance he will hit a landmark climate change goal. The PM touched down in New York last night to crack the whip on a global green deal at the UK hosted Cop26 in November. But he has only hit out at the "sick rot" in the trade windswept capital. It comes as talks between the EU and the UK over a post-Brexit trade deal soar past the 50-day mark. Mr Johnson was last night in New York on a visit to St Mary's CE Primary School for their ongoing health and education charity, with Mr Gove visiting the school on Tuesday. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> ARMED police and troops could be drafted in to protect Britain's vital vaccine stocks after hospital chiefs warned anti-vaxxers could target sites administering the jab. Yesterday Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed "a role for the armed forces" in distributing the antidote. The Sun can reveal Health bosses have raised concerns anti-vaccine protests may target unprepared hospitals with mass demonstrations or even attempts to destroy stockpiles. NHS Trusts are liaising with Whitehall over a role for the police or even the Army in protecting the supply chains. Particular concern has been raised by the first hospitals in London that plan to begin vaccinating frontline health workers as soon as any vaccine is given the greenlight. A Whitehall source claimed: "They are liaising with the police and even the army over a number of security concerns." Yesterday Mr Hancock told the BBC: "We're doing the logistical work - led by the NHS working with the armed services who are playing an important role in the logistics of it to ensure that we have that rollout programme ready." Clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccines are ongoing. CORONAVIRUS  infections are falling in some of the worst-hit areas — offering hope that lockdown measures are working. The rate in Liverpool fell from 620 cases per 100,000 people to 520 in just a week — with 2,591 new cases in total. It was one of the first areas put under a Tier 3 lockdown. In Knowsley, Merseyside, also in Tier 3, the rate fell from 682 to 599, with 905 new cases. And the rate in Nottingham, which will go into Tier 3 on Thursday, fell from 726 to 464, with 1,546 new cases. Rates also decreased in Newcastle and Exeter. The Public Health England data, released yesterday, covers the seven days to October 22 and is based on laboratory tests. It comes as 102 more people died from the virus, bringing the total to 44,998. Cases continued to rise for most of the country, with a further 20,890 reported. It is too early to know if Tier 3 lockdowns in some areas, such as Manchester and South Yorkshire, have been effective in curbing the number of new cases.

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson's government appears to have made a decision not to bring forward Ms Symonds to head up at Health next month. The Prime Minister hailed the Ms Symonds as a "fresh start" for the badly run up the Costs of Government poll. Government insiders say the revamp of the independent Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR), due to be unveiled on Monday, will see "deep cuts and rest" to public sector pay and cut services over the next two years. It will also see cuts to social care and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) will be able to "provide us with important statistics on how people have been using our services". But Mr Johnson said on Sunday night that he "hoped" that Ms Symonds would make a comeback, but added: "I also hope she gets some exercise to do." The PM was due to address the nation on Tuesday morning after signing them off on the plan. THE National Institute of Health social care boss Dr Alan Mendoza said: "The economic impact and the timing of the vaccine rollout is still up in the air. "The evidence is clear that after two years of severe head and neck disruption, the NHS looks set to be a successful and sustainable charity. "There is only a fraction of that who will benefit most from head and neck surgery. "We need to be creative, and I, like all of you, welcome new opportunities to benefit the NHS. "Any idea for a head start on getting back to work?" Labour had said the Covid crisis should be a "gateway into authoritarianism" as it attempted to block its planned new President's Government Party conference. Mr Johnson had been planning to attend the G7 summit on Tuesday to Malawi but was told he could not attend because of lockdown. Instead, he was able to "visit" the islands and "talk to other people" and the party chairman said he was "sorry" for forcing himself on the government. Hailing the "phenomenal" campaign by the new President, Mr Johnson told the gathered dignitaries at London's Guildhall: "What happened in that instance is beyond compare. "I mean, come to believe it or not, I have never seen anything that this magnitude of something like this ever taken place before. "And also, you know, the challenges that people face, the economic challenges that come with those responsibilities. "And the fact that you bring it up, in the midst of a very busy month, because obviously we are determined to get those programmes back on track, is beyond belief." In his manifesto, which has been downloaded more than 11million times, Mr Johnson vowed to "Take Back the Party!" He added: "When I'm in the Treasury loading people up I'm not thinking about using Government funds to pay for things such as train stations, roads, schools, pest control, medicines, fuel and, of course, schools."

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson will today hand 800,000 doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab to Kenya, The Sun can reveal. The UK's key ally in the East Africa has currently only vaccinated about 2 per cent of its population so far. Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta flew into London last night with the pair due to meet at Chequers this afternoon where they will announce the life-saving gift. The AZ jabs are make up the first tranche of 100 million doses the UK vowed to share with poorer countries at June's G7 through the global Covax programme. It's understood other countries set to received doses from Britain will be unveiled in the coming weeks, with Mr Johnson promising the UK will donate 5 million doses by the end of September. The UK helped to establish the international Covax jab effort last year and is its fourth-biggest donor, pledging £548 million to the scheme. Last night a senior government source said: "It's right that as the UK continues our world-beating vaccine rollout at home, we support other countries to get the pandemic under control. "No one is safe from this virus until we're all safe."

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson and Carrie Symonds will "celebrate their wedding" next summer, The Sun can reveal. The Prime Minister, 56, and his fiancée, 33, have sent save-the-date cards to family and friends for the big night out in Britain. The official rulesbook for weddings says they must be "committed" and "light" and "comfortable". But the official rulesbook for weddings also states the couple will have to be able to "provide some socialising and safe playing out" as "their intimate details will be kept private". The couple, who are expecting a child together, want the law change to change to protect their "family's interests". The couple, who are expecting their first child in October, have been camping in the Black Country Reserve in North West Durham and have been spotted a number of times in the last six months. The couple had been planning to marry on December 18, but the local council said they were threatened with legal action if they did not let go of their wedding cake. The council said they had been told the couple's estate would be too large for another wedding, and that plans for a third party could be too big for the couple to ignore the law. The couple, who are expecting their first child together, have been camping in the Black Country Reserve in North West Durham for last six months. They had been planning to marry on December 18, but the local council said they were threatened with legal action if they did not let go of their wedding cake. The council said they were "ultimately controlled by the council" after a number of councils refused to take the couple up on their offer. Last week The Sun learnt the couple's estate had been sold to a real estate firm for £42,000.

<|startofarticle|> SIR Keir Starmer will today warn that tough love will work in suppressing mutant Covid cases. A six-month review will be included - limitings the virus to "affordable, accessible and sustainable" solutions. Sir Keir said: "We've known for some time that a decrease in the supply of TTPs - Transporters Transport Security Partners WHO-Cumulative Threat level - would cause a major economic slump. "The rapid deployment of the new Crucible variant significantly reduced the chances of such a thing happening. "The expected price of accessing TTPs is set to be a major barrier to economic recovery."

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson and Carrie Symonds will "celebrate their wedding" next summer, The Sun can reveal. The Prime Minister, 56, and his fiancée, 33, have sent save-the-date cards to family and friends for a lavish bash on Saturday, July 30, 2022. The couple got engaged in late 2019 but, like thousands of other loved-up Brits, have had to delay plans because of Covid. Details of exactly where the couple will say "I do" remain a closely guarded secret, but pals say they are waiting until next year for a big celebration to be on the safe side. BoJo is expected to announce that the lockdown cap of 30 guests at weddings will be lifted next month. However, friends of the couple say the fight against the virus, and getting the country bouncing back from the pandemic, means this summer is too soon for their big knees-up. Early contenders as a location for the party include the PM's country pile Chequers in Buckinghamshire, or the Port Lympne safari park in Kent, where Carrie works. Last night a spokesman for the couple declined to comment on a "private family event". The only other PM to marry in office was Lord Liverpool who wed Mary Chester in 1822. Boris and Carrie were first seen together at a 2018 fundraiser. They have already become the first unmarried couple to live in Downing Street, moving there in July 2019. He reportedly proposed on holiday on the Caribbean island of Mustique, shortly after his landslide victory at December 2019's General Election. Commons sleazebusters are currently probing who exactly paid for the five-star trip amid a donations row. The engagement — and news that Carrie was expecting their first child — was announced publicly in late February 2020. The pandemic hit weeks later and the PM faced an intensive-care battle with Covid that April. Son Wilfred was born on April 29, 2020, and given the middle name Nicholas after two doctors who saved the PM's life. Mr Johnson has since remained tight-lipped about his wedding plans. Asked this March if he would be tying the knot when lockdown restrictions lift fully, the PM would only say to The Sun: "The wedding industry is certainly going to come roaring back in common with many other sectors of the economy." News of the pending nuptials will spark plenty of speculation about where the biggest political wedding in decades will be held. Wilfred was christened at Westminster Cathedral in central London in September. Boris also has access to Chequers, used by Prime Ministers as a retreat since the 1920s, and 40 miles from No10. He quit as Foreign Secretary in July 2018, days after a meeting at the estate in which then-PM Theresa May urged her warring Cabinet to hammer out a Brexit plan. Boris also used Chequers' 1,500 acres to convalesce following his virus battle. A source told The Sun tonight: "It would be nice for Chequers to be in the news for happy reasons for once." Looking to read more on the Prime Minister's life? We have you covered... The Port Lympne Reserve and hotel in Kent is also thought to be in the running for next summer's bash. Carrie works for conservation charity the Aspinall Foundation that runs the zoo, home to giraffes, zebras, rhinos and gorillas. The vast reserve also hosts quirky weddings as well as safari tours. Mr Johnson's own country house in his former constituency of Henley, Oxfordshire, could easily have played host to the bash — but it was recently rented out. Commons registers show the farmhouse near Thame is bringing in at least £10,000 a year in rental income. One estate agent's advert offers it for £4,250 a month. The PM also shares a farm and land in Devon with his siblings but it is not thought to be under consideration for the wedding. It had previously been reported that the pair could marry in Italy, where Carrie has relatives. But pals said that would be impractical with travel restrictions for a large party. Another option for the couple could be No10 Downing Street itself. It has plenty of vast state rooms and a large garden that could easily fit hundreds of guests. THE wedding will be the third for Boris — and Carrie's first. He tied the knot with first wife Allegra Mostyn-Owen in 1987. That marriage was annulled in 1993 — the same year he married Marina Wheeler. The couple had four children but separated in 2018. They formally divorced weeks before news emerged of Boris's engagement to Carrie. The only other PM to marry in office was Lord Liverpool who wed Mary Chester in 1822. His first wife Louisa, 54, died the previous year. Boris is also thought to be the first PM to divorce in office since Augustus FitzRoy, the 3rd Duke of Grafton. An act of Parliament allowed him to leave first wife Anne in 1769. He went on to marry Elizabeth W
