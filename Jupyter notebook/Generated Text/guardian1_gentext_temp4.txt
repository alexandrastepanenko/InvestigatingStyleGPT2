<|startofarticle|>  Boris Johnson has said "we truly did everything we could" to minimise loss of life from coronavirus, and insisted he takes "full responsibility" for the government's handling of the pandemic. Speaking in Glasgow, where he was making a brief visit to the Cop26 climate summit as it entered its final days, the prime minister sought to reassure the public after a slew of revelations about the private earnings of his party colleagues. "I genuinely believe that taking full responsibility for your own actions, whether as a prime minister or as a citizen, is the best way forward," he said.  He declined to comment directly on individual ministers, including the health secretary, Matt Hancock, who has been holding hostage the release of a suspected sex offender. But Johnson said: "I think what you've got is cases where, sadly, MPs have broken the rules in the past, may be guilty of breaking the rules today. What I want to see is them facing appropriate sanctions … The most important thing is, those who break the rules must be investigated and should be punished." He was speaking a week after whipping Conservative MPs to back an amendment that sought to avert punishment for Owen Paterson – an MP found to have broken the rules – by tearing up the parliamentary standards system. Johnson reversed that decision less than 24 hours later after a backlash from Conservative MPs, and has since tabled a motion unpicking the amendment, which MPs will vote on next week. Paterson has since resigned. Amid a flurry of claims about MPs' lucrative second jobs and whether they create conflicts of interest, Johnson said in many cases the public believed this outside work "has actually strengthened our democracy". He said for a hundred years MPs had also worked as "doctors or lawyers or soldiers or firefighters". But Johnson stressed that if such second jobs were to continue, "it is crucial that MPs follow the rules" by devoting themselves primarily to their constituents and avoiding "paid advocacy". "Anybody who breaks the rules, who engages in paid advocacy in the House of Commons, should be punished," he said. Parliament's standards committee found Paterson had committed an "egregious" breach of the rules by repeatedly lobbying the government on behalf of two companies paying him more than £100,000 a year. Cox released a statement defending his actions on Wednesday. "He does not believe that he breached the rules, but will of course accept the judgment of the parliamentary commissioner or of the committee on the matter," said the statement, worded entirely in the third person. His is only the latest of a string of cases brought to light in the past week after the prime minister's botched attempt to protect Paterson. The Guardian revealed on Tuesday that Iain Duncan Smith chaired a taskforce advising the government that made recommendations on how hand sanitiser should be regulated – while being paid £25,000 a year by a company that manufactures hand sanitiser.

<|startofarticle|>  Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, has said her own experience as a care worker helped to convince her more flexible working could be a "win-win" for staff and employers. Speaking to the Guardian after announcing new policies last week on employment rights and flexible conditions, Rayner said she had helped negotiate family-friendly working when she was a trade union representative.  "We were frontline manual workers, delivering 7am till 10pm care in people's homes. We introduced a flexible rota that worked for the staff, and we saw productivity go up. The wellbeing of the staff, as well as the outcome for the service user, was they had the same staff going in – and sickness levels went significantly down as well, so it saved money for the employer. It's a win-win," she said. "Of course, not everything can be achieved in every single workplace, but there are flexible options I believe in every workplace. If an employer looks after the employees, the employees will look after the employer, and it's reciprocal," she added. Rayner announced this week that a Labour government would legislate to give companies an obligation to provide flexible conditions – including compressed hours, and accommodating caring responsibilities such as the school run – unless they can show it is unworkable. It was part of a package of measures, drawn up with the shadow workers' rights minister, Andy McDonald, that also included ensuring all employees gain rights from day one in a job. The plans have been welcomed by the Corbynite campaign group Momentum, and helped to assuage fears among some in the party that Starmer would ditch the radical 2019 manifesto wholesale. Speaking after a visit to a flexible working hub in Hull, Rayner said Labour's aim was nothing less than to achieve a "cultural shift" in the workplace. "It's about changing the culture in our country. The whole emphasis to me is, yes there's individual nuggets in here, but it's about a cultural shift away from people being inflexible, and not looking for new and fresh ideas about how people can engage in the workplace," she said. Rayner shrugged off suggestions that she has been at loggerheads with Keir Starmer – or could even challenge him for the leadership, as some supporters had urged her to do before the Batley and Spen byelection earlier this month. "Me and Keir have been working incredibly closely together since the start of the pandemic," she said, comparing the day when they were both elected in the depths of the first lockdown to "an arranged marriage, almost, by telephone". "We bring different things to that leadership. And I think that works," she said, calling them "yin and yang". Labour's loss of the Hartlepool constituency in May sparked panic about Starmer's prospects of leading Labour to a general election victory, with some MPs quietly casting around for a candidate who could gather the 40 signatures necessary to mount a challenge. But his leadership has appeared more secure since the party held the Yorkshire seat of Batley and Spen. Rayner said she and Starmer had different approaches. "You know, my style is more robust as people know: I'm more bombastic, in the way in which do things, I say it how I see it: and therefore I bring that freshness to the partnership." "Keir's very forensic, he's very intelligent. He's very passionate about making sure that the country is a better place," she said. Rayner has spoken in the past about growing up in poverty, and becoming a carer for her mother, who struggled with mental illness, from the age of 10. "I like to think I overshare and Keir undershares," she said. "If you look at Keir's background, it's not dissimilar for mine: he looked after his mum, I looked after my mum," she says. "Keir wasn't from a privileged background". Challenged about a dip in Labour's membership, Rayner said she was focused on voters. "Of course we want to attract people to be members of the Labour party, but what we need to do is we need to attract voters as well. And what we're doing is we're speaking to the country: we're saying that actually we don't want to be an opposition, we want to be a government," she said. Labour is in the process of laying off up to 90 staff via voluntary redundancies, as Starmer seeks to repair the party's shattered finances after costly election battles and a string of legal cases. The former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott criticised Labour this week for simultaneously seeking to hire staff on six-month contracts to handle a backlog of complaints against members. "So Keir will make Britain the best place to work – unless you work for Labour," Abbott tweeted. Rayner rejected that, highlighting the importance of ensuring the party is financially viable. "We don't want to be making staff redundant. It's an awful situation but
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour's performance on Thursday was widely seen as a potential suicide point for the party's autumn conference plans, with many MPs tuning in to tune in to witness the party's biggest ever day. However, there has been criticism from within his own party about what many MPs perceive as drift and indecision in Downing Street – and a lack of concrete policies. Speculation was rife at Westminster this week that Starmer could take aim directly at Johnson, something he has repeatedly done, whipping his party into a political alliance to the tune of £100bn in 2020-21. The chancellor – seen as the favourite to win by smashing the top four lists – is widely seen as a potential successor to Boris Johnson.  But it is unclear whether that will be enough to convince the sceptical Tory base. While the Lib Dems overturned their lead over the Tories in the "stay at home, leave the bastards behind" faction of voters, a significant amount of the party's senior players remain in place, including the hulking chief whip Nick Brown. Nevertheless, his deputy, Angela Rayner – a former union rep – is making a return to the fold as shadow secretary of state for the future of work. She will her role as shadow secretary of state for the future of work will be one of the few appointments made public, as the reshuffle rolls into its second day. Rayner, who was a shadow minister, was briefly shadow work and pensions secretary during the early days of the pandemic. She has since made several headline-grabbing policy announcements, including backing a legal right for employees to be allowed to switch off from work emails during Christmas. She is unlikely to want to cede that territory to Starmer, though the Labour leader is in a stronger position after the Batley result. Some MPs suggested Rayner's outriders had overreached themselves – and embarrassed her by inviting the private secretary, Allegra Stratton, as a guest of honour. But Starmer's authority has recovered sufficiently to put questions about his competence within the party on the agenda at Thursday, as Stratton and the Labour leader are still unable to agree what action to take. As well as taking on the Tories, the Ashworth result will also be a moment to remember for those who were lost in the wake of the pandemic, a moment for which Angela Rayner will be able to offer a coherent and effective message. She will be able to offer a political earthquake instead of a predictable pattern of poor policy development, which has led to a vicious circle of mismanagement and scandal. And the government will be much more confident that it has got its act together after the embarrassing winter of 2017 than it has after the Covid pandemic of 2017. Even before the scramble to get things under control, the government's domestic and border policies were faltering, and its approach to tackling the pandemic was ambiguous. The policy for reopening was often referred to as the "big six" by MPs, with some government sources claiming the reopening of the economy would be the first priority. The official version of events was that Robert Jenrick had simply moved the big six into a smaller number; that he was trying to "tune" the underlying policies of the day, without having to overhaul much of the complex social security and benefits system.  But this week's events have given ministers more questions about the long-term prospects for the country than they had anticipated. The reopening of the social security system had been underlined by the unexpectedly successful reopening of the mortgage market in May, with the support extended to millions of households. But Whitehall officials hadroses, such as the fact that people could now receive a mortgage in the autumn and winter, and many did, were the result of a lengthy review carried out by the independent credit review body Sure Start centres. And, as was the case last week, the government's wholesale reopening plan has the support of the major credit unions including National, Campbell and Brown, although they could be reluctant to support it in the run-up to Christmas. Whitehall sources insisted the chancellor was not yet convinced that the social security reopening was a matter of "goals". "He's very clear on this: 'We need to make sure that we get the programme going in the right way,' that means we have to go beyond simply reopening the economy. We need to bring it working. And the prime minister has a very clear line in relation to what that means in the post-Christmas world,'" they said. The furlough scheme is being overseen by Michael Gove, who was a remainer under Theresa May. He has been closely involved in the design and implementation of the social security reopening policy, which was legislated for under George Osborne. He was given a go-ahead from Theresa May's cabinet for Christmas in 2019. The Welsh secretary, Steve Brine, has said he will publish a breakdown of individual departmental decisions regarding when that can be done.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Keir Starmer has appointed well-respected north-east of England MP Sharon Hodgson as his new parliamentary aide, as he seeks to smooth relations with Labour backbenchers after last weekend's fraught reshuffle. Hodgson, the MP for Washington and Sunderland West since 2010, replaces Carolyn Harris, who resigned earlier this week amid claims that she had stoked up tensions between Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner.  As Starmer's parliamentary private secretary, her job will be to liaise between backbenchers and the leader's office. Some MPs have complained in recent weeks that they felt neglected by Starmer's team. Hodgson will also bring understanding of the north-east, where Labour lost the Hartlepool byelection last week, and the Conservatives made fresh inroads in local council elections. Labour announced several other junior appointments on Friday evening, as the Labour leader completed the shakeup that began in the wake of last week's election results. Peter Kyle, the Hove MP, will be the shadow schools minister, after Wes Streeting was handed a new role overseeing Labour's child poverty strategy. Streeting announced on Friday that he will step back from frontline politics for the time being after being diagnosed with kidney cancer. The leftwinger Andy McDonald will have a beefed-up role in Rayner's new team, as shadow secretary of state for employment rights and protections. Seema Malhotra will be shadow business and consumer minister, replacing Lucy Powell, who was promoted last week to be shadow housing secretary. Other changes include a return to the fold for several MPs who had resigned for various reasons. Flo Eshalomi, MP for Vauxhall, who resigned rather than vote for Boris Johnson's Brexit in December, returns as Rayner's new parliamentary private secretary. Olivia Blake, the MP for Sheffield Hallam, who stepped down over Labour's stance on the overseas operations bill, returns as shadow minister for nature. Starmer's plans for overhauling his frontbench last weekend were held up for much of last Sunday by negotiations with Rayner about what role she would be willing to accept. She relinquished the jobs of party chair and national campaign coordinator, and was instead handed the role of shadowing the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, as well as other titles, including shadow secretary of state for the future of work.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  The government is investigating the use of "Covid status certificates" to help allow society to reopen, Boris Johnson has announced, as he set out a cautious, four-step unlocking plan for England that will see some sectors remain shuttered until June. "The end really is in sight; and a wretched year will give way to a spring and a summer that will be very different and incomparably better than the picture we see around us today," the prime minister told MPs on Monday as he announced the unlocking plan.  Ministers have repeatedly denied that they would consider the domestic use of so-called vaccine passports, fearing they pose risks of discrimination, as some groups are unable to receive the coronavirus jab. But as part of the government's roadmap out of England's national lockdown, a review will be carried out to assess whether certificates could allow restrictions to be lifted more safely. It is expected to report before June. In a nod to potential objections, Johnson said the review would be, "mindful of the many concerns surrounding exclusion, discrimination and privacy". The keenly awaited roadmap, which the government insists will be dependent on "data, not dates", lays out a four-step reopening process that will see the "stay at home" order remain in place for a further five weeks. With the prime minister keen to avoid having to order a fresh lockdown, he has opted for a gradual lifting of restrictions across England, which is likely to irk some Conservative MPs, who will be given a vote on the plan next month. Schools will reopen to all pupils on 8 March. The only other change at that point will be that two people from different households will be able to meet outside socially, instead of just for exercise. From 29 March, in the second part of step one, the "stay at home" order will lift so people can meet family members in a park or garden, and outdoor sports facilities will be allowed to reopen. In step two, from 12 April, hairdressers and non-essential shops will be allowed to reopen, as well as self-catering accommodation, public buildings such as libraries and museums, and outdoor hospitality such as pub gardens. From 17 May, in step three, most rules on outdoor social contact will be lifted, aside from a limit of 30 on the size of gatherings. Pubs and restaurants will be able to serve customers indoors. In step four, from 21 June, all limits on socialising should be lifted and the government hopes that businesses that were unable to reopen in summer 2020, such as nightclubs, will be able to reopen their doors. The five-week gap between the phases is intended to allow four weeks for data to emerge about the impact of the changes on the disease and a week's notice for the next stage of easing to be introduced. "The chief medical officer is clear that moving any faster would mean acting before we know the impact of each step, which would increase the risk of us having to reverse course and reimpose restrictions. I won't take that risk," the prime minister told the House of Commons. Johnson told MPs: "We're setting out on what I hope and believe is a one-way journey to freedom." He said there was "no credible route" to a zero-Covid Britain - or a zero-Covid world - and argued: "We cannot persist indefinitely with restrictions that debilitate our economy, our physical and mental wellbeing, and the life chances of our children." The factors the government will consider in weighing whether to proceed with the planned dates are: the progress of the vaccination programme; news on new variants of the disease; the shift in hospitalisations and deaths; and whether the number of new infections risks overwhelming the NHS. There was no firm news for families hoping to have a summer break abroad. The government said the ban on international travel would continue until at least 17 May. Meanwhile, ministers will carry out a review into how travel – both inbound and outbound – could safely resume, and what measures should be put in place to facilitate it. Another review will be carried out into mask-wearing, social distancing and working from home, all of which are expected to continue for the time being. That review is expected to be completed before step 4 is implemented in June. Unlike last autumn, when different tiered restrictions were imposed at local level, the changes will be England-wide – though small-scale local lockdowns could be imposed if worrying evidence of new variants emerges. Johnson sought to reassure businesses about the financial impact of the gradual reopening plan, promising "we will not pull the rug out" – but left the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to set out the details in next week's budget. Over time, scientists expect Covid-19 to become endemic, meaning the virus will reach a stable, hopefully manageable level. Vaccinations – including revaccinations – will be key to managing the transition from pandemic to endemic state. Therapeutics and antivirals will

<|startofarticle|>  Keir Starmer has appointed well-respected north-east of England MP Sharon Hodgson as his new parliamentary aide, as he seeks to smooth relations with Labour backbenchers after last weekend's fraught reshuffle. Hodgson, the MP for Washington and Sunderland West since 2010, replaces Carolyn Harris, who resigned earlier this week amid claims that she had stoked up tensions between Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner.  As Starmer's parliamentary private secretary, her job will be to liaise between backbenchers and the leader's office. Some MPs have complained in recent weeks that they felt neglected by Starmer's team. Hodgson will also bring understanding of the north-east, where Labour lost the Hartlepool byelection last week, and the Midlands are said to be concerned about whether they can continue to be the party of law and order. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is expected to extend the £20-a-week uplift he announced last week, with the economy growing by 1.5% this month. The levelling-up white paper is regarded as a potential reset moment for the Labour party. But it is unclear whether the new Whitehall-style approach will be enough to convince Starmer's MPs of the point he made on Saturday. The party is embroiled in costly legal action against five senior members of the staff of former shadow cabinet adviser Dominic Cummings about breaching parliament's code of conduct, which means "inappropriate" or "unfair".  Starmer's team say they learn from the Johnson years, but the focus on ethics in public life is now the cornerstone of his leadership. He said in a statement they "welcomed the appointment of Carolyn Harris, a respected and distinguished civil servant, to her position as party chair and political director of the party's forthcoming campaign committee". Harris, who was a shadow Cabinet Office minister, was recently suspended from cabinet for sayingings to colleagues about the government's affairs. The comments were made when Johnson was visiting the UK as a trade mission, and were investigated by the independent watchdog, into whether he said the flippancy language was "inappropriate." Labour party chair Anneliese Dodds said: "This is a clear signal of the cuts to public services the Tories have made to our public services, and which mean nothing if we are going to cut services. "Not to be outflanked by the Conservatives is because of their record – this is a government that has undermined our public services by choice, and has poured taxpayers' money into projects that are simply not serving the people who they are." Cummings waded into the row on Twitter on Monday, recalling his comparison of the NHS with a "wimp", after the former health secretary said the NHS was "producing a generation of extremely poor, insecure, and ill-equipped people". He suggested that the public were "proud of the fact that we have got better". The prime minister's official spokesman has insisted the UK was "not remotely a corrupt country". But some of the political and legal experts who have studied the case have become increasingly concerned about the risks of corruption in the system, and the lack of strongman rule-breaking. As well as Cummings, the barrister Neil Irwin has been examining the fate of the British Virgin Islands, a key donor that allows citizens the opportunity to board a free ferry. Irwin, who is Jewish, is deeply concerned about the risks of over-saturation in the virus, and the lack of a firm date for the next stage of testing, which is expected to take several months. The prime minister was last seen on Saturday, as he set out plans for a "big bang" reopening on Monday. He was greeted by a mop-headed counterpart on Whitehall radio on Wednesday, by the health secretary, Sajid Javid, who insisted "nothing has changed". Johnson was keen to emphasise that he was not, after all, a health and social care executive, having previously held the health secretary post. Rather, he was a leading lightsman who has a Tony Blair-like ability. Johnson's colourful private life also served as a shield from the spotlight he expected to receive as a mark of respect for his probity. He was born in Luton and went to school in nearby Upton, where he majored in philosophy. He has been widely seen on-record as saying he would rather spend time with his family in Bristol, where he is known to have a "mop". Johnson's biographer, Andrew Gimson, told Politico's Playbook on Friday that as he celebrates his 100th birthday this weekend, "he'll be very, very sad because he's a health and social care executive. He was very well liked by his mother and was encouraged by his siblings. He has a very sad story to tell." The Playbook contributor is the author of a blog, Care of Ourselves: The Curious Case Of A Caretaker, as well as a Glenn Greenwald-style best-seller, The Great

<|startofarticle|>  Jeremy Corbyn has pledged to campaign against the arrival of Rupert Murdoch's News UK television channel as he launched his Peace and Justice Project at an online rally. A more "just, free and accountable" media is one of four causes Corbyn is encouraging his supporters to back. He also urged them to help with organising direct support in communities, such as food banks; campaign for a green new deal; and press the government to speed up the delivery of Covid vaccines in developing countries.  "So many of the ideas we need to make the 2020s better than the 2010s were developed in and around the Labour party in recent years, by outstanding thinkers, but more importantly by demands of our movements, and the skills, knowledge and needs of the communities affected," Corbyn said. "We will build on these policies, taking them further, adapting them to the post-pandemic world, so that our movement can turn the dial towards peace and justice." Corbyn was readmitted to the Labour party in November, after being suspended over remarks he made when the Equality and Human Rights Commission published its critical report on the party's handling of antisemitism. But his successor as leader, Keir Starmer, declined to restore the Labour whip to Corbyn, who now sits as an independent MP. The broadcasting regulator, Ofcom, gave the go-ahead last month to Murdoch's right-leaning news channel, which is expected to be on air for four to five hours a night. It is expected to compete with Andrew Neil's GB News, with the pair racing to be the first on air. Corbyn repeatedly criticised the role of the media in public life during his time as leader of the opposition. He was ridiculed in some of Murdoch's newspapers, with the Sun's front page on election day in 2017 urging its readers: "Don't chuck Britain in the Cor-bin." Corbyn gave a lecture at the Edinburgh television festival in 2018 calling for a taxpayer-owned British Digital Corporation to offset the power of multinational corporations in the media, though the policy never found its way into Labour's manifesto. His digital rally also featured Greece's former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis and the Labour MP for Coventry South, Zarah Sultana. The new initiative will not be signing up members but Corbyn hopes to play a convening role in bringing together activists, trade unions and other leftwing groups. Setting out the aims of his new political venture, he appeared to take a sideswipe at his successor, saying: "If you refuse to argue for your side, our opponents win by default." Some of Corbyn's allies believe Starmer has not been sufficiently robust in attacking Boris Johnson's government – and fear backsliding from some of the radical policies set out in the 2019 general election manifesto. Starmer has adopted the slogan "a new leadership" to differentiate his tenure from Corbyn's four-and-a-half-year period at the top of the party.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Keir Starmer is committed to debating plans for a green new deal at Labour's conference later this month, his team have insisted, despite the party having rejected a grassroots motion on the issue. The justice secretary, David Lammy, and the former work and pensions secretary David Willetts called a conference on green new deal on Tuesday, despite the government's controversial "framework agreement". The new deal must first be approved by the NEC, which decides how much time is allowed for an application to go ahead. Willetts had suggested an increase in the fuel duty due to material shortages in the energy sector, but Starmer said he wanted to see "a free trade agreement with Australia, which can make the UK the template for a successful outcome to the G7 summit". When the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, objected to the UK's free trade agreement with the US, the UK stuck by the agreement, insisting it was time to "go global".  But Starmer's team appeared to be blindsided by the foreign secretary's comments on Wednesday. Johnson had previously insisted he was in talks with Starmer about the details of the agreement with Australia.  After a phone conversation between the two men, the prime minister said: "I think we can agree that the Iranians can come and participate in this, but the Iranians must be excluded from the criteria." He added: "We are going to be looking closely at the form of international participation that is in line with the agenda of the Labour party." Morrison's comments came as Starmer said he was keen to have a bilateral agreement with the UK on commercial space travel, joking: "What if the prime minister were to say that we develop technologies that could be developed in India? What if he said that we develop technologies that could be developed in India?" Johnson's official spokesperson has insisted the prime minister was not suggesting a bilateral agreement between the UK and the US, instead setting out a bolder initiative aimed at tying the two together over the next five years. Morrison has suggested the UK make a commitment to the US that it will not build more of its A-10 supertankers in Afghanistan, a request that backbench Conservatives oppose. The US and UK have worked closely on the project, which has involved the development of a variant that is more accurate at striking a striking pose with its barrel. Johnson's comments came as Biden said on Sunday that the US would take no part in the next-best deal, despite the importance of the pact taking down the Taliban regime. The prime minister was asked about Biden's stance during a phone in on LBC radio, in which he was challenged by a caller about an article he wrote in 1995 in which he praised the Americans for their "heroic" efforts in the early days of the pandemic. Johnson: "America, Canada, and Australia are here to stay."
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Boris Johnson has said "we truly did everything we could" to minimise loss of life from coronavirus, and insisted he takes "full responsibility" for the government's handling of the pandemic. Speaking to journalists en route to an announcement at the Edinburgh press tour, the prime minister said he and Biden had been "quietly clear" about the severity of the virus' pandemic plans.  "We expressed our caution – and we sincerely apologise for the distress caused – about the very serious situation we are in today. We have taken full responsibility for the outcome of the first wave of the pandemic. The second wave is now almost over," he said, adding: "We must be as cautious as we can. The right thing is for us to be having babies. To have babies is to be having a serious, pandemic-free life." Asked what that meant, he said: "We're working very closely with partners and other partners, working closely with the NICU, to try to get all these things under control." The prime minister was speaking at a Downing Street press conference alongside the health secretary, Sajid Javid, and the chief executive of NHS England, Amanda Pritchard. Shortly before the briefing began, the UK Health Security Agency announced that a further eight cases of the Omicron variant had been discovered in England, bringing the UK total to 22. The prime minister urged the public not to be gloomy about news of the emergence of the new variant, insisting the country was in a much better position with vaccines available. "Right now, our best single defence against Omicron is to get vaccinated and to get boosted," the prime minister said. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommended on Monday that all over-18s be offered a third jab, and the gap between the second and third doses be halved to three months. Javid said: "We're now able to put our booster programme on steroids, and protect even more people, even more quickly … If we want to give ourselves the chance of a Christmas with our loved ones, the best thing we can do is step up, roll up our sleeves, and get protected when the time comes." Pritchard said for the time being only those already eligible for a booster, which includes over-40s whose second jab was six months ago, would be able to book an appointment, and it would later be opened more widely. She urged people to wait until they are contacted by the NHS before trying to book. Pritchard said the NHS now has almost 3,000 vaccination sites available across the UK. But she stressed that while the NHS was confident it could meet the end-January target for offering all adults a booster, she warned "it can't happen overnight", pointing to the pressures on health service staff.

<|startofarticle|>  The TUC's general secretary, Frances O'Grady, has accused ministers of "washing their hands" of employees' safety, after unions and business groups were told they would not be consulted on guidance set to come into force on 19 July in England. O'Grady, who represents 5.5 million workers, has written to the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, to express the TUC's concerns.  "We have real fears that clear, detailed guidance for employers will be replaced by vague exhortations to do the right thing, resulting in confusion," she said. "We believe this amounts to the government washing its hands of its responsibility to ensure workplace safety." As businesses prepared to reopen after last year's lockdown, the then business secretary, Alok Sharma, carried out detailed discussions with representatives of employers and unions, about how best to make workplaces Covid-secure. Hundreds of pages of sector-specific guidance were then published, including everything from mask wearing to safety screens, hand sanitiser to staff rotas. With less than a fortnight to go before 19 July, the Guardian understands business groups and unions have been told by officials at Kwarteng's department that they will not be consulted on what will replace the present Covid-secure rules. Some believe the government now hopes to shift responsibility back on to individual employers as much as possible, in line with the wider ethos of "freedom day". Boris Johnson has described 19 July as an inflexion point, when the "diktat" of government regulations will be replaced by personal responsibility. The government has already made clear that the 1m distancing rule will be scrapped, mask wearing will no longer be mandatory in public places, and the guidance that office workers should work from home where possible will no longer apply. But it is unclear how much of the wider Covid-secure guidance will be withdrawn, and what the government plans to replace it with. Downing Street has suggested, for example, that it hopes a culture of wearing masks in some situations out of politeness will replace legal penalties. O'Grady warned: "We all want working life to get back to business as usual. But as restrictions are lifted and increasing numbers return to their workplaces, it is crucial that we get workplace safety right, and give workers and members of the public confidence. "This is how we get the country up and running again – not hobbled by rising infections and enforced self-isolation taking workers out of workplaces," she added. She pointed out that many workers still only have the protection of one dose of the vaccine, including many pregnant women, and some workers will have compromised immune systems. The Unite assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail said: "Our members have been on the frontline for the last 16 months literally risking their lives and the health of their families, while keeping the UK operating. "To not even consult their representatives in order to better understand workers' worries and concerns is not only arrogant but further undermines the public's confidence in the government's strategy." Workplace guidance is just one aspect of how the world will look after 19 July that remains unclear: business groups are also pressing the government to commit to continuing to fund regular workplace testing for Covid. The CBI's director of policy, John Foster, welcomed hints from the chancellor on Thursday that the government will look again at the operation of the test and trace app, to try to reduce unnecessary self-isolation – something businesses have been calling for. But he added: "There are other areas where clarity from government can help to boost confidence, for example, knowing whether workplace testing will continue beyond July. "Responsible employers can play their part too, by having good, collaborative conversations with their employees and informing customers how they are reopening safely." Health campaigners have also urged the government to publish new guidance for clinically vulnerable people about how they should protect themselves as cases surge in the coming weeks. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: "As set out in the latest guidance in our roadmap out of lockdown, our policy for Step 4 has been carefully developed in line with the findings of the roadmap reviews into social distancing, certification and the events research programme. "These reviews have been conducted in consultation with representatives from a variety of sectors. "Working safely guidance will be updated to reflect the policy announced on Monday 5 July, to ensure businesses are able to open safely, reducing the risk of transmission and protecting staff and customers."

<|startofarticle|>  Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, has said her own experience as a care worker helped to convince her "about the worthiness of the position we were taking". Speaking to the Guardian in Brighton where she will address Labour's annual conference on Tuesday, Rayner said she was inspired by her colleagues' courage in taking the stand in defence of the health service.  "We were all inspired by the courage of the millions of care workers who had put their lives on the line for our loved ones, risking their own health over the Covid pandemic. Some amazing peoplemaking. And when we got the helpline, we knew it was going to be very difficult for us not to." "We were inspired by the courage of the staff who had put their lives on the line for our loved ones. Hundreds of us took the next step and made the next sacrifice," she said. Rayner said she was proud of her performance and called on the public to "pay a little more respect" to the staff who have reached out to her. "If this has given you any indication of how wrongheaded the pandemic has been, then we have got to go on like this. We know this thing is spreading rapidly, and we know it is difficult for us nurses to be of service. We know this thing is spreading with such speed," she said. Rayner has spoken in the past about growing up in poverty, and becoming a carer for her mother, who struggled with mental illness, from the age of 10. "I like to think I overshare and lost my place in the world because I couldn't connect with people," she said. "I like to think I was through worse than that," she added. "I hate the idea of ever having to tell people I love them, or to expect them to love me for who I am." She said her mother had struggled with a mental illness for the past 18 months, and had been "horrified and horrified" by the issue. "She was very supportive of the prime minister's decision to put this huge initiative on the NHS and to use it to drive down important protections. She was also very supportive of the prime minister's call for nurseries to be allowed to accept customers who had been ordered to remove a part of the body. "She looked after her mum, very carefully," said one senior Tory. "She's got a very good sense of humour." However, they added: "She doesn't think her approach will be dissimilar for many of the smaller charities she has been working with over the past year or so. "She is very disillusioned with the current political climate and very frustrated with the lack of progress we're making at fredential." They said she had spoken to the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, and the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Bridget Phillipson, about the impact of the proposals. "It's like they said 'it will be easy to amend the statute at the back of the [tax] book to make it easier to read'," said one. One shadow cabinet member said the proposals had not been drawn up by themselves but by their affiliates. "There is zero understanding for them of the many intricacies of how the pandemic works and how it is interpreted by the public," they said. "They are playing on two very different levels." The first being that "the pandemic is a collection of individuals, one big collection – and that means we as a society, as a society, need to be more cautious with the uptake of new infections." That approach was rejected by the Dilnot review as "unfair for the wrong reasons". Later, when the prime minister was asked about the impact of the changes on businesses in a phone in on Sky News, he said: "We are adapting quickly, and we are adapting more quickly than we had anticipated. We are adapting more quickly than we had the chance to prepare for the change in the way the pandemic was transmitted." His words stuck in the air when the prime minister was asked about the impact of the changes on businesses in a visit to a manufacturing plant in Hull.  "I think what people want to hear is what plans we have," he said. "We are making strides in every area." The government has announced that £550m of the £11.6bn it had set aside for climate finance over the next five years will be allocated to developing countries, as part of the UK's contribution to the $100bn target. The UK has been a leading advocate for a more robust global response to the disruption of the Covid pandemic. But his official spokesperson has insisted the government is not considering adding more countries to the red list, a position set by the previous government. When the UN general assembly met from Dec 5, thetopic was on adding countries to the red list but Johnson said he did not intend to "toughen up" the system.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Boris Johnson has said "we truly did everything we could" to minimise loss of life from coronavirus, and insisted he takes "full responsibility" for the government's handling of the pandemic. But when an inquiry is eventually carried out into the past 12 torrid months, the prime minister will have to face a series of difficult questions about key decisions he made.  As news first began to trickle out of China, triggering the government's pandemic planning, the prime minister left the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to chair the first five meetings of the emergency Cobra committee about the virus. After carrying out a fraught reshuffle of his cabinet, Johnson decamped to the taxpayer-owned mansion of Chevening, and did not chair his first Covid Cobra meeting until 2 March, just before the first confirmed UK death from the virus. Comforted by advisers who compared the challenge to tackling seasonal flu, he tended to play down the seriousness of the pandemic in its early days, insisting it was "business as usual". Most memorably, he told a Downing Street briefing that he "shook hands with everybody" during a hospital visit in early March. With the support of scientific advisers, Johnson took the decision to lift border restrictions on 13 March last year after evidence emerged that the virus was already circulating in the UK, despite a strict quarantine regime for arrivals from Wuhan, in China. At the time, the harsher approach adopted early on by countries such as Singapore and New Zealand, involving flight bans and quarantine, were regarded as extreme by ministers. But many analysts now believe closing the borders was an important precaution that helped these countries and others fare much better. Johnson announced a full-blown lockdown on 23 March last year, with little idea at the time that it would remain in place until July, with many children kept out of the classroom until September. He had edged towards the shutdown via a series of intermediate steps, including banning mass public events and exhorting the public to avoid unnecessary social interaction and to work from home where possible. Only when modelling carried out by Prof Neil Ferguson at Imperial College London suggested there could be up to 500,000 deaths if the virus was not brought under control, and amid growing signs that the public were taking matters into their own hands, did Johnson order the public to stay at home. Some public health experts now believe an earlier shutdown could have saved many thousands of lives. When it emerged that his top adviser had flouted lockdown rules by driving 300-plus miles to Durham, with a day trip to a local town thrown in, Johnson stuck by him resolutely. He told the public at a Downing Street press conference that his aide had acted "responsibly and legally", in crisscrossing the country, ostensibly to seek childcare for his young son, and then to test his eyesight, at a time when the public were being urged to stay at home. His decision sparked an avalanche of angry emails to MPs and risked undermining public confidence in lockdown rules at a critical time. The former TalkTalk executive Dido Harding was brought in by Johnson and Matt Hancock to run the hugely costly test-and-trace system, which has relied heavily on private sector outsourcing and has not worked as effectively as hoped. Councils carrying out their own local contact-tracing operations have generally obtained better results than the call centres run by Serco and other providers, while management consultants have in some cases been paid £7,000 a day for their expertise in setting it up. Johnson and his chancellor, Rishi Sunak, have declined to fix holes in the social safety net – including the paucity of statutory sick pay – that have created a strong financial disincentive for many people to self-isolate. Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance gave the prime minister a briefing on 16 September setting out the dire risks of allowing the virus to run unchecked as cases increased into the autumn. Their colleagues on the Sage committee suggested a short "circuit-breaker" lockdown, perhaps over the October half-term. But Downing Street aides made clear at the time that Johnson considered it to be his role to weigh up scientific advice with other considerations, including the economic and social costs of a fresh lockdown. He therefore opted for a middle course, between the scientists' proposal and the demands of many in his party to resist fresh restrictions: a beefed-up system of "tiers", with tougher rules for the hardest-hit areas. In the event, as Whitty predicted when they were introduced, even the strictest, tier 3 rules did not do enough to restrain the virus, and a month-long lockdown was announced on 31 October. A month before Christmas, the government agreed a plan with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland administrations that would allow up to three households to mix for a fixed five days over the festive period. Johnson then stuck resolutely by the plan, even as cases surged in London and Kent. Matt Hancock alerted the House of Commons to concerns about a new variant of the virus on 14 December,
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour's performance on Thursday was widely seen as the final straw for Keir Starmer, who has insisted he wants to focus on winning the next general election rather than focusing on tackling the pandemic. The disease is now continuing to spread to a much wider range of people, with polls narrowing significantly in Wales and victories in Hartlepool and North Wales.  Appearing on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, hours before Labour was due to launch a sweeping national campaign, Starmer was asked directly whether he would consider himself "above the fray". He replied: "No, not really." less Starmer was speaking in venues including business revved up with speeches by Steve Reed and Stephen Hammond. Johnson was later expected to make a broader speech on Saturday, where he will give a major speech setting out Labour's plans for the coming months. But by that point the party's autumn plans had changed dramatically, and Starmer said he would not be taking part in a leadership challenge. "I'm not taking any part in any leadership campaign," he said. Instead, he would focus on focusing on taking on Labour's core voters, the ones Labour hopes to win over in droves on the final days of the pandemic. "We need to make sure that we take those people on," he said. "We need to make sure that we have staff, to staff the factories. We need to have staff in the pits." The shortage of pit stops has had a devastating impact on Labour's economic strategy since the onset of the pandemic. The policy never quite got across to the public the way it needed to. Tony Blair's "levelling up" pledge, which set out a mix of locally elected and council-based seats for a time, was replaced by the "1 Labour national insurance contribution" in 2019, which will initially fund the spread of the vaccine but will fund the spread of the disease in all parts of the country. Michael Gove has insisted the government is notlocked on to the idea of levelling up, pointing out that many local authorities have already taken steps to make the idea work, like adopting a 1% "levelling up" fund. But under the plans, which were narrowly passed by MPs on Tuesday, any changes would be automaticallyapproved and would be implemented across the country.
====================
<|startofarticle|>    As the prime minister prepares to announce his "new deal for the country" on Wednesday, the new health secretary, Sajid Javid, is taking on a new role – perhaps inevitably one of new director of communications, Katy Clark, or chief information officer, Jenny Chapman, or both. Yes, there have been some obvious suggestions that she might want to take on a more senior role, such as special adviser to the prime minister or special adviser to the new campaign coordinator, Yvette Cooper, or both. But Johnson has repeatedly declined to support the process of nationalising the mainstay of the NHS, and has instead said he wants to hand it off to a younger, more promising cast of eyes. Perhaps most damning, however, is the way in which Johnson's popularity has accelerated since Biden's election. While the prime minister was gleeful about the prospect of a "big bang" nationalisation of the big six energy companies on Wednesday, the Treasury was left scrambling to establish the details, and Downing Street repeatedly leaned into the public offering of freebies like the free jab. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, once boasted that he had "seen better days past". And the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales have been able to hold joint press conferences on the potential for a nationalisation of the NHS and social care. There were also hints that the new campaign coordinator, Shabana Mahmood, could be brought in from outside government, if the faltering performance of Johnson's "levelling up" slogan is resolved. Johnson's official spokesperson has insisted the "same-old Tory party" were the first to notice the differences between the two men and the lack of "big bang" nationalisation, and that Johnson had "done his duty by the institution". But Sunak's comments came as Johnson and his team hope they have earned the trust of the public rather than being exposed. No 10 had previously denied it was planning a "big bang" nationalisation of the economy, but ministers are now hoping to take the public on a tour of a new industrial park to show the public the "levelling up" idea. The government had previously promised a "levelling up" would come into focus talks with the public, and was hoping to be able to get a better reception from the public than from a planned shakeup of the approach. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been pushing for more generous payments to the over-50s and care workers who helped them get on boards the NHS.  Ministers had previously been sceptical about the need for this level of detail, fearing the payments industry was likely to demand more. But when Johnson announced this week that he had "picked his battles" to provoke the NHS to revolt, the warnings of discharging so many thousands of workers into lockdown were sounded. Hardly the "levelling up" slogan. The prime minister was evidently having none of it. "The divisions that have been growing for years are not the result of a political choice," he said. "They are the result of a long period of relative prosperity for many people, driven by the same underlying forces." Instead, he claimed, the underlying causes of the current problems were much more complex. "The same underlying forces that have undermined that period of relative prosperity – the great recession of the last decade, the great economic crisis of the last decade – are driving up wages in many parts of the economy." He suggested the government could yet find itself "in a position where we are not only unequal but insecure as well". By contrast, he said that the challenges were "weakened if we are not ambitious and unwisely – and we've built up a huge amount of debt over the last 10 years that has created some of the biggest challenges to the current trajectory of the economy". The prime minister was speaking as he arrived in the US for a three-day visit, after reshuffling his cabinet last week. Johnson reshuffled his team in a way that often baffled political scientists – he gave in to the temptation to make radical changes to win the next general election, for example. Johnson gave his own go-ahead last week, days before leaving for a weekend in California, after furious warnings from the devolved administrations about the risks of anarchy. The government in north Wales has confirmed that a shake-up of the approach is under way. It is understood the government still considers the idea of nationalising energy companies to be a reasonable one, given the damage done by unreliable supply chains. The former Labour adviser James Meadway, who is on the advisory panel of Andrew Scattergood, has said the idea is "like the bad old days when we were just trading electric cars – diesel-based cars with a petrol engine. We looked over our options and realised [it] looked like a good idea at the time". He suggested the new regime would focus on developing a new skills shortage, the government's headline task of tackling the energy crisis. Johnson's official spokesperson has insisted the current
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, has said her own experience as a care worker helped to convince her more flexible working could be a "win-win" for staff and employers. Speaking to the Guardian after announcing new policies last week on employment rights and flexible conditions, Rayner said she had helped negotiate family-friendly working when she was a trade union representative.  "We were frontline manual workers, delivering 7am till 10pm care in people's homes. We introduced a flexible rota that worked for the staff, and we saw productivity go up. The wellbeing of the staff, as well as the outcome for the service user, was they had the same staff going in – and sickness levels went significantly down as well, so it saved money for the employer. It's a win-win," she said. "Of course, not everything can be achieved in every single workplace, but there are flexible options I believe in every workplace. If an employer looks after the employees, the employees will look after the employer, and it's reciprocal," she added. Rayner announced this week that a Labour government would legislate to give companies an obligation to provide flexible conditions – including compressed hours, and accommodating caring responsibilities such as the school run – unless they can show it is unworkable. It was part of a package of measures, drawn up with the shadow workers' rights minister, Andy McDonald, that also included ensuring all employees gain rights from day one in a job. The plans have been welcomed by the Corbynite campaign group Momentum, and helped to assuage fears among some in the party that Starmer would ditch the radical 2019 manifesto wholesale. Speaking after a visit to a flexible working hub in Hull, Rayner said Labour's aim was nothing less than to achieve a "cultural shift" in the workplace. "It's about changing the culture in our country. The whole emphasis to me is, yes there's individual nuggets in here, but it's about a cultural shift away from people being inflexible, and not looking for new and fresh ideas about how people can engage in the workplace," she said. Rayner shrugged off suggestions that she has been at loggerheads with Keir Starmer – or could even challenge him for the leadership, as some supporters had urged her to do before the Batley and Spen byelection earlier this month. "Me and Keir have been working incredibly closely together since the start of the pandemic," she said, comparing the day when they were both elected in the depths of the first lockdown to "an arranged marriage, almost, by telephone". "We bring different things to that leadership. And I think that works," she said, calling them "yin and yang". Labour's loss of the Hartlepool constituency in May sparked panic about Starmer's prospects of leading Labour to a general election victory, with some MPs quietly casting around for a candidate who could gather the 40 signatures necessary to mount a challenge. But his leadership has appeared more secure since the party held the Yorkshire seat of Batley and Spen. Rayner said she and Starmer had different approaches. "You know, my style is more robust as people know: I'm more bombastic, in the way in which do things, I say it how I see it: and therefore I bring that freshness to the partnership." "Keir's very forensic, he's very intelligent. He's very passionate about making sure that the country is a better place," she said. Rayner has spoken in the past about growing up in poverty, and becoming a carer for her mother, who struggled with mental illness, from the age of 10. "I like to think I overshare and Keir undershares," she said. "If you look at Keir's background, it's not dissimilar for mine: he looked after his mum, I looked after my mum," she says. "Keir wasn't from a privileged background". Challenged about a dip in Labour's membership, Rayner said she was focused on voters. "Of course we want to attract people to be members of the Labour party, but what we need to do is we need to attract voters as well. And what we're doing is we're speaking to the country: we're saying that actually we don't want to be an opposition, we want to be a government," she said. Labour is in the process of laying off up to 90 staff via voluntary redundancies, as Starmer seeks to repair the party's shattered finances after costly election battles and a string of legal cases. The former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott criticised Labour this week for simultaneously seeking to hire staff on six-month contracts to handle a backlog of complaints against members. "So Keir will make Britain the best place to work – unless you work for Labour," Abbott tweeted. Rayner rejected that, highlighting the importance of ensuring the party is financially viable. "We don't want to be making staff redundant. It's an awful situation but
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Jeremy Corbyn has pledged to campaign against the arrival of Rupert Murdoch's News UK television channel as he launched his Peace and Justice Project at an online rally. A more "just, free and accountable" media is one of four causes Corbyn is encouraging his supporters to back. He also urged them to help with organising direct support in communities, such as food banks; campaign for a green new deal; and press the government to speed up the delivery of Covid vaccines in developing countries.  "So many of the ideas we need to make the 2020s better than the 2010s were developed in and around the Labour party in recent years, by outstanding thinkers, but more importantly by demands of our movements, and the skills, knowledge and needs of the communities affected," Corbyn said. "We will build on these policies, taking them further, adapting them to the post-pandemic world, so that our movement can turn the dial towards peace and justice." Corbyn was readmitted to the Labour party in November, after being suspended over remarks he made when the Equality and Human Rights Commission published its critical report on the party's handling of antisemitism. But his successor as leader, Keir Starmer, declined to restore the Labour whip to Corbyn, who now sits as an independent MP. The broadcasting regulator, Ofcom, gave the go-ahead last month to Murdoch's right-leaning news channel, which is expected to be on air for four to five hours a night. It is expected to compete with Andrew Neil's GB News, with the pair racing to be the first on air. Corbyn repeatedly criticised the role of the media in public life during his time as leader of the opposition. He was ridiculed in some of Murdoch's newspapers, with the Sun's front page on election day in 2017 urging its readers: "Don't chuck Britain in the Cor-bin." Corbyn gave a lecture at the Edinburgh television festival in 2018 calling for a taxpayer-owned British Digital Corporation to offset the power of multinational corporations in the media, though the policy never found its way into Labour's manifesto. His digital rally also featured Greece's former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis and the Labour MP for Coventry South, Zarah Sultana. The new initiative will not be signing up members but Corbyn hopes to play a convening role in bringing together activists, trade unions and other leftwing groups. Setting out the aims of his new political venture, he appeared to take a sideswipe at his successor, saying: "If you refuse to argue for your side, our opponents win by default." Some of Corbyn's allies believe Starmer has not been sufficiently robust in attacking Boris Johnson's government – and fear backsliding from some of the radical policies set out in the 2019 general election manifesto. Starmer has adopted the slogan "a new leadership" to differentiate his tenure from Corbyn's four-and-a-half-year period at the top of the party.

<|startofarticle|>  Rutger Thacker, the darling of MPs and donors, has announced that MPs will be allowed to boycott the Conservative party conference in October if – as planned – the prime minister changes sides with Patel or demands more. The £4bn cap on health and social care costs for the first time will apply to all over-50s and those with a high school education.  Thacker said as well as being able to use the conference to demand a bigger role for the NHS in the aftermath of the pandemic, the decision was also a call to arms to the public. "The health service has got to be at the centre of our concerns. If that is not the focus of our conversations then we have got to be more cautious about taking these actions on the road," he said. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been pushing for more generous payments to workers self-isolating, but been rebuffed by the Treasury, which believes financial incentives are not the main reason many people fail to stay at home when requested to. When the death toll from the virus exceeded 100,000 earlier this year, the prime minister said his government, "did everything we could" in "a very, very difficult stage, and a very, very difficult crisis for our country". But Reeves said the government failed to learn lessons from the earlier phases of the pandemic. "We already think opportunities have been missed to get on top of this and do things better," she said. The government has consistently refused to be pinned down on when an inquiry should start, and who should lead it. On Wednesday, the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said it would be "premature" to launch an inquiry, arguing instead that the reopening of the economy was the main priority. "Once the economy is reopened, once we've got through the worst of the pandemic – and it's still with us – we can have a debate and I'm sure that there'll be plenty of room for an inquiry."

<|startofarticle|>  Boris Johnson has said "we truly did everything we could" to minimise loss of life from coronavirus, and insisted he takes "full responsibility" for the government's handling of the pandemic. Speaking to journalists en route to an announcement at the Eden Project on Wednesday, the prime minister said he wanted to make clear at the weekend that the UK was "not remotely a corrupt country".  He cited cases of "sleaze" being thrown at the government, and wrongly stated that the Lib Dems had lost the backing of the Treasury. Johnson's official spokesperson has insisted the government has "full confidence" in Raab, who was voted the country's highest office in 2013 but has been removed from his post. But Johnson's spokesperson conceded that the government had removed a number of "particular advisers" from their posts during the pandemic, and had advised the public to be cautious. "We have full confidence in Angela as a responsible, responsible and transparent government," he said. Johnson also stressed the "prodigious" increase in fishing catches he said the UK would now be allowed to keep. Despite the fact exporters will now face increased friction at the border, he claimed he had struck "a deal which will if anything allow our companies and our exporters to do even more business with our European friends". His optimism contrasts with the expectations of the government's own independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, which expects Brexit to shave 4% off GDP in the medium term. The fishing industry was also disappointed that Johnson had not secured control of the 12 miles of fishing waters off the coast of Britain. Barrie Deas, head of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, said: "I think what I would say is that there's a gap between the rhetoric and the delivery … I think the industry will be bitterly disappointed. I think there will be fury about the failure to secure an exclusive 12-mile zone." Most of Johnson's themes in his speech, including sovereignty, regulatory independence and fishing, were those close to the hearts of the Brexit-backing MPs who helped him to win the Tory leadership last year. With MPs set to vote on the agreement on Wednesday 30 December, Downing Street has kept Eurosceptic backbenchers closely informed as negotiations developed. After the deal was struck, many said they would await the verdict of a "star chamber" of experts convened by the backbench European Research Group to go through the agreement line by line. The group, consisting of lawyers and politicians including the former Europe minister David Jones, is not expected to publish its conclusions until Monday. The prime minister urged Brexiters and remainers to move on from the divisions that have plagued UK politics since the referendum. "My message to everybody on both sides of that argument in 2016 is I really think now it's a long time behind us," he said. He claimed the UK would remain "culturally, emotionally, historically, strategically and geologically attached to Europe, not least through the 4 million EU nationals who have requested to settle in the UK over the last four years and who make an enormous contribution to our country and to our lives".

<|startofarticle|>  Keir Starmer is calling on Boris Johnson to scrap his plans for a "vanity yacht" and instead spend the money on tackling antisocial behaviour. Pledging to make Labour "the party of law and order", Starmer highlighted the blight of antisocial behaviour, such as off-road bikes and high-powered cars being raced through residential neighbourhoods.  "As chief prosecutor, I saw far too many examples of crimes perceived as 'low-level' not being tackled quickly enough before they escalate," the Labour leader said. "People can end up afraid in their own homes, or scared to go out at night." In a sign that Starmer may be heeding the pleas of his MPs for him to attack Johnson more forcefully, he added: "I not only understand deeply why tackling antisocial behaviour is needed, but I'm frustrated by the prime minister's priorities. His multimillion-pound vanity yacht isn't addressing people's everyday concerns. Labour will scrap it and fund crime fighting instead." The prime minister's spokesperson recently announced plans for the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to buy a "national flagship", which could be used to host trade delegations. The decision followed a long-running campaign by Johnson's former newspaper the Daily Telegraph for taxpayers to fund a replacement for the Royal Yacht Britannia. While the MoD will be in charge of the procurement process, it is unclear which department will foot the bill. Johnson claimed the vessel would underline the UK's "burgeoning status as a great, independent maritime trading nation". The yacht is expected to cost up to £200m, and Labour estimates the running costs could be £83m over the course of a parliament – based on updating the cost of running the Britannia to 2021 prices. Starmer said that money could be used to create a £285m enforcement fund, allocated to antisocial behaviour hotspots, to provide surge policing, or fund additional CCTV or extra council enforcement officers. Labour would also legislate to crack down on antisocial driving – by requiring a "black box" to be fixed to high-powered rental cars to ensure they were tracked, for example. The party is keen to highlight its determination to crack down on crime, and underscore the impact of police and local authority cuts under successive Conservative governments. Labour strategists believe crime is one of the policy areas that can unite voters on both sides of its fragile electoral coalition – working-class voters in former industrial "red wall" seats and city-based graduates. Starmer's rejection of the national yacht plan may stir memories among Labour veterans of Tony Blair's 1997 stump speeches, when he repeatedly criticised the plans of the then defence secretary, Michael Portillo, for a royal yacht, saying Labour would not waste money on the plan. Then, as now, the Conservatives claimed the vessel would benefit UK trade. Tackling low-level neighbourhood crime was also a recurrent theme for Labour in power, with Blair's government legislating to create antisocial behaviour orders, or Asbos. Starmer has just hired a veteran of the Blair years, Matthew Doyle, to be his temporary director of communications, as longstanding aide Ben Nunn departs. Labour also confirmed that another close Starmer ally, Jenny Chapman, is moving to a frontbench position in the House of Lords, shadowing the government's Brexit minister, David Frost. The moves are part of a thorough shake-up of the Labour leader's backroom operation, with more changes expected to be announced after next week's Batley and Spen byelection.

<|startofarticle|>  Keir Starmer has appointed well-respected north-east of England MP Sharon Hodgson as his new parliamentary aide, as he seeks to smooth relations with Labour backbenchers after last weekend's fraught reshuffle. Hodgson, the MP for Washington and Sunderland West since 2010, replaces Carolyn Harris, who resigned earlier this week amid claims that she had stoked up tensions between Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner.  As Starmer's parliamentary private secretary, her job will be to liaise between backbenchers and the leader's office. Some MPs have complained in recent weeks that they felt neglected by Starmer's team. Hodgson will also bring understanding of the north-east, where Labour lost the Hartlepool byelection last week, and the Conservatives made fresh inroads in local council elections. Labour announced several other junior appointments on Friday evening, as the Labour leader completed the shakeup that began in the wake of last week's election results. Peter Kyle, the Hove MP, will be the shadow schools minister, after Wes Streeting was handed a new role overseeing Labour's child poverty strategy. Streeting announced on Friday that he will step back from frontline politics for the time being after being diagnosed with kidney cancer. The leftwinger Andy McDonald will have a beefed-up role in Rayner's new team, as shadow secretary of state for employment rights and protections. Seema Malhotra will be shadow business and consumer minister, replacing Lucy Powell, who was promoted last week to be shadow housing secretary. Other changes include a return to the fold for several MPs who had resigned for various reasons. Flo Eshalomi, MP for Vauxhall, who resigned rather than vote for Boris Johnson's Brexit in December, returns as Rayner's new parliamentary private secretary. Olivia Blake, the MP for Sheffield Hallam, who stepped down over Labour's stance on the overseas operations bill, returns as shadow minister for nature. Starmer's plans for overhauling his frontbench last weekend were held up for much of last Sunday by negotiations with Rayner about what role she would be willing to accept. She relinquished the jobs of party chair and national campaign coordinator, and was instead handed the role of shadowing the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, as well as other titles, including shadow secretary of state for the future of work.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, has said her own experience as a care worker helped to convince her more flexible working could be a "win-win" for staff and employers. Speaking to the Guardian after announcing new policies last week on employment rights and flexible conditions, Rayner said she had helped negotiate family-friendly working when she was a trade union representative.  "We were frontline manual workers, delivering 7am till 10pm care in people's homes. We introduced a flexible rota that worked for the staff, and we saw productivity go up. The wellbeing of the staff, as well as the outcome for the service user, was they had the same staff going in – and sickness levels went significantly down as well, so it saved money for the employer. It's a win-win," she said. "Of course, not everything can be achieved in every single workplace, but there are flexible options I believe in every workplace. If an employer looks after the employees, the employees will look after the employer, and it's reciprocal," she added. Rayner announced this week that a Labour government would legislate to give companies an obligation to provide flexible conditions – including compressed hours, and accommodating caring responsibilities such as the school run – unless they can show it is unworkable. It was part of a package of measures, drawn up with the shadow workers' rights minister, Andy McDonald, that also included ensuring all employees gain rights from day one in a job. The plans have been welcomed by the Corbynite campaign group Momentum, and helped to assuage fears among some in the party that Starmer would ditch the radical 2019 manifesto wholesale. Speaking after a visit to a flexible working hub in Hull, Rayner said Labour's aim was nothing less than to achieve a "cultural shift" in the workplace. "It's about changing the culture in our country. The whole emphasis to me is, yes there's individual nuggets in here, but it's about a cultural shift away from people being inflexible, and not looking for new and fresh ideas about how people can engage in the workplace," she said. Rayner shrugged off suggestions that she has been at loggerheads with Keir Starmer – or could even challenge him for the leadership, as some supporters had urged her to do before the Batley and Spen byelection earlier this month. "Me and Keir have been working incredibly closely together since the start of the pandemic," she said, comparing the day when they were both elected in the depths of the first lockdown to "an arranged marriage, almost, by telephone". "We bring different things to that leadership. And I think that works," she said, calling them "yin and yang". Labour's loss of the Hartlepool constituency in May sparked panic about Starmer's prospects of leading Labour to a general election victory, with some MPs quietly casting around for a candidate who could gather the 40 signatures necessary to mount a challenge. But his leadership has appeared more secure since the party held the Yorkshire seat of Batley and Spen. Rayner said she and Starmer had different approaches. "You know, my style is more robust as people know: I'm more bombastic, in the way in which do things, I say it how I see it: and therefore I bring that freshness to the partnership." "Keir's very forensic, he's very intelligent. He's very passionate about making sure that the country is a better place," she said. Rayner has spoken in the past about growing up in poverty, and becoming a carer for her mother, who struggled with mental illness, from the age of 10. "I like to think I overshare and Keir undershares," she said. "If you look at Keir's background, it's not dissimilar for mine: he looked after his mum, I looked after my mum," she says. "Keir wasn't from a privileged background". Challenged about a dip in Labour's membership, Rayner said she was focused on voters. "Of course we want to attract people to be members of the Labour party, but what we need to do is we need to attract voters as well. And what we're doing is we're speaking to the country: we're saying that actually we don't want to be an opposition, we want to be a government," she said. Labour is in the process of laying off up to 90 staff via voluntary redundancies, as Starmer seeks to repair the party's shattered finances after costly election battles and a string of legal cases. The former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott criticised Labour this week for simultaneously seeking to hire staff on six-month contracts to handle a backlog of complaints against members. "So Keir will make Britain the best place to work – unless you work for Labour," Abbott tweeted. Rayner rejected that, highlighting the importance of ensuring the party is financially viable. "We don't want to be making staff redundant. It's an awful situation but

<|startofarticle|>  Rutger Thacker, the darling of the ultra-rich, is set to be questioned by the House of Commons science and technology committees for several hours as part of their inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic. As a backbencher, Thacker was critical in exposing the private research into the safety of the vaccination programme, which was being conducted on behalf of the Biovis Biopharmaceutical Company.  The company's founders had been alarmed by the success of the vaccination programme and the potential for transmission of the disease. But in order to give themselves the chance to take on the role of guardian of the public, Johnson has added a new adviser to his inner circle – a friend of Matt Hancock, who is known to have expressed concerns about the idea of a daily dose of the vaccine. Thacker also sacked the chief scientific adviser, who reports to George Osborne; replaced him with a new director of policy, who may well be willing to take on a more senior role; and strengthened the "safe, open and transparent" rule, including making it harder to freeze communications data. He also removed the commissioner for nature, Kathryn Stone, from her post – a move that may well be motivated partly by the importance of protecting the pollinator. Johnson's reshuffle of the cabinet was derailed by a prolonged standoff with Reed Morrissey, who was widely seen as the favourite to win over the mavericks of the scientific community at Westminster. The former adviser was investigated and discredited for his role in allowing a member of staff on a first draft of the story to leave his post.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour is calling on the Conservative party to pay back £580,000 of taxpayers' money spent by the government on polling, including testing public attitudes to Keir Starmer, at the height of the Covid crisis. Angela Rayner has written to the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, urging him to investigate the contract, which was awarded after the personal intervention of Boris Johnson's then chief adviser, Dominic Cummings.  Rayner said: "Conservative ministers have abused taxpayers' money for their own party political interests and the Conservative party needs to repay this money immediately. "Taxpayers' money is not the personal cashpoint of Tory ministers to do as they please with. We need a fully independent inquiry into how much taxpayers' money has been abused in this way and which rules were broken by the ministers and special advisers who authorised it." Cummings phoned his former Vote Leave colleague Paul Stephenson, who also worked on the Tories' 2019 general election campaign, to ask if Stephenson's company, Hanbury Strategy, could carry out the work in March last year. As part of the polling contract, the company examined public attitudes to Starmer and London mayor Sadiq Khan. One proposal under discussion at the time was to hold joint press conferences with Johnson and Starmer, against the backdrop of concerns about compliance with lockdown, in particular among members of the public who mistrusted the Conservatives. The plan was rejected by Downing Street before it had even been mooted with Starmer's team, but Labour argues that by testing the public's attitude to the Labour leader and Khan, Hanbury was carrying out political work, which should never have been funded with taxpayers' money. Hanbury had previously been brought in to sift potential candidates to be special advisers in Johnson's government. Rayner has called on Case to investigate whether Johnson or cabinet office minister Michael Gove, the former chair of Vote Leave, were involved in awarding the contract – and whether other sums of public money were spent on political activities. The contract with Hanbury, to conduct opinion polls on the public's view of the government's Covid response, is subject to a legal challenge by the Good Law Project (GLP), which argues that it shows "apparent bias". Documents made public at a court hearing last Friday included an email sent on 20 March 2020, in which Cummings asked the most senior civil servant responsible for contracts to sign off the budget immediately, and that if "anybody in CABOFF [the Cabinet Office] whines", to tell them Cummings had "ordered it" from the prime minister. The Cabinet Office, which is defending the GLP's challenge, has insisted it acted lawfully, and that the polling was used to shape public health messaging at a critical time in the pandemic. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: "We do not carry out party political polling." They added that an independent review of cabinet office procurement had already been carried out last December by Nigel Boardman. A Hanbury spokesperson said the company agreed to do the work "at extremely short notice" although it involved reputational risk. They said: "Our work contributed to what was a hugely successful public health communications campaign which undoubtedly prevented many deaths. For that reason, if we had to make the choice again we would still agree to step up and help in this time of crisis."
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Keir Starmer is committed to debating plans for a green new deal at Labour's conference later this month, his team have insisted, despite the party having rejected a grassroots motion on the issue. The shadow cabinet still hopes to table a motion in the coming days setting out the position of the party on the green new deal issue.  Starmer's team insist they were not forced to make the decision on Tuesday, however, as he continues to tour Europe, attending plenary sessions and meeting voters. They cited a lack of concrete proposals to sell to a sceptical electorate. "There's no coherent narrative to explain the dramatic shift in the public mood since the election," said Steve Reed. "The general election was the ultimate straw that broke the camel's back. The Conservative party spent £80,000 on TV a day before the election, and the goodwill of the Labour campaign machine after the last round of the Corbyn wave was seriously damaged by the failure to really grasp the message." "The best way forward is forward looking only now," said Steve Reed. "The Tories have taken the best ideas from the Labour party and put them into action – not the slogans. Starmer needs to put the bad blood between his two halves behind him." The party's finances have been hit hard by fighting three general elections in the past six years, as well as a string of costly legal cases. "Labour is fundamentally different from the other parties in that it has a vision: it has a programme," said Steve Reed. "The Labour party has got to look after the people it needs to do, and that means working towards a green new deal."

====================
<|startofarticle|>  Boris Johnson has said "we truly did everything we could" to minimise loss of life from coronavirus, and insisted he takes "full responsibility" for the government's handling of the pandemic. But when an inquiry is eventually carried out into the past 12 torrid months, the prime minister will have to face a series of difficult questions about key decisions he made.  As news first began to trickle out of China, triggering the government's pandemic planning, the prime minister left the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to chair the first five meetings of the emergency Cobra committee about the virus. After carrying out a fraught reshuffle of his cabinet, Johnson decamped to the taxpayer-owned mansion of Chevening, and did not chair his first Covid Cobra meeting until 2 March, just before the first confirmed UK death from the virus. Comforted by advisers who compared the challenge to tackling seasonal flu, he tended to play down the seriousness of the pandemic in its early days, insisting it was "business as usual". Most memorably, he told a Downing Street briefing that he "shook hands with everybody" during a hospital visit in early March. With the support of scientific advisers, Johnson took the decision to lift border restrictions on 13 March last year after evidence emerged that the virus was already circulating in the UK, despite a strict quarantine regime for arrivals from Wuhan, in China. At the time, the harsher approach adopted early on by countries such as Singapore and New Zealand, involving flight bans and quarantine, were regarded as extreme by ministers. But many analysts now believe closing the borders was an important precaution that helped these countries and others fare much better. Johnson announced a full-blown lockdown on 23 March last year, with little idea at the time that it would remain in place until July, with many children kept out of the classroom until September. He had edged towards the shutdown via a series of intermediate steps, including banning mass public events and exhorting the public to avoid unnecessary social interaction and to work from home where possible. Only when modelling carried out by Prof Neil Ferguson at Imperial College London suggested there could be up to 500,000 deaths if the virus was not brought under control, and amid growing signs that the public were taking matters into their own hands, did Johnson order the public to stay at home. Some public health experts now believe an earlier shutdown could have saved many thousands of lives. When it emerged that his top adviser had flouted lockdown rules by driving 300-plus miles to Durham, with a day trip to a local town thrown in, Johnson stuck by him resolutely. He told the public at a Downing Street press conference that his aide had acted "responsibly and legally", in crisscrossing the country, ostensibly to seek childcare for his young son, and then to test his eyesight, at a time when the public were being urged to stay at home. His decision sparked an avalanche of angry emails to MPs and risked undermining public confidence in lockdown rules at a critical time. The former TalkTalk executive Dido Harding was brought in by Johnson and Matt Hancock to run the hugely costly test-and-trace system, which has relied heavily on private sector outsourcing and has not worked as effectively as hoped. Councils carrying out their own local contact-tracing operations have generally obtained better results than the call centres run by Serco and other providers, while management consultants have in some cases been paid £7,000 a day for their expertise in setting it up. Johnson and his chancellor, Rishi Sunak, have declined to fix holes in the social safety net – including the paucity of statutory sick pay – that have created a strong financial disincentive for many people to self-isolate. Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance gave the prime minister a briefing on 16 September setting out the dire risks of allowing the virus to run unchecked as cases increased into the autumn. Their colleagues on the Sage committee suggested a short "circuit-breaker" lockdown, perhaps over the October half-term. But Downing Street aides made clear at the time that Johnson considered it to be his role to weigh up scientific advice with other considerations, including the economic and social costs of a fresh lockdown. He therefore opted for a middle course, between the scientists' proposal and the demands of many in his party to resist fresh restrictions: a beefed-up system of "tiers", with tougher rules for the hardest-hit areas. In the event, as Whitty predicted when they were introduced, even the strictest, tier 3 rules did not do enough to restrain the virus, and a month-long lockdown was announced on 31 October. A month before Christmas, the government agreed a plan with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland administrations that would allow up to three households to mix for a fixed five days over the festive period. Johnson then stuck resolutely by the plan, even as cases surged in London and Kent. Matt Hancock alerted the House of Commons to concerns about a new variant of the virus on 14 December,

<|startofarticle|> Updated at 7.25pm with further confirmation that line of credit will be extended to those found to have met the entry requirements, Boris Johnson has announced. "Today is the day we've been waiting for, for generations," he said on a visit to the Esher Institute, a thinktank. "This is the moment we've waited 22 more years for – 23 more years without a Tory government. It is therefore not surprising that we must now look forward to a day of unprecedented clarity and clarity and clarity about what the new rules actually are," he said.  He claimed the new regulations, which come into force next month, will "make our country safer by giving law-abiding people the ability to cancel dangerous trips and to stay safe where necessary". "With safer roads and safer public transport we've made our towns and regions safer," he said. "We've also known for a long time that car travel is risky and we all make mistakes like this." Gove has made clear the government is concerned about the potential for corruption in the media, with MPs' reports on its handling of the pandemic a key concern. In a separate briefing to the public on Wednesday, the health secretary, Sajid Javid, was more positive about the safety of travelling in trains and buses, saying: "We're very, very confident that the best travel is going to be between venues in London and the new destinations on the east coast." He suggested there would be a single point of departure for most routes, with no changes made overnight or throughout the week. "We're also very, very confident that with the right kind of transport policy and with the right mix of passengers, we're going to be much more confident in delivering on this campaign of national rejuvenation," he said. The transport secretary, Matt Hancock, has been more positive about the capacity of the Covid booster, saying that 12- to 15-year-olds were "going viral" on social media during the Easter holidays. When the new rules for booster jabs were announced last week, Johnson was quick to point them out that the capacity of the booster was only a count of the number of doses they were planning to take, not the total number of people having the jab. He said the government still believed that person-to-person vaccination was the most effective way to get the jab, but that it would be much more effective if the pubs, clubs and other venues where people gather had been upgraded. "We're seeing 50% of the infections we were seeing last week coming from China," he said. He added: "We're seeing 66% of the infections we were seeing last week coming from Brazil. We know it's a challenge but we're going to have to work very, very closely with the Chinese on this." The prime minister has been buoyed up by the appointment of the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, to a three-year, £20bn contract announced last week. Morrison is expected to be challenged about the climate crisis at the United Nations, with the prime minister using his Christmas message to set out the dire risks of his cause while delivering a press conference in Victoria. The UK has reacted with fury, announcing that they had arrested over 100 people over alleged climate-related activities, some of whom were in contact with scientists. The Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow is being held up to hopes of a better day than last week's chaotic standoff over the implementation of the historic 1.5C limit on global heating. But the government has also warned that the scale of the unrest in Northern Ireland is alarming. The Guardian understands that ministers are concerned that police are not only in much better physical and mental condition than they were in January, but that the threat of crime is also high. The government isager Carlisle MP David Gauke, who chairs the education select committee, has already said he would be willing to help the police to improve their performance. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been stressing for some time that the health impact of the extra infection is minimal, but ministers are concerned about the impact on hospital admissions and deaths of allowing the virus to run unchecked.

"Me and Keir have been working incredibly closely together since the start of the pandemic," she said, comparing the day when they were both elected in the depths of the first lockdown to "an arranged marriage, almost, by telephone". "We bring different things to that leadership. And I think that works," she said, calling them "yin and yang".

<|startofarticle|>  Rutger Thacker, the darling of the ultra-rich and sleaze survivor David Cameron, has become the most senior Conservatives figure to express regret over the Owen Paterson affair, saying the government "must do better" in upholding standards in public life. Speaking to the FT, as he prepared to fly back to London after a weekend of fraught negotiations, the prime minister was asked about the probity of ministers continuing to insist on a tax rise for the well-being of families. "I think the prime minister has a point," he said, adding, "if you look at the spending spree that was just announced today, the one thing that is consistently broken by the Conservatives is the largesse that's been lavishlyaped at us by the government.  Of course we recognise that this is a matter of personal choice, and we all want to improve people's lives but clearly what the Conservatives have done is they have lavished all that money at a time when there was no intensive research work at all into how they did it. And that is disappointing." He added: "I think the prime minister has made the correct decision in the right way by recognising that the best way forward is through the strongest possible communications partnership with companies and institutions." Johnson was not forthcoming with whether he would consider himself "unleashed" with the largesse of the UK's largest tech firms.  He cited the example of the UK's largest tech giant, Hewlett-Packard, which he said invested £100m in developing the new personal computer. Asked whether he was unleashed, he said: "I am perfectly capable of taking on this challenge." Asked again whether he was unleashed, he replied: "I am: I am a committed and ambitious campaigner for digital independence." The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, responding to Johnson, claimed many of the problems in the NHS and care system had existed before the pandemic and accused him of "putting a sticking plaster over a gaping wound". The decision to break an explicit manifesto promise has sparked a backlash among Tory MPs, while Labour has pointed out the impact of NIC increases would be borne by younger, low-income workers. Johnson believes voters will accept the tax increase because of the backdrop of the pandemic. The government was keen to stress that the national insurance increase was progressive, hitting higher earners harder, and with more than 6 million of the lowest earners exempt. The decision to charge the levy to working people of pension age is aimed at addressing the perception that older people will not be paying their share. Conservative MPs could be asked to vote on the proposals as soon as this week, with the government keen to resolve it before the Commons breaks for the annual party conferences in a fortnight.

<|startofarticle|> Angela Rayner has been demoted from shadow minister of state for women and equalities to Tom Watson, after the reshuffle of the party's ruling national executive committee (NEC). The women's issue was on trial for more than a year, and was the focus of intense pressure from the party's leftwingers. But the decision was denied by the supreme court in a significant victory for female MPs, and sparked by the case of Rebecca Long-Bailey, who was found to have committed a "false representation" about her vaccination status.  Since the botched attempt to remove her as party chair in May, several senior figures have been hit by the same backlash, most recently the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell. But some of Starmer's backers on the NEC felt the need to accuse him of "corruption", after the failure to win a single seat at the last general election. As well as seeking to stamp its authority on the party, the shake-up will also see the return of a boardroom presence, as Starmer seeks to show the Tories have been deposed. The Labour leader will also be free to address more public lifebulldozed than usual, as he did during the Jeremy Corbyn years. Rayner, the former shadow chancellor, will now be able to tell her own stories.

<|startofarticle|>  Keir Starmer has appointed well-respected north-east of England MP Sharon Hodgson as his new parliamentary aide, as he seeks to smooth relations with Labour backbenchers after last weekend's fraught reshuffle. Hodgson, the MP for Washington and Sunderland West since 2010, replaces Carolyn Harris, who resigned earlier this week amid claims that she had stoked up tensions between Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner.  As Starmer's parliamentary private secretary, her job will be to liaise between backbenchers and the leader's office. Some MPs have complained in recent weeks that they felt neglected by Starmer's team. Hodgson will also bring understanding of the north-east, where Labour lost the Hartlepool byelection last week, and the Conservatives made fresh inroads in local council elections. Labour announced several other junior appointments on Friday evening, as the Labour leader completed the shakeup that began in the wake of last week's election results. Peter Kyle, the Hove MP, will be the shadow schools minister, after Wes Streeting was handed a new role overseeing Labour's child poverty strategy. Streeting announced on Friday that he will step back from frontline politics for the time being after being diagnosed with kidney cancer. The leftwinger Andy McDonald will have a beefed-up role in Rayner's new team, as shadow secretary of state for employment rights and protections. Seema Malhotra will be shadow business and consumer minister, replacing Lucy Powell, who was promoted last week to be shadow housing secretary. Other changes include a return to the fold for several MPs who had resigned for various reasons. Flo Eshalomi, MP for Vauxhall, who resigned rather than vote for Boris Johnson's Brexit in December, returns as Rayner's new parliamentary private secretary. Olivia Blake, the MP for Sheffield Hallam, who stepped down over Labour's stance on the overseas operations bill, returns as shadow minister for nature. Starmer's plans for overhauling his frontbench last weekend were held up for much of last Sunday by negotiations with Rayner about what role she would be willing to accept. She relinquished the jobs of party chair and national campaign coordinator, and was instead handed the role of shadowing the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, as well as other titles, including shadow secretary of state for the future of work.

<|startofarticle|>  Jeremy Corbyn has pledged to campaign against the arrival of Rupert Murdoch's News UK television channel as he launched his Peace and Justice Project at an online rally. A more "just, free and accountable" media is one of four causes Corbyn is encouraging his supporters to back. He also urged them to help with organising direct support in communities, such as food banks; campaign for a green new deal; and press the government to speed up the delivery of Covid vaccines in developing countries.  "So many of the ideas we need to make the 2020s better than the 2010s were developed in and around the Labour party in recent years, by outstanding thinkers, but more importantly by demands of our movements, and the skills, knowledge and needs of the communities affected," Corbyn said. "We will build on these policies, taking them further, adapting them to the post-pandemic world, so that our movement can turn the dial towards peace and justice." Corbyn was readmitted to the Labour party in November, after being suspended over remarks he made when the Equality and Human Rights Commission published its critical report on the party's handling of antisemitism. But his successor as leader, Keir Starmer, declined to restore the Labour whip to Corbyn, who now sits as an independent MP. The broadcasting regulator, Ofcom, gave the go-ahead last month to Murdoch's right-leaning news channel, which is expected to be on air for four to five hours a night. It is expected to compete with Andrew Neil's GB News, with the pair racing to be the first on air. Corbyn repeatedly criticised the role of the media in public life during his time as leader of the opposition. He was ridiculed in some of Murdoch's newspapers, with the Sun's front page on election day in 2017 urging its readers: "Don't chuck Britain in the Cor-bin." Corbyn gave a lecture at the Edinburgh television festival in 2018 calling for a taxpayer-owned British Digital Corporation to offset the power of multinational corporations in the media, though the policy never found its way into Labour's manifesto. His digital rally also featured Greece's former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis and the Labour MP for Coventry South, Zarah Sultana. The new initiative will not be signing up members but Corbyn hopes to play a convening role in bringing together activists, trade unions and other leftwing groups. Setting out the aims of his new political venture, he appeared to take a sideswipe at his successor, saying: "If you refuse to argue for your side, our opponents win by default." Some of Corbyn's allies believe Starmer has not been sufficiently robust in attacking Boris Johnson's government – and fear backsliding from some of the radical policies set out in the 2019 general election manifesto. Starmer has adopted the slogan "a new leadership" to differentiate his tenure from Corbyn's four-and-a-half-year period at the top of the party.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Rutger Thacker, the darling of business groups and trade unions, will tell Labour local government leaders that Brexit cannot continue because the law of the road is "not secure", as he attacked the government's handling of the crisis. The home secretary, Priti Patel, was a late addition to the government's leak prevention order, and as well as Starmer's number two, has had to brush off allegations that she has been pressing for tighter restrictions.  Instead, she will underline the close links between the new workers' rights minister, Liz Truss, and the economic priorities of the new care home parents, or risk a significant backbench rebellion, all of whom are being urged to help by the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty. "Labour is committed to repealing the broken laws of the road and the pressures that are already beginning to mount on our laws and our institutions," Thacker said in a statement. "We are also calling on ministers to reintroduce more stringent measures … now more than ever we need to be tough on crime, protecting consumers and levelling up," he added. A separate rebellion by care home parents could spark a revolt on the government's doorstep, if the campaign group Covid-19 goes ahead. The government has been gripped by a long-running dispute with the parents of the youngest children in its care homes, who are then left unscathed by the NICs rise. Johnson's former chief aide Dominic Cummings has repeatedly criticised the Hopkins parents for delaying the inevitable onset of the pandemic until the last minute. The government on Wednesday rejected Cummings' findings that the wait was "unacceptable" and rejected claims that Johnson had been influenced by newspaper stories. As well as Cummings, there are seven members of the OnTheHunt board, including three ministers of wine and spirits, including the former prime minister Gordon Brown. His wife, Carrie the bestselling author and critic Ursula von der Leyen, is a director of advertising and has worked with Von Der Leyen on a variety of campaigns. A close ally of Johnson said: "She's very supportive of the prime minister and he loves Lucy and knows the values and traditions that make up the great British empire." Von Der Leyen was Johnson's most senior adviser on the culture and culture of the 1960s and 1970s, and was closely involved in developing the Snapchat app, which allows users to show photos of people being filmed in their homes.  He was also a key figure in the government's creation under the auspices of its successful Operation Green Dot strategy, in which former foes of the UK's intelligence operations have pencilled up evidence that foreign governments and other entities are actively developing technologies and procedures for tracking and disrupting communications threats. In a 2017 blogpost, he compared the state's role in culture to that of the wartime general, General George Patton, who was given the job of "levelling up" but was unable to carry out his full-blown offensive. "Without wanting to pre-empt the grainy nature of Von Der Leyen's photograph, we are told that he spent part of his wartime career restoring the visual language and thinking behind the curtain, to the time when visual communications were primitive, but they were the foundation for the idea of the time," he said. "But, in fact, the visual communications hub created by the Operation Green Dot website, and which they claims is powered by deep public trust, is just the latest example of the prime minister using his political muscle to 'levelling up' his former party." The former permanent secretary to the Treasury Nick Macpherson has claimed in a new book that Johnson repeatedly warned the then foreign secretary, Liz Truss, that he would "hammer" the labour movement. As the prime minister's health and social care advisers rushed to make the announcement for the public, Truss was giving a press conference smack in the middle of the discussion of workers' rights, human rights and the climate crisis. The Labour leader was asked about this during a visit to a farming community in the Midlands, where he was raising concerns about the impact of a dip in the growth in the taper in the taper in the life expectancy of the population. "The question that everybody is asking themselves is: is it time to step back and think about the long-term prospects for our country?" he said. "We know that the people of this area want a better future and that's why we need to bring about a government programme to ensure that people on both sides of that divide can live an extended family." Johnson's official spokesperson has insisted that the taper is the natural state of the game, after a dip in the growth in the taper set back the state's ability to intervene in it. But Truss's spokesperson said the taper was a measure of the level of resilience in the population – and economic well-being of the area – known as the "metropolitan area". "The natural outlier is the area that is closer to the equator, the home counties,

<|startofarticle|>  Boris Johnson has said "we truly did everything we could" to minimise loss of life from coronavirus, and insisted he takes "full responsibility" for the government's handling of the pandemic. But when an inquiry is eventually carried out into the past 12 torrid months, the prime minister will have to face a series of difficult questions about key decisions he made.  As news first began to trickle out of China, triggering the government's pandemic planning, the prime minister left the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to chair the first five meetings of the emergency Cobra committee about the virus. After carrying out a fraught reshuffle of his cabinet, Johnson decamped to the taxpayer-owned mansion of Chevening, and did not chair his first Covid Cobra meeting until 2 March, just before the first confirmed UK death from the virus. Comforted by advisers who compared the challenge to tackling seasonal flu, he tended to play down the seriousness of the pandemic in its early days, insisting it was "business as usual". Most memorably, he told a Downing Street briefing that he "shook hands with everybody" during a hospital visit in early March. With the support of scientific advisers, Johnson took the decision to lift border restrictions on 13 March last year after evidence emerged that the virus was already circulating in the UK, despite a strict quarantine regime for arrivals from Wuhan, in China. At the time, the harsher approach adopted early on by countries such as Singapore and New Zealand, involving flight bans and quarantine, were regarded as extreme by ministers. But many analysts now believe closing the borders was an important precaution that helped these countries and others fare much better. Johnson announced a full-blown lockdown on 23 March last year, with little idea at the time that it would remain in place until July, with many children kept out of the classroom until September. He had edged towards the shutdown via a series of intermediate steps, including banning mass public events and exhorting the public to avoid unnecessary social interaction and to work from home where possible. Only when modelling carried out by Prof Neil Ferguson at Imperial College London suggested there could be up to 500,000 deaths if the virus was not brought under control, and amid growing signs that the public were taking matters into their own hands, did Johnson order the public to stay at home. Some public health experts now believe an earlier shutdown could have saved many thousands of lives. When it emerged that his top adviser had flouted lockdown rules by driving 300-plus miles to Durham, with a day trip to a local town thrown in, Johnson stuck by him resolutely. He told the public at a Downing Street press conference that his aide had acted "responsibly and legally", in crisscrossing the country, ostensibly to seek childcare for his young son, and then to test his eyesight, at a time when the public were being urged to stay at home. His decision sparked an avalanche of angry emails to MPs and risked undermining public confidence in lockdown rules at a critical time. The former TalkTalk executive Dido Harding was brought in by Johnson and Matt Hancock to run the hugely costly test-and-trace system, which has relied heavily on private sector outsourcing and has not worked as effectively as hoped. Councils carrying out their own local contact-tracing operations have generally obtained better results than the call centres run by Serco and other providers, while management consultants have in some cases been paid £7,000 a day for their expertise in setting it up. Johnson and his chancellor, Rishi Sunak, have declined to fix holes in the social safety net – including the paucity of statutory sick pay – that have created a strong financial disincentive for many people to self-isolate. Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance gave the prime minister a briefing on 16 September setting out the dire risks of allowing the virus to run unchecked as cases increased into the autumn. Their colleagues on the Sage committee suggested a short "circuit-breaker" lockdown, perhaps over the October half-term. But Downing Street aides made clear at the time that Johnson considered it to be his role to weigh up scientific advice with other considerations, including the economic and social costs of a fresh lockdown. He therefore opted for a middle course, between the scientists' proposal and the demands of many in his party to resist fresh restrictions: a beefed-up system of "tiers", with tougher rules for the hardest-hit areas. In the event, as Whitty predicted when they were introduced, even the strictest, tier 3 rules did not do enough to restrain the virus, and a month-long lockdown was announced on 31 October. A month before Christmas, the government agreed a plan with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland administrations that would allow up to three households to mix for a fixed five days over the festive period. Johnson then stuck resolutely by the plan, even as cases surged in London and Kent. Matt Hancock alerted the House of Commons to concerns about a new variant of the virus on 14 December,

====================
<|startofarticle|>  Jeremy Corbyn will be granted a pass to Labour's conference in Brighton later this month and will be free to address fringe meetings despite currently sitting as an independent MP, a party spokesperson has said. The former leader, who had the whip suspended by Keir Starmer last year, has applied for a conference pass and accepted invitations to speak at several events, the Guardian understands.  Amid a growing row about whether Corbyn should be allowed to attend, a spokesperson said: "He's definitely not barred: of course he will be getting a conference pass." The last time Corbyn attended Labour conference in 2019 – also in Brighton – it was as party leader, when the event was curtailed after the supreme court struck down Boris Johnson's prorogation of parliament. Three months later, the party plunged to its worst electoral defeat since 1935. Starmer's team had faced a mounting backlash after the chair of Young Labour, Jess Barnard, complained she had been told Corbyn would not be allowed to speak at the group's conference event. Labour sources said the Young Labour event was a formal part of Labour conference, and as such the speakers would have to be vetted separately. But they confirmed Corbyn would be allowed to speak at fringe meetings in the conference centre, which do not form part of Labour's formal programme or take place on the main conference stage. Corbyn supporters had warned that rejecting his conference application would be a provocation by Starmer. "He is a Labour member: he should be entitled to attend any meeting in the conference zone," said Richard Burgon, the Leeds East MP who chairs the Socialist Campaign Group of leftwing MPs. "If the leadership decided to bar him from the conference, they would be doing so as a provocative act towards the membership, hoping that more leftwing members leave," he added. Corbyn will also be free to address events at the World Transformed event, which is taking place outside the formal conference zone. One senior party aide said the leadership had faced a "lose-lose" decision about whether to admit him to the main conference venue, raising the spectre of Boris Johnson's packed-out speech at Tory conference in 2018 during Theresa May's premiership. Corbyn had his membership of Labour restored last November by the party's ruling national executive committee (NEC), but Starmer has declined to restore the whip, meaning Corbyn now sits as an independent. Starmer told the Guardian last month that in order to be welcomed back into the fold, Corbyn would have to apologise for, and take down, comments made in the aftermath of the publication of the damning Equality and Human Rights Commission report on Labour's handling of antisemitism complaints. In a statement that remains online, Corbyn claimed the scale of antisemitism in Labour was "dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party". Starmer's team hope the first in-person conference since he was elected leader will be a showcase for Labour's values and policies. But a row had already erupted about Young Labour day, which was meant to form part of the usual conference schedule. Barnard has complained that Young Labour has not been given the support from the party's general secretary, David Evans, that it needed to hold an event, and was told it would not be allowed to have Corbyn as a speaker. The NEC recently agreed to proscribe four leftwing groups. Some MPs claim Starmer is carrying out a purge of Corbyn-supporting elements of the party, though the leadership say they are simply following through on their determination to root out antisemitism.

====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, has said her own experience as a care worker helped to convince her more flexible working could be a "win-win" for staff and employers. Speaking to the Guardian after announcing new policies last week on employment rights and flexible conditions, Rayner said she had helped negotiate family-friendly working when she was a trade union representative.  "We were frontline manual workers, delivering 7am till 10pm care in people's homes. We introduced a flexible rota that worked for the staff, and we saw productivity go up. The wellbeing of the staff, as well as the outcome for the service user, was they had the same staff going in – and sickness levels went significantly down as well, so it saved money for the employer. It's a win-win," she said. "Of course, not everything can be achieved in every single workplace, but there are flexible options I believe in every workplace. If an employer looks after the employees, the employees will look after the employer, and it's reciprocal," she added. Rayner announced this week that a Labour government would legislate to give companies an obligation to provide flexible conditions – including compressed hours, and accommodating caring responsibilities such as the school run – unless they can show it is unworkable. It was part of a package of measures, drawn up with the shadow workers' rights minister, Andy McDonald, that also included ensuring all employees gain rights from day one in a job. The plans have been welcomed by the Corbynite campaign group Momentum, and helped to assuage fears among some in the party that Starmer would ditch the radical 2019 manifesto wholesale. Speaking after a visit to a flexible working hub in Hull, Rayner said Labour's aim was nothing less than to achieve a "cultural shift" in the workplace. "It's about changing the culture in our country. The whole emphasis to me is, yes there's individual nuggets in here, but it's about a cultural shift away from people being inflexible, and not looking for new and fresh ideas about how people can engage in the workplace," she said. Rayner shrugged off suggestions that she has been at loggerheads with Keir Starmer – or could even challenge him for the leadership, as some supporters had urged her to do before the Batley and Spen byelection earlier this month. "Me and Keir have been working incredibly closely together since the start of the pandemic," she said, comparing the day when they were both elected in the depths of the first lockdown to "an arranged marriage, almost, by telephone". "We bring different things to that leadership. And I think that works," she said, calling them "yin and yang". Labour's loss of the Hartlepool constituency in May sparked panic about Starmer's prospects of leading Labour to a general election victory, with some MPs quietly casting around for a candidate who could gather the 40 signatures necessary to mount a challenge. But his leadership has appeared more secure since the party held the Yorkshire seat of Batley and Spen. Rayner said she and Starmer had different approaches. "You know, my style is more robust as people know: I'm more bombastic, in the way in which do things, I say it how I see it: and therefore I bring that freshness to the partnership." "Keir's very forensic, he's very intelligent. He's very passionate about making sure that the country is a better place," she said. Rayner has spoken in the past about growing up in poverty, and becoming a carer for her mother, who struggled with mental illness, from the age of 10. "I like to think I overshare and Keir undershares," she said. "If you look at Keir's background, it's not dissimilar for mine: he looked after his mum, I looked after my mum," she says. "Keir wasn't from a privileged background". Challenged about a dip in Labour's membership, Rayner said she was focused on voters. "Of course we want to attract people to be members of the Labour party, but what we need to do is we need to attract voters as well. And what we're doing is we're speaking to the country: we're saying that actually we don't want to be an opposition, we want to be a government," she said. Labour is in the process of laying off up to 90 staff via voluntary redundancies, as Starmer seeks to repair the party's shattered finances after costly election battles and a string of legal cases. The former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott criticised Labour this week for simultaneously seeking to hire staff on six-month contracts to handle a backlog of complaints against members. "So Keir will make Britain the best place to work – unless you work for Labour," Abbott tweeted. Rayner rejected that, highlighting the importance of ensuring the party is financially viable. "We don't want to be making staff redundant. It's an awful situation but

<|startofarticle|>  Keir Starmer has appointed well-respected north-east of England MP Sharon Hodgson as his new parliamentary aide, as he seeks to smooth relations with Labour backbenchers after last weekend's fraught reshuffle. Hodgson, the MP for Washington and Sunderland West since 2010, replaces Carolyn Harris, who resigned earlier this week amid claims that she had stoked up tensions between Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner.  As Starmer's parliamentary private secretary, her job will be to liaise between backbenchers and the leader's office. Some MPs have complained in recent weeks that they felt neglected by Starmer's team. Hodgson will also bring understanding of the north-east, where Labour lost the Hartlepool byelection last week, and the Conservatives made fresh inroads in local council elections. Labour announced several other junior appointments on Friday evening, as the Labour leader completed the shakeup that began in the wake of last week's election results. Peter Kyle, the Hove MP, will be the shadow schools minister, after Wes Streeting was handed a new role overseeing Labour's child poverty strategy. Streeting announced on Friday that he will step back from frontline politics for the time being after being diagnosed with kidney cancer. The leftwinger Andy McDonald will have a beefed-up role in Rayner's new team, as shadow secretary of state for employment rights and protections. Seema Malhotra will be shadow business and consumer minister, replacing Lucy Powell, who was promoted last week to be shadow housing secretary.

<|startofarticle|>  Boris Johnson has said "we truly did everything we could" to minimise loss of life from coronavirus, and insisted he takes "full responsibility" for the government's handling of the pandemic. Speaking to journalists en route to an announcement at the cabinet meeting on Wednesday, the prime minister said he wanted to make clear at the party's conference in Brighton that the government would do everything in its power to tackle the virus.  "We are: we're perfectly capable of handling this crisis on a rapid and radicalised basis, because we've taken full responsibility," he said. Johnson said he wanted to make clear at the party's conference in Brighton that the government would do everything in its power to contain the virus. "We've taken full responsibility. We're going to Downing Street," he said. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, who was taken on by the government on a week-long visit, said the work in India was "akin to a military operation". He said the prime minister hoped to show that "Indonesia and not Pakistan has no future as a trading post".
====================
<|startofarticle|>   Legislation to reorganise the NHS will "institutionalise cronyism", and could lead to funding cuts of more than £200 a patient in the most deprived areas of England, Labour has claimed. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, will bring the controversial health and care bill back to the House of Commons on Wednesday for its second reading, which Labour will oppose.  The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, told the Guardian it was "the wrong bill at the wrong time". "The Conservatives are embarking on a top-down reorganisation when we are still in a pandemic, when admissions are rising, and we are going steeply up the trajectory to 100,000 infections a day; when you've got hospitals in Birmingham and Leeds saying they've got to cancel cancer surgery because of the pressures they are under; when the waiting list has topped 5.3 million, so big you can see it from outer space," Ashworth said. Under the complex reforms, more than 200 clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) will be replaced by just 42 much larger integrated care systems. The government has not yet given details of how funding will be allocated to these new commissioning units but Labour analysis suggests that if existing budgets are spread evenly across the new regions, deprived areas could suffer significant cuts. Blackpool could lose out by £287 a patient by being integrated into the much wider Lancashire and South Cumbria region, for example; Knowsley by £253 a patient as it joins Cheshire and Merseyside; and Salford by £116 a patient as it is swallowed up into the Greater Manchester health and care partnership. Several Conservative MPs, including former prime minister Theresa May and liaison committee chair Bernard Jenkin, have already raised questions about the impact of the reorganisation on their local areas. "There are deep concerns about what this bill means for patient care," Ashworth said. "I do not believe it will improve patient care. I don't believe it will integrate care: quite the opposite." Ashworth also warned that the legislation as drafted does not reserve an automatic place on the new ICS boards for patient representatives, or for mental health providers – though they can be invited to join. "Once again, we have another reorganisation – and we've had 20 in the last 30 years – where patients are sort of left as like a ghost in the machine: they're not thought about, and their interests are not brought to the fore at all," he said. And Labour claims the new powers the health secretary will take on as part of the shake-up could allow him to award lucrative outsourcing contracts to private companies. "You don't want the secretary of state given the power whereby they can hand out contracts to the private sector with no accountability, no transparency whatsover," Ashworth said. "We are concerned that there are elements of this bill that are a privatisers' charter, and we'll be seeking to get those elements taken out of the bill." There is nothing in the legislation to prevent private healthcare providers sitting on an ICS, he claimed. That is already happening in Bath and North East Somerset, where Virgin Care, which delivers some local services, has a seat on the shadow ICS established to prepare for the shake-up. The legislation would also scrap section 75 of the Health and Social Care Act 2012, which made it mandatory for all NHS contracts to be put out to competitive tender. Citing multiple claims of cronyism during the pandemic, including former health secretary Matt Hancock's local pub landlord receiving a contract to manufacture PPE, Ashworth said: "What this bill is about to do is to institutionalise that cronyism." The shake-up was the brainchild of Hancock, who said it built on the lessons learned during the pandemic. When Javid introduced the legislation to parliament last week, he said it would make the NHS "less bureaucratic, more accountable, and more integrated in the wake of Covid-19". He added that it would allow "closer collaboration between the NHS, local authorities and care providers to provide more joined-up working". Some reports have suggested Javid was sceptical about the need for pressing ahead with the legislation, but the prime minister had insisted on it. Ashworth also reiterated his criticism of the government's decision to lift almost all Covid restrictions on 19 July, calling for mask-wearing to remain mandatory, and improved ventilation to be installed in public buildings.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  "Reshuffle" seemed an understatement, given the radical scope of the shake-up Keir Starmer carried out among Labour's top ranks on Monday, with few posts left untouched. Starmer's aides saw it as completing the work begun in May's botched overhaul, which saw Anneliese Dodds replaced by Rachel Reeves as shadow chancellor; but was derailed by Angela Rayner, who resisted a move for herself.  Changes for both Jon Ashworth and Lisa Nandy were mooted at the time, and have now been acted on. And this time around, Starmer publicly asserted his authority over Rayner – with whom relations have continued to be scratchy – by kicking off the reshuffle as she was delivering a major speech in Westminster on cleaning up public life. She was briefly informed that a shake-up was under way; but not consulted (though Jeremy Corbyn certainly didn't consult his deputy, Tom Watson, on the makeup of his shadow team either). The end result marked a shift to the political right, and created a powerful platform for rising stars Wes Streeting and Bridget Phillipson, both viewed as effective media performers. Shadow cabinet ministers had recently complained about how much airtime Streeting was getting, despite holding the relatively junior post of shadow schools minister. As shadow health secretary in the midst of a pandemic, he will now be a key spokesperson and public face of a potential future Labour government. One Labour insider suggested there had been little effort to match people to their expertise – citing Steve Reed's move to shadow justice, for example – and an overwhelming focus on who can deliver a punchy media performance. More low-key shadow ministers, including Kate Green at education and Luke Pollard at environment, both of whom were viewed by colleagues as diligent and thoughtful, were unceremoniously ditched. Tellingly, one Starmer aide told the Politico newsletter – a daily note for Westminster insiders – that the reshuffle had put, "fresh hungry effective message-carriers in key briefs". His team are ruthlessly pursuing the aim of winning over swing voters in a handful of key seats, many of them in the "red wall", and want people in place who are reassuring to Conservative-Labour switchers, not redolent of Corbyn. They believe they are succeeding for the first time in a long time in having a leader voters can imagine as prime minister; and are delighted by the performance of Reeves, including, recently, a highly positive profile in the Telegraph; but they now want to build on that by creating a wider team the public can imagine as a government. To that end, the overhaul also saw the return of Labour "big beast" Yvette Cooper, one of a relatively small number of sitting MPs – with Ed Miliband and Hilary Benn – who have been cabinet ministers. Starmer appeared to avoid such tall poppies in his first frontbench team, instead promoting Nick Thomas-Symonds and Dodds, both intellectuals with deep expertise, but without their own powerbases in the party. One longtime Labour insider remarked that both Cooper and Miliband are "more experienced politicians than Keir," suggesting that by moving Miliband sideways and bringing Cooper into the tent, he must now feel his own position is more secure. So for Starmer's team, the reshuffle was an assertion of his authority, which had been battered by the ham-fisted reshuffle back in May; and a signal of intent to voters, with a general election potentially just a couple of years away. For MPs on Labour's soft left, who had previously regarded Starmer as one of their own, the end result was a sense of gnawing disquiet about a continued drift to the right, however. And some warned that the relentless focus on target voters in the red wall, while understandable given the shape of 2019's crushing defeat, risked alienating other groups Labour may need if it is ultimately to succeed in forming the next government.

<|startofarticle|>  Vaccine passports will be compulsory to enter packed venues such as nightclubs in an extraordinary U-turn announced by Boris Johnson hours after clubs were allowed to open for the first time in 16 months. In a move that provoked an immediate backlash from Conservative backbenchers and the entertainment sector, the prime minister said that from late September, once all adults have had the chance to receive two jabs, Covid vaccine certificates would be made mandatory in England.  "I should serve notice now that by the end of September, when all over-18s will have had their chance to be double-jabbed, we are planning to make full vaccination the condition of entry to nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather," he said. Unlike at pilot events, where customers have been allowed to show evidence of a negative test, they will have to prove they have been double-jabbed amid concerns in government about vaccine uptake among young people. Approximately 35% of 18- to 30-year-olds are unvaccinated, he said. Addressing younger people directly, Johnson said: "Some of life's most important pleasures and opportunities are likely to be increasingly dependent on vaccination." Less than 18 hours after almost all Covid restrictions were formally scrapped, allowing clubs to open and putting an end to mandatory masks and social distancing, the prime minister expressed concern about what he called the "continuing risk posed by nightclubs". From just after midnight on Sunday, thousands of revellers were pictured dancing at clubs across the country as they celebrated "freedom day". Johnson was delivering a press conference from Chequers, where he is self-isolating after contact with the health secretary, Sajid Javid, who has tested positive for Covid. The prime minister spoke alongside England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, and the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, both of whom struck a sombre tone about the challenges ahead. Vallance said hospitalisations could rise "quite a lot higher" than 1,000 a day as the lifting of restrictions allows more socialising, while Van-Tam repeatedly underlined the risks of unvaccinated people gathering in crowded indoor venues. Asked what would happen if the NHS struggles to cope over the summer, Van-Tam said the Scientific Advisory Committee on Emergencies (Sage) would have to make recommendations, which could focus on "close contact indoors". As ministers scramble to manage the fallout from surging Covid cases, Johnson also announced that "a very small number of named, fully vaccinated, critical workers" would be allowed to return to work after being ordered to self-isolate. These workers, in sectors such as the police, energy supply, food production and transport, will be allowed to leave quarantine, solely to work, if they take a negative PCR test and continue to have daily rapid tests. Their employer will have to consult with the relevant government department before allowing them to return. Conservative backbenchers were quick to criticise the new plans to make vaccine certificates compulsory for some venues. Former Brexit secretary David Davis said: "Vaccination is sensible. But it is entirely wrong to try to coerce people into having them." Mark Harper, a Tory MP and former chief whip who leads the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group, suggested the government could struggle to win support for the measures among other Conservatives in parliament. He said: "I have not been surprised by the government's position. We are a government with a very attractive argument: it argues for itself and its interests, and it gets away with it so often." But he conceded that the government's reputation was "not great" during the pandemic, and that its careful planning during the pandemic had led to few concrete measures.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Rutger Thaouyan, the deputy leader of the Green party, said the government's "plan B" measures, aimed at cutting NHS waiting lists in the early months of the pandemic, had made it impossible to screen for Covid. "The pandemic has completely taken hold and people are having to self-isolate. It's like the back of a shopping trolley: you can't just throw it at people, they're going to go and get it themselves," Thaouyan said, adding: "It's much harder to screen for an illness lasting months, if not years, and it's much harder to screen for when you've got a flu-like virus that lives in the blood". The prime minister described the pandemic as "unavoidable", with "140 days of zero restrictions" due to appear on the new targeted list of restrictions. But he insisted that England remained "locked on to the idea that somehow getting into lockdown is somehow more important than preventing future outbreaks". He said the government's justification for not imposing any new restrictions at the same time as existing ones was simple. "One of the frustrating aspects of the Conservatives' approach is that they have opted for a series of attempts at persuasion, namely, the threat of tax increases, which is obviously unsustainable. And also the fact that after the last serious attack on the NHS in the autumn and winter, 2015, there are still people in the UK with very poor health, who are still counting on the NHS to provide them with care," he said. "And finally, it's the fact that they have got away with it so much more recently, because they thought they could use more of the taxpayer's money, which they have done by cutting the NHS budget. It has created a huge financial disincentive to do the things that the Conservatives have – cutting NHS funding, for example."

After a spat with backbench colleague Angela Rayner over the direction of Starmer's new frontbench office, Rayner resigned rather than be moved into a more senior role. Hodgson was Starmer's deputy chief of staff until May, when he was moved aside to be Labour's new shadow home secretary.  During the same period, Starmer's team spent much of the past fortnight highlighting the significant cuts to the tax-cutting powers of the business secretary, Sajid Javid, and the announcement of a new £28bn-a-year "levelling-up" fund. While the cuts are significant, they were not enough to convince the Labour leader to run for election. Instead, Starmer's team will want to highlight his ability to deliver on a promise to voters, and his ability to deliver on a broader political mission: of "levelling up" the UK.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour's performance on Thursday was broadly positive – the party passed the "big six" the health and social care bill, resulting in a significant reduction in the deficit. However, the government's implementation of the legislation has been hampered by political infighting and significant backbench rebellion. Javid has struggled to get his party into the red wall, with the Conservatives frequently lambasting his handling of the pandemic – including on Sunday Night Football. The party is now hoping to polish its own image, with the uniform white coat and colourful hoodies giving way to colourful, hooded-bearded options. The deputy Labour leader, Angela Rayner, will help her MPs through the tough week ahead with a parting message to the nation: "You've been warned." The shadow cabinet office minister, Anneliese Dodds, who was a friend of Jo Cox, said: "The spectacle of empty shelves and shuttered petrol stations sends shock waves through the parliamentary party. "As a government, we knew that this was a difficult and challenging period and we would not want to encourage or support behaviour that is either unlawful or supports a particular party." Johnson loyalists on the backbenches have also expressed concerns about the plan to relaunch the government's plan A into mass softening, which was narrowly passed by MPs on Sunday. They would like the next stage of the roadmap to be more gradual, allowing for the introduction of new drugs and a reworked economy. Dodds said Johnson's insistence that "mass activations be rare" was "like the empty shelves that keeps going the extra £250m". Johnson's spokesperson said the prime minister did not agree with the view expressed by Rayner: "Boris is consistent that the data shows that the public support the effort to roll out the national insurance plan." He added: "The data also shows that the public support the effort to roll out the social care cap as a way of boosting people's opportunities." Asked why the government had not already moved to make it easier for businesses to get the support they need, he said: "We're setting out the plan now. You can see it on the ground, the businesses are saying they're going to be the first to be flooded." The prime minister and the health secretary have been ringing round potential allies in the health and science departments as they bid to secure the final say over how the new vaccine will be rolled out. Johnson has declined to sack Matt Hancock, Ben Wallace or equally the NHS and care minister, who were placed under a series of difficult choices over the summer. When the 2017 manifesto was published in July, Johnson claimed the final say over the policy was up to the individual health secretary. But the Whitehall operation has been dogged in recent months by internal criticism that the structure of the overhaul had not been updated enough during the long pandemic.
====================
<|startofarticle|>    Labour's performance in the key 2019 elections was, ironically, hampered by the catastrophic nature of the pandemic. Winning Hartlepool in May cemented hopes in government that after smashing the "red wall" in the 2019 general election, there may be more gains to be made in the north-east and other Labour-held areas in a future national vote. However, the next general election will be much more difficult, with the "big six" of Johnson, May and Tanya Slughany, notable among others, all guilty of paying out of reach of strict financial-supporting rules. The Conservatives were already guilty until found not to have broken the rules, when voters are entitled to a glimpse at the leaders' palatial villa. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, responding to Johnson, claimed many of the problems in the NHS and care system had existed before the pandemic and accused him of "putting a sticking plaster over a gaping wound". The decision to break an explicit manifesto promise has sparked a backlash among Tory MPs, while Labour has pointed out the impact of NIC increases would be borne by younger, low-income workers. Johnson believes voters will accept the tax increase because of the backdrop of the pandemic. The government was keen to stress that the national insurance increase was progressive, hitting higher earners harder, and with more than 6 million of the lowest earners exempt. The decision to charge the levy to working people of pension age is aimed at addressing the perception that older people will not be paying their share. Conservative MPs could be asked to vote on the proposals as soon as this week, with the government keen to resolve it before the Commons breaks for the annual party conferences in a fortnight.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Keir Starmer has appointed well-respected north-east of England MP Sharon Hodgson as his new parliamentary aide, as he seeks to smooth relations with Labour backbenchers after last weekend's fraught reshuffle. Hodgson, the MP for Washington and Sunderland West since 2010, replaces Carolyn Harris, who resigned earlier this week amid claims that she had stoked up tensions between Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner.  As Starmer's parliamentary private secretary, her job will be to liaise between backbenchers and the leader's office. Some MPs have complained in recent weeks that they felt neglected by Starmer's team. Hodgson will also bring understanding of the north-east, where Labour lost the Hartlepool byelection last week, and the Conservatives made fresh inroads in local council elections. Labour announced several other junior appointments on Friday evening, as the Labour leader completed the shakeup that began in the wake of last week's election results. Peter Kyle, the Hove MP, will be the shadow schools minister, after Wes Streeting was handed a new role overseeing Labour's child poverty strategy. Streeting announced on Friday that he will step back from frontline politics for the time being after being diagnosed with kidney cancer. The leftwinger Andy McDonald will have a beefed-up role in Rayner's new team, as shadow secretary of state for employment rights and protections. Seema Malhotra will be shadow business and consumer minister, replacing Lucy Powell, who was promoted last week to be shadow housing secretary. Other changes include a return to the fold for several MPs who had resigned for various reasons. Flo Eshalomi, MP for Vauxhall, who resigned rather than vote for Boris Johnson's Brexit in December, returns as Rayner's new parliamentary private secretary. Olivia Blake, the MP for Sheffield Hallam, who stepped down over Labour's stance on the overseas operations bill, returns as shadow minister for nature. Starmer's plans for overhauling his frontbench last weekend were held up for much of last Sunday by negotiations with Rayner about what role she would be willing to accept. She relinquished the jobs of party chair and national campaign coordinator, and was instead handed the role of shadowing the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, as well as other titles, including shadow secretary of state for the future of work.

<|startofarticle|>  Jeremy Corbyn has pledged to campaign against the arrival of Rupert Murdoch's News UK television channel as he launched his Peace and Justice Project at an online rally. A more "just, free and accountable" media is one of four causes Corbyn is encouraging his supporters to back. He also urged them to help with organising direct support in communities, such as food banks; campaign for a green new deal; and press the government to speed up the delivery of Covid vaccines in developing countries.  "So many of the ideas we need to make the 2020s better than the 2010s were developed in and around the Labour party in recent years, by outstanding thinkers, but more importantly by demands of our movements, and the skills, knowledge and needs of the communities affected," Corbyn said. "We will build on these policies, taking them further, adapting them to the post-pandemic world, so that our movement can turn the dial towards peace and justice." Corbyn was readmitted to the Labour party in November, after being suspended over remarks he made when the Equality and Human Rights Commission published its critical report on the party's handling of antisemitism. But his successor as leader, Keir Starmer, declined to restore the Labour whip to Corbyn, who now sits as an independent MP. The broadcasting regulator, Ofcom, gave the go-ahead last month to Murdoch's right-leaning news channel, which is expected to be on air for four to five hours a night. It is expected to compete with Andrew Neil's GB News, with the pair racing to be the first on air. Corbyn repeatedly criticised the role of the media in public life during his time as leader of the opposition. He was ridiculed in some of Murdoch's newspapers, with the Sun's front page on election day in 2017 urging its readers: "Don't chuck Britain in the Cor-bin." Corbyn gave a lecture at the Edinburgh television festival in 2018 calling for a taxpayer-owned British Digital Corporation to offset the power of multinational corporations in the media, though the policy never found its way into Labour's manifesto. His digital rally also featured Greece's former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis and the Labour MP for Coventry South, Zarah Sultana. The new initiative will not be signing up members but Corbyn hopes to play a convening role in bringing together activists, trade unions and other leftwing groups. Setting out the aims of his new political venture, he appeared to take a sideswipe at his successor, saying: "If you refuse to argue for your side, our opponents win by default." Some of Corbyn's allies believe Starmer has not been sufficiently robust in attacking Boris Johnson's government – and fear backsliding from some of the radical policies set out in the 2019 general election manifesto. Starmer has adopted the slogan "a new leadership" to differentiate his tenure from Corbyn's four-and-a-half-year period at the top of the party.
====================
<|startofarticle|> Updated at 10.15pm with the latest information as the government prepares to make NHS Covid certificates compulsory for care homes. They are a key element of the government's roadmap to reopening, but the prime minister has said he would be willing to go ahead with them if they are "adequately implemented".  In a sign of the seriousness with which the situation is now, on Saturday Johnson conceded that it was "business as usual" in the run-up to Christmas.  Asked repeatedly if he was "hopeless," he said: "It's the economy. It is the whole country. I think we should be very cautious about setting out the plan here because we're just trying to get across to people what we are a really great country and we're going to keep going." He added: "We're just trying to get across to people what we are a really great country and we're going to keep going." Relatives' groups have been campaigning for families to come forward and speak to their loved ones about the loss of their loved ones in the Covid pandemic. Johnson was cheered by his own MPs at the start of his appearance, after a turbulent three-week period that included several backbench rebellions and some senior Tories expressing concern about his grip on government.  He was briefly informed that the health secretary, Sajid Javid, will attend a three-day visit on Monday, but the prime minister has decided not to extend it beyond a later stage of the crisis. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said he could not say the government was "fulfilled" plans, but he was clear that would not be cancelling the Christmas mix-up. "I'm sure that's something people in Hartlepool and Bucharest will recall that during the lockdown, we had people from all over the world speaking to one another, and we knew that going in was going to be difficult. "But it is, and we will be hoping for things to get out of control before the worst comes along." He said the G7 summit would be "a good place to start the year" after the complex arrangement allowing the UK to hold several open meetings at the summit hotel. But he insisted the summit would be a "testing ground" for the virus, and there was only a 60% chance the virus would get better before it got into lockdown. He was speaking as he visited a vaccine centre in London, where the prime minister said he had been reassured by the prime minister that the government's aim is to get the virus under control by the end of January.  He welcomed the government's decision to make it a qualifying criteria event for the next stage of easing, but said it was time to think about "the broader story" of the pandemic. "We've gone through a whole series of things before this pandemic, and it's only a matter of time before we see the whole picture come together," he said. The prime minister had previously been sceptical about publicising the health outcomes of the pandemic, with the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt describing it as a "blingxisting story". The current narrative, with its skewed approach and picture of a rapidly deteriorating health system, has involved the well-liked but undressed Barack Obama receiving the Medal of Freedom. Much of the media attention has been focused on the US, where President Joe Biden has been openly asserting his authority over the crisis-struck EU, with the apparent aim of whipping the public to support his agenda. The UK has repeatedly failed to make public the data about the daily uses of the bioreactors used to produce the vaccines, and the EU appears unlikely to sign up to the EU's new "tilt-plan" vaccines, which use inductive reasoning to judge whether a substance is safe to swallow. The EU's management of the bioreactor issue has also had the opposite effect of effect, with the same number of units passing each other between different doses of the same drug. Johnson's official spokesperson has insisted the UK is still in the business of exchanging goods; but transport secretary Grant Shapps has stressed the technicalities of the business of transport exchange. Chris Whitty has stressed the importance of ensuring the UK remains within the rules of the European Union. Shapps has been keen to emphasise the economic benefits of the reopening of the link between the US and Europe, as the US prepares to join the ambitious agenda of overhauling the Nato alliance to reflect the security alliance. The announcement earlier this week that the UK will contribute up to $100bn to the UN's climate fund brought the economic benefits of the link up to date. Shapps' announcement was cheered at the Downing Street press conference by the announcement that it will be the UK's first international deal announced on Tuesday, after the Cop26 summit. The green international agreement was negotiated by the historic climate summit and attended by Donald Trump, Joe Biden and Alok Sharma, making it the most important climate summit in the world between the leaders

====================
<|startofarticle|>  Boris Johnson has said "we truly did everything we could" to minimise loss of life from coronavirus, and insisted he takes "full responsibility" for the government's handling of the pandemic. Speaking to journalists en route to an announcement at the Eden Project on Wednesday, the prime minister said he wanted to make clear at the weekend that the UK was "not remotely a corrupt country".  He cited the failings of the "cronybroker" who was brought in to oversee the scheme, and the fact that the "50-state plan" included a requirement for drug companies to "pay whatever they can" for the use of British law. Johnson was speaking as he arrived in Washington by train from New York at the start of a three-day visit to the Northern Research and Policy Centre, a libertarian thinktank. The prime minister was speaking in the aftermath of a slew of disappointing election results, including in Scotland, where the Conservatives took just one seat. Johnson was speaking earlier this week as he set out a series of high-profile policy developments as the Labour leader, promising a Labour government will "never again go into an election with a manifesto that is not a serious plan for government." He highlighted what he claimed would be the UK's newfound ability to "set our own standards, to innovate in the way that we want" in key sectors such as biosciences and artificial intelligence. "British laws will be made solely by the British parliament; interpreted by British judges, sitting in the UK courts," he said. Johnson also stressed the "prodigious" increase in fishing catches he said the UK would now be allowed to keep. Despite the fact exporters will now face increased friction at the border, he claimed he had struck "a deal which will if anything allow our companies and our exporters to do even more business with our European friends". His optimism contrasts with the expectations of the government's own independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, which expects Brexit to shave 4% off GDP in the medium term. The fishing industry was also disappointed that Johnson had not secured control of the 12 miles of fishing waters off the coast of Britain. Barrie Deas, head of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, said: "I think what I would say is that there's a gap between the rhetoric and the delivery … I think the industry will be bitterly disappointed. I think there will be fury about the failure to secure an exclusive 12-mile zone." Most of Johnson's themes in his speech, including sovereignty, regulatory independence and fishing, were those close to the hearts of the Brexit-backing MPs who helped him to win the Tory leadership last year. With MPs set to vote on the agreement on Wednesday 30 December, Downing Street has kept Eurosceptic backbenchers closely informed as negotiations developed. After the deal was struck, many said they would await the verdict of a "star chamber" of experts convened by the backbench European Research Group to go through the agreement line by line. The group, consisting of lawyers and politicians including the former Europe minister David Jones, is not expected to publish its conclusions until Monday. The prime minister urged Brexiters and remainers to move on from the divisions that have plagued UK politics since the referendum. "My message to everybody on both sides of that argument in 2016 is I really think now it's a long time behind us," he said. He claimed the UK would remain "culturally, emotionally, historically, strategically and geologically attached to Europe, not least through the 4 million EU nationals who have requested to settle in the UK over the last four years and who make an enormous contribution to our country and to our lives".
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Boris Johnson has said "we truly did everything we could" to minimise loss of life from coronavirus, and insisted he takes "full responsibility" for the government's handling of the pandemic. But when an inquiry is eventually carried out into the past 12 torrid months, the prime minister will have to face a series of difficult questions about key decisions he made.  As news first began to trickle out of China, triggering the government's pandemic planning, the prime minister left the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to chair the first five meetings of the emergency Cobra committee about the virus. After carrying out a fraught reshuffle of his cabinet, Johnson decamped to the taxpayer-owned mansion of Chevening, and did not chair his first Covid Cobra meeting until 2 March, just before the first confirmed UK death from the virus. Comforted by advisers who compared the challenge to tackling seasonal flu, he tended to play down the seriousness of the pandemic in its early days, insisting it was "business as usual". Most memorably, he told a Downing Street briefing that he "shook hands with everybody" during a hospital visit in early March. With the support of scientific advisers, Johnson took the decision to lift border restrictions on 13 March last year after evidence emerged that the virus was already circulating in the UK, despite a strict quarantine regime for arrivals from Wuhan, in China. At the time, the harsher approach adopted early on by countries such as Singapore and New Zealand, involving flight bans and quarantine, were regarded as extreme by ministers. But many analysts now believe closing the borders was an important precaution that helped these countries and others fare much better. Johnson announced a full-blown lockdown on 23 March last year, with little idea at the time that it would remain in place until July, with many children kept out of the classroom until September. He had edged towards the shutdown via a series of intermediate steps, including banning mass public events and exhorting the public to avoid unnecessary social interaction and to work from home where possible. Only when modelling carried out by Prof Neil Ferguson at Imperial College London suggested there could be up to 500,000 deaths if the virus was not brought under control, and amid growing signs that the public were taking matters into their own hands, did Johnson order the public to stay at home. Some public health experts now believe an earlier shutdown could have saved many thousands of lives. When it emerged that his top adviser had flouted lockdown rules by driving 300-plus miles to Durham, with a day trip to a local town thrown in, Johnson stuck by him resolutely. He told the public at a Downing Street press conference that his aide had acted "responsibly and legally", in crisscrossing the country, ostensibly to seek childcare for his young son, and then to test his eyesight, at a time when the public were being urged to stay at home. His decision sparked an avalanche of angry emails to MPs and risked undermining public confidence in lockdown rules at a critical time. The former TalkTalk executive Dido Harding was brought in by Johnson and Matt Hancock to run the hugely costly test-and-trace system, which has relied heavily on private sector outsourcing and has not worked as effectively as hoped. Councils carrying out their own local contact-tracing operations have generally obtained better results than the call centres run by Serco and other providers, while management consultants have in some cases been paid £7,000 a day for their expertise in setting it up. Johnson and his chancellor, Rishi Sunak, have declined to fix holes in the social safety net – including the paucity of statutory sick pay – that have created a strong financial disincentive for many people to self-isolate. Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance gave the prime minister a briefing on 16 September setting out the dire risks of allowing the virus to run unchecked as cases increased into the autumn. Their colleagues on the Sage committee suggested a short "circuit-breaker" lockdown, perhaps over the October half-term. But Downing Street aides made clear at the time that Johnson considered it to be his role to weigh up scientific advice with other considerations, including the economic and social costs of a fresh lockdown. He therefore opted for a middle course, between the scientists' proposal and the demands of many in his party to resist fresh restrictions: a beefed-up system of "tiers", with tougher rules for the hardest-hit areas. In the event, as Whitty predicted when they were introduced, even the strictest, tier 3 rules did not do enough to restrain the virus, and a month-long lockdown was announced on 31 October. A month before Christmas, the government agreed a plan with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland administrations that would allow up to three households to mix for a fixed five days over the festive period. Johnson then stuck resolutely by the plan, even as cases surged in London and Kent. Matt Hancock alerted the House of Commons to concerns about a new variant of the virus on 14 December,
====================
<|startofarticle|>  The health secretary has said the government may need to reintroduce mandatory face masks and advise the public to work from home, as he set out the government's plans for coping with Covid in England through the autumn and winter. Sajid Javid told the House of Commons: "Any responsible government must prepare for all eventualities," as he outlined what he called the government's "plan B" in the event that the virus surges.  He conceded that mask-wearing and vaccine passports for crowded venues could be introduced if necessary – as well as "communicating clearly and urgently to the public the need for caution". But he did not mention lockdowns, as he informed the MPs of what he called his "plan A" for managing the virus, "without the need for stringent economic and social restrictions". "We must be vigilant," he told MPs. More details of the government's contingency measures have been set out in a document published alongside Javid's statement, including plans for vaccine passports. The prime minister announced in July that it would be compulsory to prove vaccination status before entering nightclubs and other crowded venues. The government has since backed away from the plan after a backlash from Tory MPs, but Javid confirmed it was being held in reserve. The document says vaccine passports would be applied to all nightclubs; all indoor, crowded settings with 500 or more people such as music venues; all outdoor settings with 4,000 or more people such as festivals; and any venue with 10,000 or more people, such as big sports matches. It acknowledges the plans may need to be implemented at short notice – and encourages businesses to introduce vaccine passports voluntarily. The document also includes advice to the public about how they should behave as winter approaches. They are urged to meet outdoors where possible, keep windows open when meeting indoors, and think twice about activities such as singing or dancing. "In general, the risk of catching or passing on Covid-19 is higher in crowded spaces (where there are more people who might be infectious) and in enclosed indoor spaces (where there is limited fresh air)," the document says. "Some activities, such as singing, dancing and exercising can also increase the risk of transmission of Covid-19 as people are doing activities which generate more particles as they breathe. The risk is greatest where these factors overlap." The public are also cautioned to "wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed settings" – advice taken by very few of the Conservative MPs sitting behind Javid in a busy Commons chamber as he spoke. The government also pointedly refuses to rule out imposing a fresh lockdown. "While the government expects that, with strong engagement from the public and businesses, these contingency measures should be sufficient to reverse a resurgence in autumn or winter, the nature of the virus means it is not possible to give guarantees," the plan says. "The government remains committed to taking whatever action is necessary to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed but more harmful economic and social restrictions would only be considered as a last resort." Plan B would be invoked, the document says, "if the data suggests the NHS is likely to come under unsustainable pressure". Javid said 81% of people over 16 had received two doses of Covid vaccination, and the link between infections, hospitalisation and deaths had been "weakened significantly", so that deaths from the current wave had been "mercifully low". He said the government's plan A included five pillars: renewing efforts to maximise vaccine uptake and expanding it to 12- to 15-year-olds; maintaining the test-and-trace system, including encouraging regular asymptomatic testing; boosting funding for the NHS and social care; encouraging people to modify their behaviour, such as meeting outside; and cooperating with international partners. Javid also confirmed the government would publish a new framework for international travel before the end of this month. Earlier, the government's health advisers announced their recommendation that booster jabs be delivered to the over-50s and younger people with underlying health conditions that make them vulnerable to the virus. Javid confirmed he would take that advice. Children aged between 12 and 15 will also be offered one dose of the Pfizer vaccine, as recommended by the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, and his colleagues. Javid also said it was "highly likely", that vaccination would be made compulsory for frontline NHS workers.

====================
<|startofarticle|>  Boris Johnson has said "we truly did everything we could" to minimise loss of life from coronavirus, and insisted he takes "full responsibility" for the government's handling of the pandemic. But when an inquiry is eventually carried out into the past 12 torrid months, the prime minister will have to face a series of difficult questions about key decisions he made.  As news first began to trickle out of China, triggering the government's pandemic planning, the prime minister left the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to chair the first five meetings of the emergency Cobra committee about the virus. After carrying out a fraught reshuffle of his cabinet, Johnson decamped to the taxpayer-owned mansion of Chevening, and did not chair his first Covid Cobra meeting until 2 March, just before the first confirmed UK death from the virus. Comforted by advisers who compared the challenge to tackling seasonal flu, he tended to play down the seriousness of the pandemic in its early days, insisting it was "business as usual". Most memorably, he told a Downing Street briefing that he "shook hands with everybody" during a hospital visit in early March. With the support of scientific advisers, Johnson took the decision to lift border restrictions on 13 March last year after evidence emerged that the virus was already circulating in the UK, despite a strict quarantine regime for arrivals from Wuhan, in China. At the time, the harsher approach adopted early on by countries such as Singapore and New Zealand, involving flight bans and quarantine, were regarded as extreme by ministers. But many analysts now believe closing the borders was an important precaution that helped these countries and others fare much better. Johnson announced a full-blown lockdown on 23 March last year, with little idea at the time that it would remain in place until July, with many children kept out of the classroom until September. He had edged towards the shutdown via a series of intermediate steps, including banning mass public events and exhorting the public to avoid unnecessary social interaction and to work from home where possible. Only when modelling carried out by Prof Neil Ferguson at Imperial College London suggested there could be up to 500,000 deaths if the virus was not brought under control, and amid growing signs that the public were taking matters into their own hands, did Johnson order the public to stay at home. Some public health experts now believe an earlier shutdown could have saved many thousands of lives. When it emerged that his top adviser had flouted lockdown rules by driving 300-plus miles to Durham, with a day trip to a local town thrown in, Johnson stuck by him resolutely. He told the public at a Downing Street press conference that his aide had acted "responsibly and legally", in crisscrossing the country, ostensibly to seek childcare for his young son, and then to test his eyesight, at a time when the public were being urged to stay at home. His decision sparked an avalanche of angry emails to MPs and risked undermining public confidence in lockdown rules at a critical time.

<|startofarticle|>  Boris Johnson has said "we truly did everything we could" to minimise loss of life from coronavirus, and insisted he takes "full responsibility" for the government's handling of the pandemic. Speaking at a Downing Street press conference after a day of dramatic developments in the Scottish parliament, the prime minister said he and the other ministers had been through enough. "We had extraordinary efforts from all sides" to resolve the issue of a missing package from the government, he said. "We have had full confidence from the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland delegations, which are grieving the loss of loved ones, and they have gone back on their own best efforts to bring people together." He defended the vaccination programme, saying: "We are vaccinating all over-18s and we are going as rapidly as we could, in the autumn and winter, if that is what is recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunisation and Healthcare. If not, we will do everything we can in order to get these people up to speed on what is going on." The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said on Sunday that the government was hoping some rules could be loosened in March, depending on the success of the vaccination programme. Ministers are also waiting to see whether the virus is more rapidly spread, and whether this helps to reduce the spread of the virus among younger, unvaccinated people.

<|startofarticle|>  Keir Starmer has appointed well-respected north-east of England MP Sharon Hodgson as his new parliamentary aide, as he seeks to smooth relations with Labour backbenchers after last weekend's fraught reshuffle. Hodgson, the MP for Washington and Sunderland West since 2010, replaces Carolyn Harris, who resigned earlier this week amid claims that she had stoked up tensions between Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner.  As Starmer's parliamentary private secretary, her job will be to liaise between backbenchers and the leader's office. Some MPs have complained in recent weeks that they felt neglected by Starmer's team. Hodgson will also bring understanding of the north-east, where Labour lost the Hartlepool byelection last week, and the Conservatives made fresh inroads in local council elections. Labour announced several other junior appointments on Friday evening, as the Labour leader completed the shakeup that began in the wake of last week's election results. Peter Kyle, the Hove MP, will be the shadow schools minister, after Wes Streeting was handed a new role overseeing Labour's child poverty strategy. Streeting announced on Friday that he will step back from frontline politics for the time being after being diagnosed with kidney cancer. The leftwinger Andy McDonald will have a beefed-up role in Rayner's new team, as shadow secretary of state for employment rights and protections. Seema Malhotra will be shadow business and consumer minister, replacing Lucy Powell, who was promoted last week to be shadow housing secretary. Other changes include a return to the fold for several MPs who had resigned for various reasons. Flo Eshalomi, MP for Vauxhall, who resigned rather than vote for Boris Johnson's Brexit in December, returns as Rayner's new parliamentary private secretary. Olivia Blake, the MP for Sheffield Hallam, who stepped down over Labour's stance on the overseas operations bill, returns as shadow minister for nature. Starmer's plans for overhauling his frontbench last weekend were held up for much of last Sunday by negotiations with Rayner about what role she would be willing to accept. She relinquished the jobs of party chair and national campaign coordinator, and was instead handed the role of shadowing the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, as well as other titles, including shadow secretary of state for the future of work.

<|startofarticle|>    Labour's share of the vote fell to its lowest level since September, according to new analysis of constituency-by-constituency data. Votes dropped by almost a million people in seats where there are more than 2.5 million electors.  The DIT said that by analysing the constituency boundary changes between 2010 and 2017, it was able to deduce which constituencies would be most vulnerable to pressure from the public. "By modelling the behaviour of voters who switched to another party in a given year, we have helped to show that relatively liberal policies can have a significant impact on protecting constituencies with high density rail networks," the DIT said. By analysing constituency-by-constituency data, the company Electoral Integrity Project linked the most Conservative seats, with the least amount of seats that are "marginal" – those with more than 100,000 people. The target is the target set by law. "We've got to stop the cuts to our frontline services by Ministers [Boris] Johnson and Michael Gove. We've got to stop the privatisation of our services – that's what keeps us in this position." While the Tories have been comprehensively defeated in the North and the Midlands, Labour strategists believe the Tories can take the seats they need to take on Labour, by attracting well-known names such as the "red wall" voters who switched to the party over the summer. Ed Miliband's allies have repeatedly sought to highlight the leadership's record on boosting girls' education, saying they want it to be a "win-win" for both the school-age child and the local authority. But Starmer's team said he is personally committed to the cause of girls' education – and has been highlighting the significant improvements made to the schools by the changes to the Covid vaccination programme.  Changes made to the vaccination programme in recent months have included the return of the vaccine passports of some schools, the return of the habit of taking-home-only schools, and the return of one-to-one binding between teachers, pupils, advisers and administrators. "We believe all of this is very well," said a Labour source. The government is concerned about the possibility that some constituencies may remain closed for months or even weeks, with the ability to impose significant pressure on the NHS. The Department for Education hopes that the strengthening of educational links between teachers, pupils and advisers, as well as the return of the "trolley" to staff up teaching and testing rates, will help to reduce the risk of large-scale redundancies. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, is also more confident that with the virus less prevalent it will be easier to track and control fresh outbreaks, in a way that became all but impossible as the second wave took hold in the winter. "We have very, very detailed, quite granular levels of data – and because the prevalence is lower, there is less noise," said a Department of Health and Social Care source. Labour is more cautious about reinstating the Download Accident Response Scheme, a system that provides support to school-age children during the early days of their infection. The government believes that by making it harder for the public to protect themselves, it will help to increase the number of mandatory self-isolation rules for those in contact with school-aged children, which will come into force on 2023. That will mean that even if a within a week average score of 10,000 is scored, two negative self-isolation records will be required of those who receive the vaccine. The government fears that those already vaccinated could continue to be vulnerable to the virus, particularly if they take up the jab. The Lib Dem home affairs spokesperson Alistair Carmichael said: "Self-isolation is one of the most basic rights. As well as being able to protect against harm to the brain, the right to self-isolate is also the right to make decisions about how and where we live." The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been pushing for more generous payments to workers self-isolation was introduced by the Communities and Local Government Act 2010, allowing them to move beyond the immediate self-isolation requirement and live off-supporting conditions. The care minister, Charlotte Vere, was the first minister to bring forward an intention to deal with the crisis in social care as a "natural sonics wave" brought about by the Omicron crisis. She said as well as being able to care for those in care homes, schizophrenia is a "huge opportunity" for the NHS, because it allows staff to focus more on their jobs and save on sick pay, rather than relying on welfare payments. "Over the next two to three months, we will be seeing even more use of welfare as compared to waiting lists. Over this period we will be seeing a huge spike in the use of social care as compared to previous years. Including this wave, this is it. This is how we will get out of this."

<|startofarticle|>  Generations ago, when the Oxford vaccine was first developed, scientists at the World Health Organization (WHO) regarded it as a cancer of the pandemic. They regarded it as a moral duty to "avoid introducing unnecessary conditions" that would make it difficult or impossible for the virus to pass. They regarded it as a moral responsibility to "avoid unnecessary quarantine measures and to avoid introducing vaccines in large-scale outdoor settings". They regarded it as a moral duty to "avoid discrimination based on sexual orientation and other protected classifications". They regarded it as a moral duty to provide services such as MP testing, and to comply with international travel and hospitality standards.  Their conclusion was that "natural selection has failed to act as a shield from the worse consequences of its failure to act as a shield from vaccine selection." Their colleague Prof Andrew Pollard has called the vaccine "a rare technology asset that can hold up in a world of uncertainty", and insisted it could be a weaponously important tool against the virus.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Keir Starmer is calling on Boris Johnson to scrap his plans for a "vanity yacht" and instead spend the money on tackling antisocial behaviour. Pledging to make Labour "the party of law and order", Starmer highlighted the blight of antisocial behaviour, such as off-road bikes and high-powered cars being raced through residential neighbourhoods.  "As chief prosecutor, I saw far too many examples of crimes perceived as 'low-level' not being tackled quickly enough before they escalate," the Labour leader said. "People can end up afraid in their own homes, or scared to go out at night." In a sign that Starmer may be heeding the pleas of his MPs for him to attack Johnson more forcefully, he added: "I not only understand deeply why tackling antisocial behaviour is needed, but I'm frustrated by the prime minister's priorities. His multimillion-pound vanity yacht isn't addressing people's everyday concerns. Labour will scrap it and fund crime fighting instead." The prime minister's spokesperson recently announced plans for the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to buy a "national flagship", which could be used to host trade delegations. The decision followed a long-running campaign by Johnson's former newspaper the Daily Telegraph for taxpayers to fund a replacement for the Royal Yacht Britannia. While the MoD will be in charge of the procurement process, it is unclear which department will foot the bill. Johnson claimed the vessel would underline the UK's "burgeoning status as a great, independent maritime trading nation". The yacht is expected to cost up to £200m, and Labour estimates the running costs could be £83m over the course of a parliament – based on updating the cost of running the Britannia to 2021 prices. Starmer said that money could be used to create a £285m enforcement fund, allocated to antisocial behaviour hotspots, to provide surge policing, or fund additional CCTV or extra council enforcement officers. Labour would also legislate to crack down on antisocial driving – by requiring a "black box" to be fixed to high-powered rental cars to ensure they were tracked, for example. The party is keen to highlight its determination to crack down on crime, and underscore the impact of police and local authority cuts under successive Conservative governments. Labour strategists believe crime is one of the policy areas that can unite voters on both sides of its fragile electoral coalition – working-class voters in former industrial "red wall" seats and city-based graduates. Starmer's rejection of the national yacht plan may stir memories among Labour veterans of Tony Blair's 1997 stump speeches, when he repeatedly criticised the plans of the then defence secretary, Michael Portillo, for a royal yacht, saying Labour would not waste money on the plan. Then, as now, the Conservatives claimed the vessel would benefit UK trade. Tackling low-level neighbourhood crime was also a recurrent theme for Labour in power, with Blair's government legislating to create antisocial behaviour orders, or Asbos. Starmer has just hired a veteran of the Blair years, Matthew Doyle, to be his temporary director of communications, as longstanding aide Ben Nunn departs. Labour also confirmed that another close Starmer ally, Jenny Chapman, is moving to a frontbench position in the House of Lords, shadowing the government's Brexit minister, David Frost. The moves are part of a thorough shake-up of the Labour leader's backroom operation, with more changes expected to be announced after next week's Batley and Spen byelection.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  The government is investigating the use of "Covid status certificates" to help allow society to reopen, Boris Johnson has announced, as he set out a cautious, four-step unlocking plan for England that will see some sectors remain shuttered until June. "The end really is in sight; and a wretched year will give way to a spring and a summer that will be very different and incomparably better than the picture we see around us today," the prime minister told MPs on Monday as he announced the unlocking plan.  Ministers have repeatedly denied that they would consider the domestic use of so-called vaccine passports, fearing they pose risks of discrimination, as some groups are unable to receive the coronavirus jab. But as part of the government's roadmap out of England's national lockdown, a review will be carried out to assess whether certificates could allow restrictions to be lifted more safely. It is expected to report before June. In a nod to potential objections, Johnson said the review would be, "mindful of the many concerns surrounding exclusion, discrimination and privacy". The keenly awaited roadmap, which the government insists will be dependent on "data, not dates", lays out a four-step reopening process that will see the "stay at home" order remain in place for a further five weeks. With the prime minister keen to avoid having to order a fresh lockdown, he has opted for a gradual lifting of restrictions across England, which is likely to irk some Conservative MPs, who will be given a vote on the plan next month. Schools will reopen to all pupils on 8 March. The only other change at that point will be that two people from different households will be able to meet outside socially, instead of just for exercise. From 29 March, in the second part of step one, the "stay at home" order will lift so people can meet family members in a park or garden, and outdoor sports facilities will be allowed to reopen. In step two, from 12 April, hairdressers and non-essential shops will be allowed to reopen, as well as self-catering accommodation, public buildings such as libraries and museums, and outdoor hospitality such as pub gardens. From 17 May, in step three, most rules on outdoor social contact will be lifted, aside from a limit of 30 on the size of gatherings. Pubs and restaurants will be able to serve customers indoors. In step four, from 21 June, all limits on socialising should be lifted and the government hopes that businesses that were unable to reopen in summer 2020, such as nightclubs, will be able to reopen their doors. The five-week gap between the phases is intended to allow four weeks for data to emerge about the impact of the changes on the disease and a week's notice for the next stage of easing to be introduced. "The chief medical officer is clear that moving any faster would mean acting before we know the impact of each step, which would increase the risk of us having to reverse course and reimpose restrictions. I won't take that risk," the prime minister told the House of Commons. Johnson told MPs: "We're setting out on what I hope and believe is a one-way journey to freedom." He said there was "no credible route" to a zero-Covid Britain - or a zero-Covid world - and argued: "We cannot persist indefinitely with restrictions that debilitate our economy, our physical and mental wellbeing, and the life chances of our children." The factors the government will consider in weighing whether to proceed with the planned dates are: the progress of the vaccination programme; news on new variants of the disease; the shift in hospitalisations and deaths; and whether the number of new infections risks overwhelming the NHS. There was no firm news for families hoping to have a summer break abroad. The government said the ban on international travel would continue until at least 17 May. Meanwhile, ministers will carry out a review into how travel – both inbound and outbound – could safely resume, and what measures should be put in place to facilitate it. Another review will be carried out into mask-wearing, social distancing and working from home, all of which are expected to continue for the time being. That review is expected to be completed before step 4 is implemented in June. Unlike last autumn, when different tiered restrictions were imposed at local level, the changes will be England-wide – though small-scale local lockdowns could be imposed if worrying evidence of new variants emerges. Johnson sought to reassure businesses about the financial impact of the gradual reopening plan, promising "we will not pull the rug out" – but left the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to set out the details in next week's budget. Over time, scientists expect Covid-19 to become endemic, meaning the virus will reach a stable, hopefully manageable level. Vaccinations – including revaccinations – will be key to managing the transition from pandemic to endemic state. Therapeutics and antivirals will

<|startofarticle|> Angela Rayner has been demoted from the shadow cabinet and demoted from the shadow minister for women and equalities, after the departure of the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell.  Changes included the creation of a new, lower role covering child poverty, women's rights and women's employment. Rayner's new frontbench team included the former press secretary to the prime minister, Theresa May, and the former shadow Scotland secretary, Ian Murray, who is no longer on the party's payroll. Liz Truss succeeded Starmer as shadow minister for nature, replacing Gavin Williamson, who was promoted last week. Truss previously worked with Truss on safeguarding human rights, and while on the ministerial payroll, was part of a parliamentary private secretary. Rayner, who was a shadow Cabinet Office minister, was closely involved in Starmer's leadership bid. She was the latest senior party figure to have chimed with Johnson's general election position that the rest of the party was "missing in action". The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, was less complacent earlier this week in the process, announcing that the next step in the roadmap would be handed down in April, with "early arrivals" able to apply for the new "stay at home" order.

<|startofarticle|>   Labour's performance in Thursday's byelection was, ironically, also its most dramatic shift since its general election results were announced last month. Scores of key players from the radical 2019 manifesto were quietly but surely appointed to key posts at Labour's official department, some of whom were recruited for special access to elite constituencies.  As well as being trusted with the media strategy and decision-making, Starmer is widely thought to have been influenced by the early success of his 2019 leadership campaign. "You could argue that he's just learned the lessons of the year," said one frontbencher, who said a committed Corbyn fan would not have been likely to switch sides if given the opportunity. "But there are a variety of factors, just from the general lack of trust that has been there, and the fact that he's only been in post for a few months. It's a learning experience, to be honest." Starmer's supporters insist they are unlikely to want to aloud declare his rule, but the party's internal divisions were on display on Thursday particularly when it comes to the contested boundary changes.

<|startofarticle|>  Keir Starmer has appointed well-respected north of England MP Sharon Hodgson as his new parliamentary aide, as he seeks to smooth relations with Labour backbenchers after last weekend's fraught reshuffle. Hodgson, the MP for Washington and Sunderland West since 2010, replaces Carolyn Harris, who resigned earlier this week amid claims that she had stoked up tensions between Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner.  As Starmer's parliamentary private secretary, her job will be to liaise between backbenchers and the leader's office. Some MPs have complained in recent weeks that they felt neglected by Starmer's team. Hodgson will also bring understanding of the north-east, where Labour lost the Hartlepool byelection last week, and the Conservatives made fresh inroads in local council elections. Labour announced several other junior appointments on Friday evening, as the Labour leader completed the shakeup that began in the wake of last week's election results. Peter Kyle, the Hove MP, will be the shadow schools minister, after Wes Streeting was handed a new role overseeing Labour's child poverty strategy. Streeting announced on Friday that he will step back from frontline politics for the time being after being diagnosed with kidney cancer. The leftwinger Andy McDonald will have a beefed-up role in Rayner's new team, as shadow secretary of state for employment rights and protections. Seema Malhotra will be shadow business and consumer minister, replacing Lucy Powell, who was promoted last week to be shadow housing secretary. Other changes include a return to the fold for several MPs who had resigned for various reasons. Flo Eshalomi, MP for Vauxhall, who resigned rather than vote for Boris Johnson's Brexit in December, returns as Rayner's new parliamentary private secretary. Olivia Blake, the MP for Sheffield Hallam, who stepped down over Labour's stance on the overseas operations bill, returns as shadow minister for nature. Starmer's plans for overhauling his frontbench last weekend were held up for much of last Sunday by negotiations with Rayner about what role she would be willing to accept. She relinquished the jobs of party chair and national campaign coordinator, and was instead handed the role of shadowing the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, as well as other titles, including shadow secretary of state for the future of work.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Boris Johnson has said "we truly did everything we could" to minimise loss of life from coronavirus, and insisted he takes "full responsibility" for the government's handling of the pandemic. But when an inquiry is eventually carried out into the past 12 torrid months, the prime minister will have to face a series of difficult questions about key decisions he made.  As news first began to trickle out of China, triggering the government's pandemic planning, the prime minister left the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to chair the first five meetings of the emergency Cobra committee about the virus. After carrying out a fraught reshuffle of his cabinet, Johnson decamped to the taxpayer-owned mansion of Chevening, and did not chair his first Covid Cobra meeting until 2 March, just before the first confirmed UK death from the virus. Comforted by advisers who compared the challenge to tackling seasonal flu, he tended to play down the seriousness of the pandemic in its early days, insisting it was "business as usual". Most memorably, he told a Downing Street briefing that he "shook hands with everybody" during a hospital visit in early March. With the support of scientific advisers, Johnson took the decision to lift border restrictions on 13 March last year after evidence emerged that the virus was already circulating in the UK, despite a strict quarantine regime for arrivals from Wuhan, in China. At the time, the harsher approach adopted early on by countries such as Singapore and New Zealand, involving flight bans and quarantine, were regarded as extreme by ministers. But many analysts now believe closing the borders was an important precaution that helped these countries and others fare much better. Johnson announced a full-blown lockdown on 23 March last year, with little idea at the time that it would remain in place until July, with many children kept out of the classroom until September. He had edged towards the shutdown via a series of intermediate steps, including banning mass public events and exhorting the public to avoid unnecessary social interaction and to work from home where possible. Only when modelling carried out by Prof Neil Ferguson at Imperial College London suggested there could be up to 500,000 deaths if the virus was not brought under control, and amid growing signs that the public were taking matters into their own hands, did Johnson order the public to stay at home. Some public health experts now believe an earlier shutdown could have saved many thousands of lives. When it emerged that his top adviser had flouted lockdown rules by driving 300-plus miles to Durham, with a day trip to a local town thrown in, Johnson stuck by him resolutely. He told the public at a Downing Street press conference that his aide had acted "responsibly and legally", in crisscrossing the country, ostensibly to seek childcare for his young son, and then to test his eyesight, at a time when the public were being urged to stay at home. His decision sparked an avalanche of angry emails to MPs and risked undermining public confidence in lockdown rules at a critical time. The former TalkTalk executive Dido Harding was brought in by Johnson and Matt Hancock to run the hugely costly test-and-trace system, which has relied heavily on private sector outsourcing and has not worked as effectively as hoped. Councils carrying out their own local contact-tracing operations have generally obtained better results than the call centres run by Serco and other providers, while management consultants have in some cases been paid £7,000 a day for their expertise in setting it up. Johnson and his chancellor, Rishi Sunak, have declined to fix holes in the social safety net – including the paucity of statutory sick pay – that have created a strong financial disincentive for many people to self-isolate. Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance gave the prime minister a briefing on 16 September setting out the dire risks of allowing the virus to run unchecked as cases increased into the autumn. Their colleagues on the Sage committee suggested a short "circuit-breaker" lockdown, perhaps over the October half-term. But Downing Street aides made clear at the time that Johnson considered it to be his role to weigh up scientific advice with other considerations, including the economic and social costs of a fresh lockdown. He therefore opted for a middle course, between the scientists' proposal and the demands of many in his party to resist fresh restrictions: a beefed-up system of "tiers", with tougher rules for the hardest-hit areas. In the event, as Whitty predicted when they were introduced, even the strictest, tier 3 rules did not do enough to restrain the virus, and a month-long lockdown was announced on 31 October. A month before Christmas, the government agreed a plan with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland administrations that would allow up to three households to mix for a fixed five days over the festive period. Johnson then stuck resolutely by the plan, even as cases surged in London and Kent. Matt Hancock alerted the House of Commons to concerns about a new variant of the virus on 14 December,
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Keir Starmer is calling on Boris Johnson to scrap his plans for a "vanity yacht" and instead spend the money on tackling antisocial behaviour. Pledging to make Labour "the party of law and order", Starmer highlighted the blight of antisocial behaviour, such as off-road bikes and high-powered cars being raced through residential neighbourhoods.  "As chief prosecutor, I saw far too many examples of crimes perceived as 'low-level' not being tackled quickly enough before they escalate," the Labour leader said. "People can end up afraid in their own homes, or scared to go out at night." In a sign that Starmer may be heeding the pleas of his MPs for him to attack Johnson more forcefully, he added: "I not only understand deeply why tackling antisocial behaviour is needed, but I'm frustrated by the prime minister's priorities. His multimillion-pound vanity yacht isn't addressing people's everyday concerns. Labour will scrap it and fund crime fighting instead." The prime minister's spokesperson recently announced plans for the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to buy a "national flagship", which could be used to host trade delegations. The decision followed a long-running campaign by Johnson's former newspaper the Daily Telegraph for taxpayers to fund a replacement for the Royal Yacht Britannia. While the MoD will be in charge of the procurement process, it is unclear which department will foot the bill. Johnson claimed the vessel would underline the UK's "burgeoning status as a great, independent maritime trading nation". The yacht is expected to cost up to £200m, and Labour estimates the running costs could be £83m over the course of a parliament – based on updating the cost of running the Britannia to 2021 prices. Starmer said that money could be used to create a £285m enforcement fund, allocated to antisocial behaviour hotspots, to provide surge policing, or fund additional CCTV or extra council enforcement officers. Labour would also legislate to crack down on antisocial driving – by requiring a "black box" to be fixed to high-powered rental cars to ensure they were tracked, for example. The party is keen to highlight its determination to crack down on crime, and underscore the impact of police and local authority cuts under successive Conservative governments. Labour strategists believe crime is one of the policy areas that can unite voters on both sides of its fragile electoral coalition – working-class voters in former industrial "red wall" seats and city-based graduates. Starmer's rejection of the national yacht plan may stir memories among Labour veterans of Tony Blair's 1997 stump speeches, when he repeatedly criticised the plans of the then defence secretary, Michael Portillo, for a royal yacht, saying Labour would not waste money on the plan. Then, as now, the Conservatives claimed the vessel would benefit UK trade. Tackling low-level neighbourhood crime was also a recurrent theme for Labour in power, with Blair's government legislating to create antisocial behaviour orders, or Asbos. Starmer has just hired a veteran of the Blair years, Matthew Doyle, to be his temporary director of communications, as longstanding aide Ben Nunn departs. Labour also confirmed that another close Starmer ally, Jenny Chapman, is moving to a frontbench position in the House of Lords, shadowing the government's Brexit minister, David Frost. The moves are part of a thorough shake-up of the Labour leader's backroom operation, with more changes expected to be announced after next week's Batley and Spen byelection.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Rutger Thacker, the darling of the ultra-rich, is mulling a comeback to frontline politics. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has been hammering him for months about the failings of the political class, especially after the humiliating loss of the Hartlepool byelection last month.  Director of communications Ben Nunn has said the focus on "levelling up" was missed out on by strategists before the Hartlepool result, which held even more of the key institutions up. "The result meant that there was a real chance of a byelection on Thursday, and the focus on levelling up has now shifted to winning back prime minister's offices," said James Johnson, a pollster with JL Partners who previously worked for Theresa May. "That means we need to do all we can in an election year to build up the Ashes-Covid message – and the right moment to do that is now," he said, in remarks widely seen as supportive of the Conservative candidate.  Elections experts have long been sceptical about beingleaguered by the idea of voters being distracted by the campaign, and many believe that by throwing their weight behind someone who may lose them over the summer, they will less likely to take the next step forward. But ministers are concerned that the focus of the dip in the voter mood music may have been missed by disgruntled Labour members, who may also have not yet realised it was an attempt to detract from Keir Starmer's. The party's membership surged in the wake of the Hartlepool byelection, and some MPs believe it may be partly to blame. "Members are coming in and out looking for a change of heart, and Keir is just playing whack-a-mole," said Richard Burgon, a elections expert and deputy director of the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank. "Members want people who are going to be most vulnerable to cyber-attacks, and they want to make sure they aren't breaking the rules in the first place." He added: "Members feel they've got a collective responsibility to take on the matter of properly prosecuting breaches of trust, and they're satisfied that has been achieved by committed and transparent action." Starmer's team have played down the party's shortcomings, however. The former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, who was recently suspended from his job for saying some of the same things as senior workers, said the campaign was "like Tony Blair's leadership". However, Javid's statement came as Starmer's team bid to restore some of the faith that candidates have made in the electoral process to one side and the existing directors of communications have collectively spent £7bn on campaigns. "We can and must and must and this is going to change," said a party spokesperson. Their task is aided by the fact that a small number of formal part-time workers are being offered a pay increase of 8% over the previous year, and by the introduction of a "living wage" for many of the lowest paid jobs, the spokesperson said. "We are also setting up a 'living wage' advisory committee to ensure that businesses are prepared for the next general election with reasonable pay rates," he said. Labour has already announced that it would place the on-going legal action against Rob Ford, the man who was photographed kissing a colleague on a trip to the US in December 2020, will not be heard from again "shortly". The shadow cabinet office minister and close ally of Starmer has repeatedly insisted that the Ford affair is not yet fixed, and there was "no change" in the prime minister's thinking. As the parliamentary party met for its final session on Tuesday, Johnson's spokesperson conceded that the "tag team" of senior MPs had spent much of the past month watching the mayor of London blush at the inappropriateness of a holidaying in a shared hotel room with a rich woman he had met on the campaign trail. But Johnson's spokesperson said he and Starmer had different approaches. "You know, my style is more robust as people know: I'm more bombastic, in the way in which do things, I say it how I see it: and therefore I bring that freshness to the partnership." He added: "You know, my style is also very different because I'm a campaigner and I'm about to take on a global scale. And what I want to do is I want to take on a global government and I want it to look very much like the Tony Blair government that they've used to try and blow up the economy and the house into the sunset, and then they can't quite manage the mess that it is making."
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Keir Starmer has appointed well-respected north-east of England MP Sharon Hodgson as his new parliamentary aide, as he seeks to smooth relations with Labour backbenchers after last weekend's fraught reshuffle. Hodgson, the MP for Washington and Sunderland West since 2010, replaces Carolyn Harris, who resigned earlier this week amid claims that she had stoked up tensions between Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner.  As Starmer's parliamentary private secretary, her job will be to liaise between backbenchers and the leader's office. Some MPs have complained in recent weeks that they felt neglected by Starmer's team. Hodgson will also bring understanding of the north-east, where Labour lost the Hartlepool byelection last week, and the Conservatives made fresh inroads in local council elections. Labour announced several other junior appointments on Friday evening, as the Labour leader completed the shakeup that began in the wake of last week's election results. Peter Kyle, the Hove MP, will be the shadow schools minister, after Wes Streeting was handed a new role overseeing Labour's child poverty strategy. Streeting announced on Friday that he will step back from Twitter use for the time being as he seeks to focus on running the country.  Other changes include moving from the shoulders of his deputy, Andrew Bridgen, who was promoted last week to be Shadow Trade and Investment Board President. The former shadow chancellor John McDonnell will have a new role creating new jobs for the sector as the makeup of Labour's staff adjusts to the new political axis. Oliver Dowden will no longer be writing Labour's Daily Telegraph, but was chosen instead as the new party chair. Williams will no longer be making TV appearances as the party tries to rebuild after a year in which many voters went into the election with a sense that the Conservatives had been badly damaged by Labour's mishandling of the Brexit crisis. However, there has been criticism from within the party from senior figures in the business department, who were keen for the weekend to focus on the wider election battle rather than taking on Boris Johnson's government. Chief of staff Morgan McSweeney and policy director Claire Ainsley were at the centre of a string of high-profile leaks about the shape of the Conservative party in recent months, with the former sending MPs and the latter, more recently, Dominic Cummings. Cummings has been particularly scathing about the Covid press secretary, Hanif Kwasi-Muntinen, who was absent from the press secretary's messages, despite Kwasi-Muntinen having been at the centre of a string of high-profile interventions, including the successful delivery of the Covid vaccine last week.  In Cummings' latest Twitter posts – delivered, he said, while awaiting his vaccination – he rubbished the idea of a public inquiry. "The point of the inquiry is the opposite of learning, it is to delay scrutiny, preserve the broken system & distract public from real questions, leaving the parties & senior civil service essentially untouched," he said. Instead, he wants lessons to be learned now – including, perhaps, about his former boss's personal failings. And with most of the key players still in post and bound by collective responsibility, testimony from someone who was on the inside when many of the critical decisions were made is bound to be revelatory. Yet after last weekend's embarrassing result, many are likely to remember the speeches, reports say, from the hard-left, the boldness that saw Emmanuel Macron and Angela Rayner step up across the political spectrum. Rayner's supporters remember the days of reading about her exploits, before picking up the phone calls of former colleagues and allies. There are also the memories of her children, who remember the constant reminders of her developinga moody-blue Ford F-150 jet taking off and of course of everything that wrongs.  But for her many critics, a lack of trust is also afoot, as well as the lingering impression that she is a hostage to the interests of big business. The former shadow chancellor John McDonnell wrote on Sunday: "The party has always been a shadow of its former self, and that is a fact. But we have also got to be honest with ourselves: we are a government in crisis. Dysfunctional, insecure and vulnerable. Completely apart of what we believe," he said the party's moral authority had been undermined by the "acts of a few," including the management of a bankrupt company. Turnout in the PCS's last ballot of staff earlier this year was only just over the 50% legal threshold for triggering industrial action. And it was well below the 50% legal threshold for forming a political party. McDonnell's supporters on the parliamentary Labour party believe the PCS's success is linked to two factors, political secretary Lee Cain and political secretary Will Jennings' determination to root out cronyism. Chief of staff Morgan McSweeney and policy director Claire Ainsley were thought to be the most recent recipients of the "levelling up" fund, but critics say
====================
<|startofarticle|>  The government is investigating the use of "Covid status certificates" to help allow society to reopen, Boris Johnson has announced, as he set out a cautious, four-step unlocking plan for England that will see some sectors remain shuttered until June. "The end really is in sight; and a wretched year will give way to a spring and a summer that will be very different and incomparably better than the picture we see around us today," the prime minister told MPs on Monday as he announced the unlocking plan.  Ministers have repeatedly denied that they would consider the domestic use of so-called vaccine passports, fearing they pose risks of discrimination, as some groups are unable to receive the coronavirus jab. But as part of the government's roadmap out of England's national lockdown, a review will be carried out to assess whether certificates could allow restrictions to be lifted more safely. It is expected to report before June. In a nod to potential objections, Johnson said the review would be, "mindful of the many concerns surrounding exclusion, discrimination and privacy". The keenly awaited roadmap, which the government insists will be dependent on "data, not dates", lays out a four-step reopening process that will see the "stay at home" order remain in place for a further five weeks. With the prime minister keen to avoid having to order a fresh lockdown, he has opted for a gradual lifting of restrictions across England, which is likely to irk some Conservative MPs, who will be given a vote on the plan next month. Schools will reopen to all pupils on 8 March. The only other change at that point will be that two people from different households will be able to meet outside socially, instead of just for exercise. From 29 March, in the second part of step one, the "stay at home" order will lift so people can meet family members in a park or garden, and outdoor sports facilities will be allowed to reopen. In step two, from 12 April, hairdressers and non-essential shops will be allowed to reopen, as well as self-catering accommodation, public buildings such as libraries and museums, and outdoor hospitality such as pub gardens. From 17 May, in step three, most rules on outdoor social contact will be lifted, aside from a limit of 30 on the size of gatherings. Pubs and restaurants will be able to serve customers indoors. In step four, from 21 June, all limits on socialising should be lifted and the government hopes that businesses that were unable to reopen in summer 2020, such as nightclubs, will be able to reopen their doors. The five-week gap between the phases is intended to allow four weeks for data to emerge about the impact of the changes on the disease and a week's notice for the next stage of easing to be introduced. "The chief medical officer is clear that moving any faster would mean acting before we know the impact of each step, which would increase the risk of us having to reverse course and reimpose restrictions. I won't take that risk," the prime minister told the House of Commons. Johnson told MPs: "We're setting out on what I hope and believe is a one-way journey to freedom." He said there was "no credible route" to a zero-Covid Britain - or a zero-Covid world - and argued: "We cannot persist indefinitely with restrictions that debilitate our economy, our physical and mental wellbeing, and the life chances of our children." The factors the government will consider in weighing whether to proceed with the planned dates are: the progress of the vaccination programme; news on new variants of the disease; the shift in hospitalisations and deaths; and whether the number of new infections risks overwhelming the NHS. There was no firm news for families hoping to have a summer break abroad. The government said the ban on international travel would continue until at least 17 May. Meanwhile, ministers will carry out a review into how travel – both inbound and outbound – could safely resume, and what measures should be put in place to facilitate it. Another review will be carried out into mask-wearing, social distancing and working from home, all of which are expected to continue for the time being. That review is expected to be completed before step 4 is implemented in June. Unlike last autumn, when different tiered restrictions were imposed at local level, the changes will be England-wide – though small-scale local lockdowns could be imposed if worrying evidence of new variants emerges. Johnson sought to reassure businesses about the financial impact of the gradual reopening plan, promising "we will not pull the rug out" – but left the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to set out the details in next week's budget. Over time, scientists expect Covid-19 to become endemic, meaning the virus will reach a stable, hopefully manageable level. Vaccinations – including revaccinations – will be key to managing the transition from pandemic to endemic state. Therapeutics and antivirals will

<|startofarticle|>  Keir Starmer is calling on the Conservative party to show the true colours of voters it has failed to in the early days of the pandemic. The former leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has written to six senior Conservatives urging them to scrap their "cower" Liberal Democrats – renomination or defeat – and focus on building support for a leadership challenge.  Two of the party's erstwhile supporters, he claimed, have "sought after by dishonest and irresponsible Conservatives the last thing to the party". The trio, who have included Emily Thornberry, the author of the recent pamphlet How Brexit Can Be Hurt, say they need to show the Conservatives have changed. "We have got to look outward and show people believe we have changed. We have got to look at ourselves and we have got to look forward. We have got to look forward and we have got to look out for the country and the interests of our families and the economy and the economy and the economy and the economy and the economy and we have got to change. We have got to change," they said. "We have got to look outward and show people believe we have changed. We have got to look out for our country and the people we want to talk to." Thornberry and her colleagues have been joined in the pouring rain in Downing Street by Esther McVey, the party's former director of communications, who worked closely with Boris Johnson during the prime minister's time as leader. McVey, who was a shadow Cabinet Office minister, will give a three-day appearance before the parliamentary private secretary, Simon Clarke, who was a friend of Jo Cox and has worked with her on the campaign.

<|startofarticle|>  Generations ago, when the Oxford English Dictionary was first published, people asked: "What is a 'new' word, rarely used in a scientific sense at all, that isn't frequently used in news stories to describe the government's approach in tackling the pandemic?" But the government now hopes that the daily use of the word will help to capture the public's attention and, ultimately, a better deal for taxpayers. In a statement on Friday, the health secretary, Sajid Javid, said: "Right from the start, we have said we oppose the use of the word 'new' in the way the health secretary has described it." He added: "We oppose the use of the word 'variant' in the way the health secretary has described it." Javid earlier said he was notifying the public of the government's change of position, but instead was asked to respond to a question from a constituent who claimed: "You said the government is opposed to the use of the word 'variant'." Javid said the question was not about the government's changed position, but whether the privacy of the electors who approve of it are also being questioned. The prime minister had previously been criticised for initially trying to force the UK to pay for a $10bn contract to build the Covid vaccine network in Ireland, before the coalition came to power. The prime minister had previously been criticised for initially negotiating on a trade deal with the UK, before the Brexit process was changed in the wake of the Brexit crisis. With the EU's financial arrangements set to be reviewed by the EU taskforce in Jerez this week, the UK is keen to have it announced and agreed by the pair of powerful House of Commons committees, before moving on to the next stage of the roadmap. The government is also keen for the meetings to be focused on other priorities, including informing the public about the major announcements made by the government, and giving the NHS a chance to reorient. It is understood the prime minister is expected to state his position orally – without sound bites, as he spoke on the phone from Chequers on Friday. Cummings has suggested there may have been up to 40 announcements at once, but the prime minister has not yet said whether he will refocus the government on the task at hand. Instead, he is focusing on answering a simple question: why are you in politics and what are you setting out to achieve?" – Rappler.com understands that Johnson has heard repeatedly from former colleagues who have felt let down by the pandemic, and who say they felt as though their support for the government had been stripped away. One source said: "At the beginning, I would have said it was pretty easy to look after the interests of the taxpayer. Now, I've changed my mind – I think we're very, very close to breaking out." The source added: "The thing that feels important about it is, there's a real sense that the taxpayer doesn't trust the government with anything, so they take their cues from where they can get the most information." The former shadow cabinet minister John McDonnell wrote on Sunday: "The thing is, the reason the public trust the government to take their cues from them, there's a real risk of sleaze from the government getting away with it before the next general election. [It] feels like the same old Conservatives who think protecting an individual is the No 10 role doing a poor job of protecting the people they claim to be protecting."

====================
<|startofarticle|>  Jeremy Corbyn's surprise win in Batley and Spen has delighted the Labour leader, whose nearest electoral challenger is the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, after drawing a virtual blank the past fortnight. Despite the tightest restrictions in Europe, few results were surprising – until now.  On Wednesday Boris Johnson put the finishing touches of a festive season present himself – going as far back as he could remember, in the run-up to the Euro 2016 summits in Glasgow in 1990 and London in 2019.  On Thursday morning after much speculation about his Aukus defence and security deal the President had already promised himself would be "cautiously optimistic" about the situation in the region, the President announced that "a huge amount of our own time and effort" would be devoted to the crisis zone, and promised a "green and digital break" from Thursday's date on which to announce a "green and digital break with the old model and a new approach". Johnson was cheered by his mates at the press conference, who described him as an "autumn fly" who would "make a great campaigner". The President's announcement was cheered by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, who said the UK would "build a better world". When asked about the prospects of a Labour government opposing the EU's approach, Starmer said: "I think it is highly likely that they will say no." But Johnson did not mention Starmer by name, so BBC Two's Jonathan footnote contributed to the selectivity of the name. The production company ITV created with the services of former Tory donor David Ross, the company has a public offering worth £BP6m. It has a board of directors and a financial adviser who are not bound by any formal Labour rulebook, but it is understood they are not actively involved in the decisions-making process. The Financial Times reported at the time that the Financial Times had written to the Office of the Lord Chief of Staff, Sir Simon Stevens, to ask him whether Labour was contemplating a legal challenge of the former chief executive's decision to back the government's Covid policies. Stevens, who once liked to call himself "the football doctor who wears the tie", has since complained of having to redouble his efforts to win over Starmer's base. Stevens' concerns have been echoed by the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, who told the Financial Times on Wednesday that the Labour leader should "go back to where you came from". The UK's main political party on Wednesday also urged Sunak to "avoid creating the impression that you are immune to the concerns of sceptics". Steve Reed, general secretary of the Labour party, said: "We all want to be rivals but the more we look at the situation the worse we are."
====================
<|startofarticle|>  "Reshuffle" seemed an understatement, given the radical scope of the shake-up Keir Starmer carried out among Labour's top ranks on Monday, with few posts left untouched. Starmer's aides saw it as completing the work begun in May's botched overhaul, which saw Anneliese Dodds replaced by Rachel Reeves as shadow chancellor; but was derailed by Angela Rayner, who resisted a move for herself.  Changes for both Jon Ashworth and Lisa Nandy were mooted at the time, and have now been acted on. And this time around, Starmer publicly asserted his authority over Rayner – with whom relations have continued to be scratchy – by kicking off the reshuffle as she was delivering a major speech in Westminster on cleaning up public life. She was briefly informed that a shake-up was under way; but not consulted (though Jeremy Corbyn certainly didn't consult his deputy, Tom Watson, on the makeup of his shadow team either). The end result marked a shift to the political right, and created a powerful platform for rising stars Wes Streeting and Bridget Phillipson, both viewed as effective media performers. Shadow cabinet ministers had recently complained about how much airtime Streeting was getting, despite holding the relatively junior post of shadow schools minister. As shadow health secretary in the midst of a pandemic, he will now be a key spokesperson and public face of a potential future Labour government. One Labour insider suggested there had been little effort to match people to their expertise – citing Steve Reed's move to shadow justice, for example – and an overwhelming focus on who can deliver a punchy media performance. More low-key shadow ministers, including Kate Green at education and Luke Pollard at environment, both of whom were viewed by colleagues as diligent and thoughtful, were unceremoniously ditched. Tellingly, one Starmer aide told the Politico newsletter – a daily note for Westminster insiders – that the reshuffle had put, "fresh hungry effective message-carriers in key briefs". His team are ruthlessly pursuing the aim of winning over swing voters in a handful of key seats, many of them in the "red wall", and want people in place who are reassuring to Conservative-Labour switchers, not redolent of Corbyn. They believe they are succeeding for the first time in a long time in having a leader voters can imagine as prime minister; and are delighted by the performance of Reeves, including, recently, a highly positive profile in the Telegraph; but they now want to build on that by creating a wider team the public can imagine as a government. To that end, the overhaul also saw the return of Labour "big beast" Yvette Cooper, one of a relatively small number of sitting MPs – with Ed Miliband and Hilary Benn – who have been cabinet ministers. Starmer appeared to avoid such tall poppies in his first frontbench team, instead promoting Nick Thomas-Symonds and Dodds, both intellectuals with deep expertise, but without their own powerbases in the party. One longtime Labour insider remarked that both Cooper and Miliband are "more experienced politicians than Keir," suggesting that by moving Miliband sideways and bringing Cooper into the tent, he must now feel his own position is more secure. So for Starmer's team, the reshuffle was an assertion of his authority, which had been battered by the ham-fisted reshuffle back in May; and a signal of intent to voters, with a general election potentially just a couple of years away. For MPs on Labour's soft left, who had previously regarded Starmer as one of their own, the end result was a sense of gnawing disquiet about a continued drift to the right, however. And some warned that the relentless focus on target voters in the red wall, while understandable given the shape of 2019's crushing defeat, risked alienating other groups Labour may need if it is ultimately to succeed in forming the next government.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  <|startofarticle|> Keir Starmer is in "discussions" about whether to press ahead with radical changes to the way Labour elects its leaders, as the party prepares to close a bloody budget next week. The party announced the radical package of changes on Tuesday in a press conference in Brighton.  The plans, which would make it harder for a party to raise and pass legislation in the run-up to the next general election, were confirmed by the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, as the party set out its stall for the coming weeks.  Starmer had previously been expected to break with party orthodoxy by bringing forward female MPs as a way of dealing with the aftermath of the pandemic. But after the announcement of the changes, some Labour MPs took to the floor of parliament to demand answers. "It's about time," shouted one shadow cabinet minister. "If we don't have a leadership, we don't have a vision, and we don't have the ability to bring forward a vision, then we're not going to get on," said the well-liked and amenable Dodds. "The only way to get on with what we are doing is to be bold and to think differently than we have done." Labour insiders said the party had also been hampered by the difficulty of a fiscal cliff cut, which meant the party was only expected to raise £400m in the next financial year. But the political and economic terrain has been changed dramatically by the past 12 months, in ways that are likely to be long-lasting.  Starmer's team have repeatedly insisted there are "no plans" for a fiscal cliff cut, but they could decide to itc instead. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, increased two key benefits, universal credit and the basic element of working tax credit, by £20 a week during the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic last spring. Johnson has not yet said whether that money will be used to increase the welfare cap or create a new £15-a-week universal credit cut in the autumn. Johnson's official spokesperson has insisted the money raised will go directly to the NHS, rather than helping the NHS. "There are no plans to increase the £20 a week universal credit benefit," he said on a visit to the new health secretary's office in Surrey. "We are investing in the NHS, the best single policy for the future of health for millions of people will be the creation of more benefit for money," he said. The prime minister had previously been sceptical about allowing families to switch off from the Covid app, believing it would make no difference. Johnson said at the time the average adult in England was going to be unable to afford a loved one to care for them. "They say to me they need care homes for their families. Well, that is a stretch, but you get the idea," he said, adding: "You also need care homes for the over-80s and the care that's left over from the pandemic. And the more care people are able to donate, the more valuable the care home, and the more opportunities there are for people to get care, the more valuable the vaccine means."
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Boris Johnson has said "we truly did everything we could" to minimise loss of life from coronavirus, and insisted he takes "full responsibility" for the government's handling of the pandemic. Speaking as he completed a three-day visit to Northern Ireland, the prime minister said he and his fellow leaders had a special relationship and that it was because of the Conservative government's "tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime".  "We love our neighbours as much as we love our country," he said, stressing the fact that many of the same people were now calling their communities together. "That's why we love our neighbour as much as we love ourselves," he said, adding: "We knew there would be a reaction from the police, from the courts, from the press. So we worked very closely with police forces across England to make sure they were as forthcoming with information as we were with the public. "In working closely with police forces, we've been able to play a key role in making sure that never happens." Johnson's official spokesperson has insisted striking a striking agreement with unions was reached in the autumn, but he was forced to deny any knowledge of plans for strike action at the weekend. "There are negotiations with unions ongoing, and they are being held under tight rules regime," he said. Asked why there had been no immediate reports of a strike, he said: "We are working closely with unions to try to get these things done, and I would like to see them to allow us to do it." The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said on Sunday that the government was hoping strike action could spark a debate on the "controversial" European convention on manhood, which the UK signed up to.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour's performance on Thursday was widely seen as a potential future in parliament – but the party's internal divisions were on display so stark that even Dominic Raab was taken aback and had to deny there was a plan in place to rectify the law. Pubs were being repaired in shops, while empty seats in the lower house of the parliament were being filled. There were even claims that the Labour leader could muster the 40 MPs necessary to override the whip, but that was being dashed by Starmer. One senior party aide said: "There's a huge amount of despair in the Labour party, including inside the party, that there aren't any immediate plans to change the Conservatives' majority. There is also a feeling the Tories have taken them for granted. Johnson is very clear that he will take the Conservatives on if they are found to be effective – though he could try to use the 2019 general election to his advantage. The Conservatives made a total of more than 100 changes to the social security system in the 2014 general election, with the last straw being the last minute squeak. Many Conservative MPs have since resigned. The party hopes to make the changes by the end of the decade, but the government is also keen to raise questions about the finances of the former art dealer Andrew Murray, who was found to have defamed the Saudi royal family.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Keir Starmer has appointed well-respected north-east of England MP Sharon Hodgson as his new parliamentary aide, as he seeks to smooth relations with Labour backbenchers after last weekend's fraught reshuffle. Hodgson, the MP for Washington and Sunderland West since 2010, replaces Carolyn Harris, who resigned earlier this week amid claims that she had stoked up tensions between Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner.  As Starmer's parliamentary private secretary, her job will be to liaise between backbenchers and the leader's office. Some MPs have complained in recent weeks that they felt neglected by Starmer's team. Hodgson will also bring understanding of the north-east, where Labour lost the Hartlepool byelection last week, and the Conservatives made fresh inroads in local council elections. Labour announced several other junior appointments on Friday evening, as the Labour leader completed the shakeup that began in the wake of last week's election results. Peter Kyle, the Hove MP, will be the shadow schools minister, after Wes Streeting was handed a new role overseeing Labour's child poverty strategy. Streeting announced on Friday that he will step back from frontline politics for the time being after being diagnosed with kidney cancer. The leftwinger Andy McDonald will have a beefed-up role in Rayner's new team, as shadow secretary of state for employment rights and protections. Seema Malhotra will be shadow business and consumer minister, replacing Lucy Powell, who was promoted last week to be shadow housing secretary. Other changes include a return to the fold for several MPs who had resigned for various reasons. Flo Eshalomi, MP for Vauxhall, who resigned rather than vote for Boris Johnson's Brexit in December, returns as Rayner's new parliamentary private secretary. Olivia Blake, the MP for Sheffield Hallam, who stepped down over Labour's stance on the overseas operations bill, returns as shadow minister for nature. Starmer's plans for overhauling his frontbench last weekend were held up for much of last Sunday by negotiations with Rayner about what role she would be willing to accept. She relinquished the jobs of party chair and national campaign coordinator, and was instead handed the role of shadowing the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, as well as other titles, including shadow secretary of state for the future of work.

====================
<|startofarticle|>  The government is investigating the use of "Covid status certificates" to help allow society to reopen, Boris Johnson has announced, as he set out a cautious, four-step unlocking plan for England that will see some sectors remain shuttered until June. "The end really is in sight; and a wretched year will give way to a spring and a summer that will be very different and incomparably better than the picture we see around us today," the prime minister told MPs on Monday as he announced the unlocking plan.  Ministers have repeatedly denied that they would consider the domestic use of so-called vaccine passports, fearing they pose risks of discrimination, as some groups are unable to receive the coronavirus jab. But as part of the government's roadmap out of England's national lockdown, a review will be carried out to assess whether certificates could allow restrictions to be lifted more safely. It is expected to report before June. In a nod to potential objections, Johnson said the review would be, "mindful of the many concerns surrounding exclusion, discrimination and privacy". The keenly awaited roadmap, which the government insists will be dependent on "data, not dates", lays out a four-step reopening process that will see the "stay at home" order remain in place for a further five weeks. With the prime minister keen to avoid having to order a fresh lockdown, he has opted for a gradual lifting of restrictions across England, which is likely to irk some Conservative MPs, who will be given a vote on the plan next month. Schools will reopen to all pupils on 8 March. The only other change at that point will be that two people from different households will be able to meet outside socially, instead of just for exercise. From 29 March, in the second part of step one, the "stay at home" order will lift so people can meet family members in a park or garden, and outdoor sports facilities will be allowed to reopen. In step two, from 12 April, hairdressers and non-essential shops will be allowed to reopen, as well as self-catering accommodation, public buildings such as libraries and museums, and outdoor hospitality such as pub gardens. From 17 May, in step three, most rules on outdoor social contact will be lifted, aside from a limit of 30 on the size of gatherings. Pubs and restaurants will be able to serve customers indoors. In step four, from 21 June, all limits on socialising should be lifted and the government hopes that businesses that were unable to reopen in summer 2020, such as nightclubs, will be able to reopen their doors. The five-week gap between the phases is intended to allow four weeks for data to emerge about the impact of the changes on the disease and a week's notice for the next stage of easing to be introduced. "The chief medical officer is clear that moving any faster would mean acting before we know the impact of each step, which would increase the risk of us having to reverse course and reimpose restrictions. I won't take that risk," the prime minister told the House of Commons. Johnson told MPs: "We're setting out on what I hope and believe is a one-way journey to freedom." He said there was "no credible route" to a zero-Covid Britain - or a zero-Covid world - and argued: "We cannot persist indefinitely with restrictions that debilitate our economy, our physical and mental wellbeing, and the life chances of our children." The factors the government will consider in weighing whether to proceed with the planned dates are: the progress of the vaccination programme; news on new variants of the disease; the shift in hospitalisations and deaths; and whether the number of new infections risks overwhelming the NHS. There was no firm news for families hoping to have a summer break abroad. The government said the ban on international travel would continue until at least 17 May. Meanwhile, ministers will carry out a review into how travel – both inbound and outbound – could safely resume, and what measures should be put in place to facilitate it. Another review will be carried out into mask-wearing, social distancing and working from home, all of which are expected to continue for the time being. That review is expected to be completed before step 4 is implemented in June. Unlike last autumn, when different tiered restrictions were imposed at local level, the changes will be England-wide – though small-scale local lockdowns could be imposed if worrying evidence of new variants emerges. Johnson sought to reassure businesses about the financial impact of the gradual reopening plan, promising "we will not pull the rug out" – but left the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to set out the details in next week's budget. Over time, scientists expect Covid-19 to become endemic, meaning the virus will reach a stable, hopefully manageable level. Vaccinations – including revaccinations – will be key to managing the transition from pandemic to endemic state. Therapeutics and antivirals will

<|startofarticle|>  Generations ago, when the world's leaders faced off over the chaotic response to the Omicron pandemic in Brazil, the world's leaders decided timidly that "captive citizenship" was the way to go. Now, say the scientists, you can't hold the G7 meeting in Cornwall unless you have been warned to "shore up by imposing a strict new health and security alliance on the world stage". By contrast, the new foreign secretary, Liz Truss, will have to decide whether her party is really "missing in action" by taking the extraordinary step she has taken today. She will give the House of Commons a vote on the proposals for a new bioreactors exemption, which will give the government the go-ahead if necessary to bring new vaccines and drugs into the country.  As MPs recalled their recess from Covid-19 to 22 on Tuesday, many at Westminster had heard last week's government was planning a "big bang" reopening of the economy. But the prime minister is under pressure to say what he means when he says "our country is in no part responsible for the disruption caused by crowded out groups such as these". The new bioreactor, which is needed to manufacture the next generation of vaccines, is expected to beep loudly in the run-up to Wednesday's vote. It is likely to be a warning shot in the past days ahead of the crucial European Union summit in Glasgow in November, when Boris Johnson's cabinet are due to discuss the progress of the vaccination programme. It is also likely to be ignored by the public moody ahead of the next general election in 2024. There has been anecdotal evidence in recent weeks that the public are less torn between their newfound freedoms this week – a slight dip in the average temperature and a slight increase in the number of people being admitted to hospitals. And Johnson's insistence at Wednesday's press conference that the government has "done an outstanding job" of "levelling up" the UK – well, that is a long time to have a big-hit job on the NHS, after all. But the longer the delay is, the more likely it is that the public will justifiably bemoan the length of the pandemic. And the health secretary, Sajid Javid, has barely touched the backlog of cases at his own department since late October, when he underlined the need for "hard-working care workers" to "find a role" for which to source the cash.
====================
<|startofarticle|>  Labour MPs on the green and yellow benches were stunned and horrified by the use of a member's vote to force Boris Johnson to attend a meeting of the government's green and yellow delegations. Only one MP has apologised for his or her vote in favour of the vaccine passports amendment, which passed by MPs on Wednesday. The shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, was sent out to apologise for the insensitive way Johnson spoke at a press conference on Monday: without anaesthetic. The NEC had been briefed on the proposal and were aware that it had not yet been formally suggested. On Thursday morning, the plans were confirmed by the prime minister, who said that the "article in the paper" was "what we always have talked about is an article in and of itself", and that "it cannot possibly pass".  But when asked about whether Johnson had apologised, he said: "I don't discuss my conversations with prime ministers." He added: "I would like to talk to him about the matter further." The health secretary, Sajid Javid, rejected reports on Wednesday that the health secretary, Sajid Rofi, had been forced to apologise for breaking lockdown rules. "I don't discuss my private conversations with prime ministers," he said. "But, in relation to the Dilnot review, which involves the challenge of Covid, and the review involves the challenge of transmitting the virus, and the government's attitude is that it would be in the public interest to do so, then that is perfectly OK." He added: "There is no evidence at this stage that the challenge is to try and reduce the number of people coming into the UK, or to increase the intake of people who are cholera-prone." Asked what would happen if the public believed his or her disbelief that the government was considering the issue to be "fine tuning," Javid said: "We are as keen as ever to get this thing under control. If it makes sense, we will." He added: "It is entirely possible, depending on the model that we use. But, in the event, the public are still looking to get the virus under control, and the measures that we are considering are those that are necessary to contain the spread of the virus." The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said on Sunday that the government hoped to ease the lockdown restrictions in England in March. "When we get to a situation in the early spring, perhaps March, if we succeed in hitting those targets," he told Marr. "We can then start the process of lifting the restrictions back in some capacity, if we like." But he stressed that without decisive action from the prime minister, the government was unlikely to get away with giving the NHS a second dose of Covid. "The problem with the current policy is that it is simply not viable," he said. "If the health secretary thinks it is viable to give the NHS a third dose, then so be it." The government has repeatedly been criticised throughout the pandemic for failing to control the UK's borders, but ministers had become particularly concerned about the Brazilian variant of the virus. It is unclear whether Boris Johnson will have enough influence to convince the public to wait until the autumn, when the NHS appears at risk of being overwhelmed, before moving to make the pandemic worse.
