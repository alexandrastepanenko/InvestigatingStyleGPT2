0,0,The Sun,Harry ColeJack ElsomSam Blanchard,Boris Johnson issues booster call to arms as positive data raises hopes for New Year,"A BOOSTER jab is the best Christmas gift you can give your family, Boris Johnson told The Sun last night — as data revealed Omicron is half as likely to put people in hospital. The stunning news from around 80,000 of the first Omicron cases in the UK has finally confirmed hopes that the latest strain is milder. Downing Street had been braced to announce a ""circuit breaker"". But the new data means no announcement on restrictions for next week are expected before the festive weekend. Hopes were rising that fresh curbs could be avoided altogether if hospital admissions do not spike. Revellers were still warned not to make plans for New Year's Eve just yet after daily confirmed cases passed 100,000 for the first time in the pandemic. But it was also another daily record for boosters with a total of 1.06million first, second and third jabs in arms. Of those, 968,665 were boosters. Thousands of Brits have already signed up to The Sun's Jabs Army campaign in bid to slow the spread of Omicron this winter. Last night the PM issued a rallying cry to Sun readers, warning that two jabs are not enough to fight the new mutant strain. He said: ""The most important thing we can all do is to get a jab. While much about this new variant remains uncertain, we do know that two jabs does not give you enough protection against catching Omicron. ""You need that booster to bolster your immune system and to protect yourself and your family."" Despite the good news, Wales and Northern Ireland were yesterday plunged into further restrictions from Boxing Day — with the Prime Minister urged not to follow down that path yet. Research by Prof Neil Ferguson and Prof Azra Ghani at Imperial College put the hospital risk at between 30 and 50 per cent lower. They said jabs are critical, too. Prof Ferguson added: ""This is good news. Alpha was more severe than the wild virus we had before and Delta was more severe again. ""We might be getting back to what we saw with Alpha or even the wild type last year. ""The issue is that if there are enough patients, it still poses a challenge to the NHS. ""We're not talking about anything like what we saw last year with overflowing intensive care units and ventilator beds. But the sheer demand of numbers can be challenging."" A study by Edinburgh University estimated that under-60s are up to two thirds less likely to be admitted to hospital with Omicron. Researchers said a booster jab appears to slash the risk of getting ill by 57 per cent compared to two doses — bolstering the case for the top-ups. Prof Ferguson added: ""We see that even if you do become a case but you're vaccinated, you have a lower risk of being hospitalised than if you're unvaccinated. ""If you're infected with Delta after two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, you have a certain risk of being hospitalised — and we think the risk is about the same if you're infected with Omicron. ""We think Omicron is less severe but the reason your risk is the same is because the vaccines are slightly less effective, which is what we expected."" The scientists stress the figures are early data but both studies found the variant is milder — and the UK Health Security Agency is set to back it up today. Half the level of severity means cases would have to rise twice as high to reach the same level of hospital admissions compared with Delta. But there is a very real risk they will because the strain is taking over three to four times faster than Delta did in the spring. But on the back of the good data rising-star Tory MP Greg Smith told The Sun: ""Wales and Scotland have completely jumped the gun with positive data coming out of South Africa and London. ""We need to keep putting our eggs in the vaccine basket. ""I really hope the PM will not make any rushed decisions now and hold off until after Christmas before even considering any further measures."" Revellers were warned against sending New Year's Eve invitations just yet in case party-pooping restrictions are needed. Care Minister Gillian Keegan told them: ""There is uncertainty. So if you can't change your plans quickly, then maybe think about it. ""We can't predict what the data is going to tell us before we've got the data."" Health Secretary Sajid Javid refused to rule out further restrictions again yesterday, saying: ""The best advice is continue to remain cautious… no new restrictions before Christmas, and beyond that we will keep the situation under review."" The PM will continue poring over key hospital data that could make or break his decision to pull the trigger on a post-Christmas tightening after the weekend. If the NHS risks being swamped with Omicron he could return to Step 2 measures like outdoor pints. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon welcomed the figures and tweeted: ""This is encouraging early data. Hopefully confidence will build as we get more. ""Key point to remember though — a smaller percentage of a much larger number of cases will still put increased pressure on NHS and economy. So we must keep suppressing virus while we complete boosters."" But Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford tried to turn the screw on Boris by unveiling a Boxing Day toughening of the rules. The hated Rule of Six will return for pubs, restaurants and cinemas in Wales and large events will be banned. Labour's Mr Drakeford accused the PM of dithering and claimed he was hostage to Cabinet concerns about more restrictions. He said: ""They are paralysed by their internal divisions and are unable to act on it."" Mr Drakeford insisted he and the PM had the same data but only one had acted. He added: ""I heard the Prime Minister earlier this week say the position had never been more urgent. ""Asked what he was going to do about it, he said that he was doing nothing. Well, that would not be acceptable to me."" Last night Tony Blair rowed back from earlier comments in which he branded vaccine refuseniks as ""irresponsible idiots"" whose actions would allow the new variant to rip through Britain. Following a backlash ex-PM Mr Blair admitted he had been too ""undiplomatic"" in his language. HESITANT Brits of all ages are coming forward in their thousands to get jabbed for the first time as Omicron surges, NHS figures show. Around one in ten over-18s are still unvaccinated against Covid. But in England, 102,891 adults had their first dose this past week. And 227,596 have joined the jabbed club since the start of the month. Even 3,177 over-70s, who have been eligible for a year, got their first vaccine between December 15 and 21. They were joined by 24,395 people in their 40s, 50s and 60s — along with 75,409 aged from 18 to 39. NHS England's Dr Nikki Kanani said: ""Vaccines offer the best protection against coronavirus and there is no reason not to get them. ""So give yourself the gift of the jab this Christmas. It is never too late to come forward."" Meanwhile, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, left, said getting a jab is morally the right thing to do and suggested Jesus would do so. He said: ""It's not about me and my right to choose. ""It's about how I love my neighbour. It reduces my chances of getting ill and infecting others."""
1,1,The Sun,Harry Cole,Migrants could be electronically tagged to deter people from crossing Channel,"CHANNEL migrants could be electronically tagged when they land in Britain, we can reveal. The tough new measure aims to crack down on black market work and deter people from making the dangerous crossing. It is being drawn up as ministers have privately accepted there is no short-term fix to the influx of small boats. Economic migrants and asylum seekers of working age would be electronically tagged and subject to restrictions on their movements while their applications to stay in Britain are processed. Plans being drawn up between the Home Office and a new Cabinet Office taskforce to tackle the issue are also looking at the possibility of curfews. It is thought that more than a million illegal immigrants are currently working in Britain, meaning many more prefer to come here rather than stay in the EU where ID cards are required for jobs. Last month France's interior minister Gerald Darmanin said that Britain must ""limit its economic attractiveness"". He insisted Paris would not be ""held hostage"" and called for a clampdown on illegal workers in the UK. He previously suggested migrants are ""attracted by England, especially the labour market which means you can work in England without any identification"". Yesterday a Home Office source said the proposal was ""a low cost, high impact way to make changes quickly"". The source said the tag plan was ""in part to stop the pull factor, and part to stop people absconding while their claims to stay are being processed"". They added: ""Illegal entry isn't a punishment-free crime. Tagging will make it quicker and easier to deport those who have no right to be here."" It has been a record year for small boat crossings. More than 27,000 people have so far reached the UK from France compared to around 8,000 last year. On Monday, authorities rescued or intercepted 82 people on three boats while the French stopped 86 on four boats. Another 82 tried to cross on Tuesday and more than 100 yesterday. Tom Pursglove, minister for tackling illegal migration, said: ""The Nationality and Borders Bill will make it a criminal offence to knowingly arrive in the UK illegally and introduce life sentences for those who facilitate illegal entry."""
2,2,The Sun,Harry ColeSam BlanchardJack Elsom,"Boris will NOT announce any lockdown restrictions before Christmas, as new data shows Omicron IS weaker","BORIS Johnson will not announce any lockdown restrictions before Christmas Day - as new data shows the Omicron variant IS weaker. Downing Street was spurred on by new glimmers of hope after it emerged the mutant strain is less lethal and powerless against jabs. Two bombshell UK studies tonight revealed Omicron appears half as likely to put people in hospital as the Delta variant. The findings, announced by Professor Neil Ferguson - dubbed Prof Lockdown - encouraged the PM to delay any announcements of potential restrictions. He said vaccines remain our best defence against Covid, while those who have previously been infected will also have some immunity. But the PM confirmed that just two jabs are not enough to fight the new mutant strain saying: ""The most important thing we can all do is to get a jab."" Despite the good news, Wales and Northern Ireland have been plunged into further restrictions from Boxing Day - with the PM urged not to follow down that path for England just yet. Instead, he has urged Brits to get boosted now, making it more vital than ever for vaccine volunteers to sign up to The Sun's Jabs Army campaign. Mr Johnson said: ""While much about this new variant remains uncertain, we do know that two jabs does not give you enough protection against catching Omicron. ""You need that booster to bolster your immune system and to protect yourself and your family."" Brits have been warned not to make plans for New Year's Eve quite yet - after  daily confirmed cases passed the 100,000 total for the first time in the pandemic. Of those, 13,581 cases were of the Omicron strain. Mr Johnson added: ""This Christmas, I urge Sun readers and everyone across the UK to take extra special care to protect yourselves and your families against Covid. ""The Omicron variant continues to surge across the country faster than anything we have seen before. ""So please keep following the guidance, remembering to wear a mask when needed, open the windows for ventilation, and take a test before visiting your nearest and dearest, particularly if they are elderly or vulnerable."" But on the back of the good data rising star Tory MP Greg Smith told The Sun: ""Wales and Scotland have completely jumped the gun with positive data coming out of South Africa and London. ""We need to keep putting our eggs in the vaccine basket. We need to keep putting our eggs in the vaccine basket. ""I really hope the PM will not make any rushed decisions now and hold off until after Christmas before even considering any further measures."" Revellers were today warned against sending New Year's Eve invites just yet in case there is a need for party-pooping restrictions. Millions are desperate to end 2021 with a big blow-out and are praying the PM doesn't drop bombshell circuit-breaker curbs. But they were kept in limbo as Care Minister Gillian Keegan told them not to bank on firm arrangements. She said: ""There is uncertainty. So if you can't change your plans quickly, then maybe think about it. ""We can't predict what the data is going to tell us before we've got the data."" The Health Secretary Sajid Javid refused to rule out further restrictions again yesterday, instead just saying: ""The best advice is continue to remain cautious… no new restrictions before Christmas and beyond that we will just keep the situation under review."" The PM will continue pouring over key hospital data that could make or break his decision to pull the trigger on a post-Christmas tightening after the weekend. If the NHS risks being swamped with Omicron he could catapult the country back to Step 2 measures like outdoor pints. But Ms Keegan said evidence of Omicron's severity was the ""missing piece"" of information Ministers had been waiting for. Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford today turned the screw on Boris by unveiling a Boxing Day toughening of the rules. The hated Rule of Six will return for pubs, restaurants and cinemas in Wales and large events will be banned. Labour's Drakeford has been ridiculed for daft rules which fine £60 people for going to the office - but not the pub. The First Minister also took a pop shot at the PM, accusing him of dithering and claimed he was hostage to Cabinet concerns about more restrictions. Taking a swing at the press conference he blasted: ""They are paralysed by their internal divisions and are unable to act on it."" Dressing down the PM, Mr Drakeford insisted they both had the same data - but only one of them had acted. He said: ""I heard the Prime Minister earlier this week in an interview say the position had never been more urgent. ""And asked what he was going to do about it, he said that he was doing nothing. Well, that would not be acceptable to me."" Meanwhile Tony Blair last night rowed back from branding those who have not had a jab ""irresponsible idiots"" who are almost certainly going to catch Covid. Lashing out at refuseniks who turned down their life-saving jabs, the ex-PM insisted they were unprotected and were set to get the new super-contagious variant ripping through Britain. And Brits should gear up for a fourth jab next year to keep their immunity up, he stressed. But last night he said he had been too ""undiplomatic"" in his language following a backlash."
3,3,The Sun,Harry ColeJack ElsomJonathan Reilly,Boris Johnson tells Brits Christmas is ON – but New Year’s Eve looks doomed as Omicron cases soar,"CHRISTMAS can go ahead lockdown free, Boris Johnson declared last night — but New Year's Eve looks doomed. After 48 hours of confusion and a Cabinet backlash, the PM finally confirmed that no new Covid restrictions will be brought in before the festive weekend. But as the Omicron variant continued to surge, he warned that ""the situation remains finely balanced"". The threat of more curbs loomed as Mr Johnson said ""we cannot rule out further measures after Christmas"". Pubs could be forced to serve outside and indoor mixing capped as soon as next Tuesday. Downing Street insiders refused to rule out tougher rules immediately after the weekend. Mr Johnson urged families holding festive get togethers to protect granny and grandpa from Covid by leaving windows open to ""keep fresh air circulating"". Comic Matt Lucas famously lampooned the PM's dithering on TV's Great British Bake Off in the early stages of the first lockdown. Yesterday's announcement means that Boxing Day football will go ahead with crowds in England — unlike in Scotland where games will be limited to 500 fans. It came as it emerged that 90 per cent of Covid patients in hospital intensive care units are unvaccinated. Yesterday confirmed cases of the new more infectious strain dipped slightly. Another 90,629 were reported along with 172 deaths. No10 is on red alert for the NHS being overwhelmed in the coming weeks. Mr Johnson will mull over new hospital data before making a decision on what measures may be needed. The PM could yet announce plans for restrictions before this weekend — but time has run out to get them voted on and introduced before early next week. He is considering casting Britain back to the dark days of last spring's Step 2 curbs — where pints were only allowed outdoors and indoor mixing was banned. Parliament could be recalled as soon as December 28, after Mr Johnson promised MPs would get a say on any new measures. Cabinet ministers last night fanned fears of a so-called short ""circuit-breaker"" lockdown following a decision on Monday to hold off any imminent curbs. Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced £1billion in new support for pubs and restaurants yesterday but said there was ""an enormous amount of uncertainty"" around the coming weeks. The PM said in a video message: ""Naturally we can't rule out any further measures after Christmas — and we're going to keep a constant eye on the data, and we'll do whatever it takes to protect public health."" Yesterday Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon heaped further pressure on Mr Johnson to tighten rules as she unveiled a draconian Boxing Day clampdown on football fans, pubs and socialising north of the border. And in a New Year's Eve blow, Edinburgh's Hogmanay events were also cancelled. Clubbers in Scotland will have to dance socially distanced at least a metre apart under barmy new guidance. Meanwhile, one of Britain's leading medics, ex-Sage adviser Sir Jeremy Farrar said he believed the PM was right to wait for the data."
4,4,The Sun,Jack ElsomHarry ColeJonathan Reilly,Don’t send out New Year’s Eve party invites yet minister warns in biggest hint circuit breaker coming after Christmas,"DON'T plan a New Year's Eve party unless you can cancel at the last minute, a minister warned today. Care Minister Gillian Keegan dealt a blow for those hoping to toast in 2022 with a big bash by urging revellers to think carefully before sending out invites this early. Fears are mounting of a post-Christmas circuit-breaker that could ban indoor mixing and force pubs to serve pints outdoors. Boris Johnson last night confirmed he will not impose more restrictions before December 25 but ruled nothing out afterwards to tackle Omicron. While the announcement came as a relief to millions preparing to see family and friends, Brits are also crying out for clarity about New Years Eve plans. Asked if hosts should start making arrangements, Ms Keegan told LBC: ""There is uncertainty. So if you can't change your plans quickly, then maybe think about it. ""But there is uncertainty, we can't predict what the data is going to tell us before we've got the data. ""We're trying to take a balanced and proportionate approach so that people could see their families over Christmas to try and plan some stuff"" The threat of more curbs loomed as Mr Johnson said ""we cannot rule out further measures after Christmas"". Downing Street insiders refused to rule out tougher rules immediately after the weekend. Mr Johnson urged families holding festive get togethers to protect granny and grandpa from Covid by leaving windows open to ""keep fresh air circulating"".

5,5,The Sun,Jack ElsomHarry Cole,Boris Johnson confirms Christmas is ON and no new restrictions yet – but new rules loom after Boxing Day,"BORIS Johnson tonight declared Christmas is ON - but warned of a Boxing Day hangover as more restrictions could eventually follow. In a sigh of relief to millions preparing to celebrate with friends and family, the PM confirmed no new measures would be imposed before December 25. He said that while the outbreak of Omicron ""remains extremely difficult"" it did not warrant tougher curbs just yet. But New Year's Eve parties are on the brink as the PM once again stressed he ""will be ready to take action"" afterwards if the situation spirals out of control. The PM is believed to be considering casting Britain back into Step 2 curbs that would ban indoor mixing and force drinkers to have pints outside. It is understood the PM could announce a post-festive squeeze for as early as December 27 in the next 48 hours. Yet tonight Mr Johnson implored Brits to get boosted, urging them to ""drop everything"" and go to a walk-in centre or book online. His clarion call makes it more vital than ever for vaccine volunteers to sign up to The Sun's Jabs Army campaign. In key developments: In a video message posted to Twitter tonight, Mr Johnson cautiously broke the good news. He said: ""There is no doubt that Omicron continues to surge with a speed unlike anything we've seen before. ""The situation remains extremely difficult but I also recognise that people have been waiting to hear whether their Christmas plans are going to be affected. ""So what I can say tonight, is that naturally we can't rule out any further measures after Christmas - and we're going to keep a constant eye on the data, and we'll do whatever it takes to protect public health. ""But in view of the continuing uncertainty about several things – the severity of Omicron, uncertainty about the hospitalisation rate or the impact of the vaccine rollout or the boosters, we don't think today that there is enough evidence to justify any tougher measures before Christmas."" While he gave the green light for people to press ahead with plans, the PM urged them to do it cautiously. Mr Johnson's announcement means Boxing Day football will be able to go ahead with crowds in England, unlike in Scotland where they will be limited to 500 fans. While Christmas and Boxing Day are safe from being blighted by restrictions, Downing Street insiders refused to rule out tougher rules immediately after the weekend. Mr Johnson could yet announce plans for restrictions ahead of the Christmas weekend, but time has run out to get them voted on and introduced before early next week. He will spend tomorrow mulling over new hospitalisation data before making a decision on what measures may be needed next week. But with the House of Commons requiring a minimum of 24 hours to be recalled and a day to legislate on new regulations, Christmas Day plans and crucial Boxing Day football fixtures are safe from legally enforced lockdown measures on crowds being capped. Cabinet Ministers today fanned fears of a circuit-breaker following their decision yesterday to hold off announcing any imminent restrictions. Rishi Sunak said there was ""an enormous amount of uncertainty"" around Christmas plans and could not rule anything out. Asked if he could rule out restrictions before the New Year, the Chancellor said: ""I absolutely appreciate people's frustration with all of this. ""And I'd refer people to the Prime Minister's words yesterday. And unfortunately, we're just dealing with an enormous amount of uncertainty at the moment. ""And what the Prime Minister said is that we're reviewing the data day by day, hour by hour, keeping the situation under constant review that can't rule anything out."" Cabinet Office Minister Steve Barclay also said ministers were ""looking closely at the data"" before deciding whether to pull the trigger on a circuit-breaker. Make-or-break modelling from top Government advisers is also expected as soon as today to force the PM to take action. Nicola Sturgeon this afternoon heaped pressure on Mr Johnson to tighten the rules as she unveiled a Boxing Day clampdown in Scotland. Fans will no longer be allowed into stadiums and pubs must revert to table service after December 26. No more than three households will be able to sit in a group. Meanwhile Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, is briefing Tory MPs on the latest Omicron evidence tonight. Mr Johnson fears a massive backbench revolt against more restrictions could once again leave him in the fragile position of relying on Labour. They'll be shown the most recent SAGE minutes which warn that ""more stringent measures would need to be implemented very soon"". Firing a warning shot across the PM's bow, ex-Cabinet Minister Esther McVey said  people shouldn't be cowed by ""scaremongering by the lockdown fanatics"". Hospitality bosses also demanded to know the plan so they could decide whether or not to order supplies. Strict guidance to limit gatherings has taken a wrecking ball to businesses' golden Christmas trading period and seen December profits tank by 60 per cent. The Chancellor unveiled a bumper £1billion package to stop hospitality venues going to the wall after suffering a flood of cancellations from cautious Brits. Following a clamour for help, Mr Sunak this afternoon announced one-off £6,000 grants for 200,000 hospitality and leisure venues. Unfortunately, we're just dealing with an enormous amount of uncertainty More than £100million will be funnelled to local councils to use for other venues in need of emergency cash. He also said the Government would revive the Statutory Sick Pay scheme for staff forced to isolate as the super-variant threatens millions of absences. From today the Treasury will bankroll the £96.35 a week for workers forced to take time off with Covid. Bosses can make retrospective claims from mid-January. Labour's Pat McFadden fumed: ""The real question after yesterday's indecisive Cabinet meeting is what will happen next, when will the country be informed of that, and will support for businesses and workers be placed alongside any further public health measures that might be announced."" In a flicker of good news a top scientist today said Omicron ""isn't spreading as fast as doomsday predictions suggest"". Cambridge professor Sir David Spiegelhalter claims that overall admissions to hospital should remain manageable - as the rate ""isn't looking quite as bad"" as once thought. And Sir Jeremy Farrar, a former member of Sage, said: ""Omicron is spreading unbelievably fast. It is a phenomenal variant transmission. ""There is great uncertainty about what is it going to lead to in terms of pressure on the health system, people going to hospital, particularly people dying, but also what impact is it going to have on the broader society, staff absences, the ability to have functioning other services, so there is great uncertainty. ""My personal view is that I think we can wait at the moment until there are more restrictions formally placed."""
6,6,The Sun,Harry ColeKate Ferguson,Brits holding their breath as Boris Johnson warns he could slap Covid restrictions on Christmas at any moment,"ANXIOUS families and businesses were in limbo last night after Boris Johnson warned he could slap Covid restrictions on Christmas at any moment. The PM said he ""will rule nothing out"" in the fight against Omicron, following a testy virtual Cabinet meeting. The Queen has called off her Christmas gathering at Sandringham for a second year but Premier League chiefs refused to cancel festive fixtures — despite Covid ravaging teams. As Mr Johnson mulled over a cap on indoor mixing and forcing pubs to only serve outside, there was a ray of hope for celebrations as booster jabs hit the million-a-day target. The PM said he must ""reserve the possibility"" of festive restrictions for a second year running. But he warned he ruled nothing out in the coming days if incoming data showed mutant Covid risked overwhelming the NHS. That left millions in limbo over festive travel plans and desperate pub landlords begging last night to be told how much beer to order for the coming weeks. Yesterday, Tory big beasts including Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss and Kwarsi Kwarteng resisted new restrictions without clearer data on the surging Omicron variant and the threat to hospitals. But Health Secretary Sajid Javid, Levelling Up boss Michael Gove and Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries spoke in favour of tougher action. Sore from the resignation of his key ally Lord Frost last week over Covid measures, Mr Johnson gave his top team the chance to air their views — admitting afterwards their opinions were ""finely balanced"". One source said: ""Sajid has woken up to the reality of the situation and anyone who remembers last year from the front line knows you have to act quick."" But an ally of the Foreign Secretary told The Sun Ms Truss is ""deeply uncomfortable"" with any further measures coming in and wants ""incontrovertible evidence that they are needed and would work"". The source said: ""The gap between the data we have now and what we need to see to make this decision is still massive."" After the meeting, the PM admitted: ""There are still some things that we need to be clearer about before we decide to go further."" Speaking in No10, he said: ""We agreed that we should keep the data from now on under constant review, keep following it, hour by hour. ""And unfortunately we will have to reserve the possibility of taking further action to protect the public and to protect public health and to protect our NHS. And we won't hesitate to take that action. We will rule nothing out."" No10 is waiting for new data from Imperial College London, which will shed more light on the severity of Omicron, to arrive tomorrow before making a final call. Mr Johnson is also hoping to avoid a lockdown for as long as possible after encouraging data reveals Brits are self-policing and reining in their mixing far more than expected. But leaked SAGE minutes warned that ""more stringent measures would need to be implemented very soon"" and a slew of scientists hit the airwaves again yesterday to demand restrictions immediately. The PM has promised to give MPs a vote on any new restrictions before they come into force - meaning a recall of Parliament. But hopes are rising that the window to do so is now too narrow to ruin Christmas - but puts New Year's Eve celebrations into serious doubt. THOUSANDS of shoppers pack the streets in the search for last- minute gifts — as the threat from Omicron gets worse by the day. Regent Street in London's West End was rammed — just as PM Boris Johnson was meeting experts to discuss the possibility of introducing tighter restrictions. Elsewhere, Terminal 5 at Heathrow was filled with passengers getting away for the festive season. And in Soho, in central London, drinkers enjoyed a few pints while they were able to — as landlords warned they did not know how much beer to buy in as they were left in lockdown limbo. The restrictions discussed include a return to the Rule of Six, and similar measures during Step 2 of Lockdown lifting last April that saw boozers serving outdoors only but shops and gyms open. However there was fury after officials admitted they have not modelled the economic impact of more Covid restrictions. The Sun understands that Whitehall insiders looking at imposing curbs on pubs and socialising have not analysed the devastating impact it could have on the economy. One insider said: ""It has been two years since Covid first struck and they still aren't doing the analysis."" Tory MP and former leader Iain Duncan Smith fumed: ""It looks like this is all one sided Sage advice pushing for lockdown - it is not weighed against the economic fallout it causes."" And angry pub landlords demanded the PM tell them how much beer to order, as the PM failed to rule out forcing punters outdoors and capping indoor mixing. Businesses are begging the PM not to tighten the rules in their crucial Christmas period for a second year running. Desperate pubs last night warned they do not know how much beer to buy in as they are left in lockdown ""limbo"". Anxious boozers and restaurants have seen their lucrative Christmas takings fall off a cliff - and fear New Year's Eve could be wrecked too if new restrictions are imposed. They begged Chancellor Rishi Sunak to cough up some bailout cash to see them through the bleak Omicron winter. Kate Nicholls, boss of UK Hospitality, said: ""Businesses are dying on their feet. They are stuck in limbo. ""The continued uncertainty is hanging over businesses and people are voting with their feet. We have seen cancellations all the way through to April. We need financial support."" Many restaurants have decided to cut their losses and close early for Christmas as punters stay away. While others have been forced to close because of Omicron outbreaks. Pubs and restaurants have been contacting their local MPs begging them for clarity so they know how much cash to spend buying food, beer and wine. Tory MP and Red Wall poster girl Dehenna Davison said: ""In the last two days, I've had pubs and restaurants contact me asking if they should place food and drinks orders. ""I've had emails from people asking if they should postpone their wedding for the fifth time, or if they can see their mum on Christmas."" Speaking after the Cabinet meeting yesterday, Mr Johnson admitted this December has been a torrid time for Britain's pubs. He said: ""No one wanted this to go this way - Omicron has exploded so fast we have seen people naturally deciding to protect themselves. ""We will keep the economic side of this under review as well."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is holding a series of emergency calls with business and hospitality chefs today as the clamour for a bailout grows louder. The Treasury is expected to come up with a package for struggling pubs, clubs and other areas of hospitality if new restrictions are imposed. They are considering handing out grants to help hammered businesses weather the Omicron storm. But No11 is so far resisting industry pressure to extend the VAT and business rates tax cuts - which would cost billions of pounds more. The scale of any bailout package will hinge on how severe any lockdown restrictions are, and how long they last. The delay in restrictions delighted some Tory MPs like Esther McVey, Conservative MP for Tatton, who tweeted ""Pleased the Cabinet and PM are now listening to their backbench MPs and for once pushed back on the scaremongering by the lockdown fanatics. ""It seems the 100 strong backbench rebellion last week has made a difference."" But last night Labour said: ""Boris Johnson is too weak to stand up to his own backbenchers, many of whom have no plan beyond 'let the virus rip'. ""Today, while businesses across the country wonder if they can continue to trade, and families make frantic calls about whether they will see each other this Christmas, true to form the Prime Minister has put his party before the public. THE Queen has decided not to hold a big family Christmas because of the threat from Omicron — but will not spend the day completely alone. The 95-year-old monarch yesterday made a personal decision not to travel to Sandringham for the second year. Palace aides had hoped she would fly to her Norfolk home to be with family for her first Christmas since husband Prince Philip's death eight months ago. Instead, she has chosen to stay at Windsor but royal sources say she will not be alone as members of her family will drop in on Christmas Day. They are expected to include Princess Anne, Princes Charles, Andrew, Edward and William and Princess Eugenie. A royal insider said: ""There was no way they could safely move her whole court from Windsor to Sandringham. It's just too much of a risk when you also think of all the extra staff you would have to bring into Sandringham and all of the extra members of the family coming and going. ""Family will be dropping by but they just haven't sorted out who and when yet. It's now highly unlikely she will even go to Sandringham at all this winter."" Royal insiders say the decision to cancel Sandringham was taken by the Queen herself and the Government was then told of her plans. It comes with millions of families across the country now reassessing their Christmas plans amid rocketing Covid infections. A Palace spokesman said: ""Her Majesty has decided to celebrate Christmas at Windsor and will not travel to Sandringham. ""The decision was a personal one after careful consideration and reflects a precautionary approach. ""There will be family visiting Windsor over the Christmas period and all appropriate guidelines will be followed."" The rise of the Omicron variant also saw the Queen cancel a lunch with up to 50 members of her extended family at Windsor. It was initially thought to be part of a wider plan to ensure a big Christmas at Sandringham could go ahead safely. A senior palace source said last week: ""The decision is a precautionary one as it's felt to put too many people's Christmas arrangements at risk if it went ahead. ""While there is regret that it's cancelled, there is belief it's the right thing to do for all concerned."" Her Majesty has been on light duties since spending a night in hospital two months ago. She had to pull out of several major engagements following medical advice. She also missed Remembrance Sunday after spraining her back. But last week she was spotted on her feet and ""back to her best"" on a secret trip to London. PREMIER League bosses have vowed to keep playing matches over Christmas — despite several teams being hit by Covid. Clubs yesterday decided against a festive break following a number of games being called off — and they unanimously voted against postponing the season. Liverpool had proposed moving a round of fixtures but, despite support from other clubs, the idea was rejected as too complex. Last weekend, six of the ten Premier League matches were cancelled, with Manchester United, Leicester and Aston Villa among those to suffer outbreaks. The Premier League said: ""It was confirmed at a meeting today that, while recognising a number of clubs are experiencing Covid-19 outbreaks and challenges, it is the league's collective intention to continue the current fixture schedule where safely possible. ""The health and well-being of all remains our priority and the league will continue to monitor and reflect public health guidance, always proceeding with caution."" As Wolves players got their jabs, it was also revealed only 77 per cent of players had been double jabbed, while 84 per cent had at least one dose. The Premier League added: ""The league continues to work with clubs to encourage vaccination among players and club staff, as well as promoting the Government's public-health vaccination messaging to clubs and the wider public."" The English Football League also confirmed on Monday that its competitions, including this week's League Cup quarter-finals, would proceed as planned. But the Football Association scrapped FA Cup replays for the third and fourth round to help avoid a fixture pile-up. Earlier this month the Government announced fans had to show vaccine passports to enter games. But further restrictions are expected and may force games to be played behind closed doors. England midfielder Jude Bellingham, 18, yesterday encouraged other players to get the jab after revealing he has had the booster. He plays for Germany's Borussia Dortmund, where 94 per cent of players are double jabbed. He said: ""I've had both jabs and the booster, just to be safe. ""I don't want to be passing anything on to my family and be having to miss games myself."" England manager Gareth Southgate said on vaccinations: ""The only way through it is to fight the virus collectively. We all have that responsibility to think of other people as well as ourselves."" Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel had led criticism from clubs on the outbreaks, with the Blues ""deeply disappointed"" to have their request for a postponement at Wolves on Sunday rejected. Brentford boss Thomas Frank had called for a firebreak pause on the league action last week, with Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp adding his support."
7,7,The Sun,Jack ElsomHarry Cole,Boris Johnson warns he won’t hesitate to act & is reviewing ‘extremely difficult’ situation every HOUR,"BORIS Johnson tonight warned he ""reserves the possibility"" to impose fresh Covid restrictions - but is not pulling the trigger just yet. After a marathon three-hour emergency Cabinet meeting the PM announced he would be reviewing the ""extremely difficult"" situation hour by hour. Top docs this afternoon presented Cabinet with sobering stats about the super-strain's rapid spread that risks swamping hospitals. Following the meeting Mr Johnson warned that the ""explosion"" of Omicron was a wake-up call for Brits to get their booster jabs NOW. Volunteers are signing up in droves to help out the campaign effort including the heroic recruits of The Sun's Jabs Army. And the PM dropped the strongest hint yet more restrictions could be needed to battle the rising tide of Omicron infections. Speaking in No10 he said: ""We agreed that we should keep the data from now on under constant review, keep following it, hour by hour. ""And unfortunately, I must say to people - we will have to reserve the the possibility of taking further action to protect the public and to protect public health and to protect our NHS. ""And we won't hesitate to take that action."" In major developments: Mr Johnson said the arguments in Cabinet for and against more measures were ""finely balanced"". The Sun revealed today that the PM delayed announcing more curbs after Cabinet demanded clearer data before imposing measures that would hammer business. Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng are believed to be among the voices afraid of the impact on the economic recovery by rushing through curbs. Granting a concession to Cabinet hawks, Mr Johnson said: ""In view of the balance of risks and uncertainties, particularly around the infection, hospitalisation rate of Omicron - how many people does Omicron put in hospital - and some other uncertainties to do with the severity, the effectiveness and so on we agreed that we should keep the data from now on under constant review."" Angry Tory MPs are also gearing up to rebel and warn more than 100 of them will vote against any more restrictions. Mr Johnson has vowed to give Parliament a say on any new measures, meaning his time is running out for a tightening before Christmas. Rebel ringleader Mark Harper demanded clarity from the Government over their plans for future restrictions. He said: ""Not telling the public what's going on is unacceptable. These are big decisions affecting everyone's lives, people's livelihoods and mental wellbeing across the country."" Ex-Cabinet Minister Esther McVey tweeted: ""Pleased the Cabinet and PM (recognising where majority opinion is in Parliamentary Party) are now listening to their backbench MPs & for once pushed back on the scaremongering by the lockdown fanatics. ""It seems the 100 strong backbench rebellion last week has made a difference."" Red Waller Dehenna Davison said people in her Bishop Aukland seat were crying out for clarity on whether their Christmas plans were safe. Businesses are begging the PM not to tighten the rules in their crucial Christmas period for a second year running. One fearful shop owner earlier said on LBC he was ""trembling"" at the prospect of another golden trading period going to the wall. But the PM is being pulled the other way by gloomy scientists and politicians demanding a toughening of rules. Leaked SAGE minutes warned that ""more stringent measures would need to be implemented very soon"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan are also calling for immediate action. One government source hit back: ""Either we trust the vaccines work or we don't. We need to move from pandemic to endemic. To save Christmas, SAGE needs stuffing."" There is speculation Mr Johnson could catapult Britain back to the Dark Ages of last spring - with outdoor pints and the rule of six. In a Groundhog Day nightmare the PM is believed to be considering a temporary return to the Step 2 measures enforced from April to May to tackle Omicron. Labour's shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said: """"Rather than set out a clear plan for the country, he has chosen to protect himself from his own MPs by simply not saying anything. Boris Johnson is unfit to lead."""
8,8,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson warned by MPs he is drinking in last-chance saloon after huge by-election defeat,"PM Boris Johnson has been warned he is drinking in the last-chance saloon after his party's huge by-election defeat. The Conservatives lost the once ultra-safe seat of North Shropshire for the first time in 200 years in the wake of sleaze scandals and Christmas party rows. Jubilant Liberal Democrats wiped out the 23,000 majority to seize the seat with their own 6,000 margin after it was vacated by the disgraced ex-Cabinet Minister Owen Paterson. Lib Dem candidate Helen Morgan took the seat with 17,957 votes, pushing Tory Neil Shastri-Hurst into second place on 12,032 — with a 34 per cent swing against him. That is the fourth largest swing in a by-election in the past 30 years. The Tories' thumping was the seventh biggest upset in a by-election since World War Two. But the Prime Minister took ""full responsibility"" for the defeat and vowed to kick-start his faltering Downing Street operation after weeks of torrid headlines and scandals. He acknowledged he needed to fix the anger over No10 parties and the controversy of his Downing Street refurbishment. But he insisted a ""constant litany of stuff about politics and politicians"" had overshadowed the Government's successes, such as the rapid roll-out of the Covid booster jab campaign. He told reporters: ""I've got to put my hands up and say, 'Have I failed to get that message across in the last few weeks? Has it been obscured by all this other stuff?' Yes, I'm afraid it has."" But last night Mr Johnson's Tory enemies spoke out to declare he was one strike away from being ousted. Devout Remainer Sir Roger Gale said: ""I think this has to be seen as a referendum on the Prime Minister's performance — and I think that the Prime Minister is now in last orders time."" The Kent MP added: ""One more strike and he's out."" Sir Charles Walker, vice-chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, said a leadership contest would be completely self-indulgent — but added Mr Johnson had a year at most to make a difference. He told Times Radio: ""The Prime Minister has got weeks, months, a year to sort himself out. If we go on making unforced errors over the next three to six months or nine months, it will become a lot more serious. It's serious now, but it's not at a critical level yet."" Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the treasurer of the 1922 Committee, said it was not the time for a ""big blame game"" but that Mr Johnson needed to stop the ""self-inflicted own goals"". However, it was not just the old guard who were calling for Mr Johnson to get a grip. North West Durham MP Richard Holden — who sensationally won the mining community for the Tories in 2019 — warned support for Mr Johnson was not unconditional. Boris faces a tough few months, with the soaring cost of living, threat of future Covid restrictions and biting tax rises next April. The PM's allies are braced for a leadership crisis after potentially painful local elections in May. The Tories hit a historic high in council seats last fought in 2019 under then PM Theresa May. But they risk of losing thousands of council seats next spring at a time described as the ""moment of maximum danger"" for the PM. This has to be seen as a referendum on the Prime Minister's performance — and I think that the Prime Minister is now in last orders time. Last night, ex-Scottish Tory leader Baroness Ruth Davidson — a long standing critic of the PM — said he was drinking in the last chance saloon and had been ""put on warning by his MPs"". She said the party was looking for him to sharpen the operation at No10. And she warned it was time ""for a bit of bloody grip to be exerted"" if he wanted to stay in Downing Street."
9,9,The Sun,Harry Cole,No10 probe into Christmas lockdown parties collapses into farce as inquiry boss quits after his own staff had bash,"DOWNING Street's probe into Christmas lockdown breaking collapsed into farce last night as the chief inquisitor QUIT after it emerged his own staff had a party last December. Cabinet Secretary Simon Case stepped down from investigating the slew of allegations that No10 staff flouted lockdown rules by boozing and playing party games last Christmas. Boris Johnson had tasked Whitehall's most senior civil servant to look into the claims, but last night they were hit by fresh allegations that Mr Case's own team had flouted Tier 3 rules last year. The Cabinet Office admitted that six members of his team had bought booze and snacks into the office on 17 December 2020 and took part in a virtual quiz with other colleagues from their desk. Email invites were sent in advance called it ""Christmas party!"" - coming the night before Mr Johnson's own team were accused of a boozy wine and cheese knees-up. Mr Case admitted he was aware of the social gathering that Labour claims appears to have broken the strict rules against social gatherings in place in London at the time. But the top mandarin denied other claims that a bigger party had taken place in his vast suite of offices in the heart of Whitehall. Last week Boris Johnson had tasked Mr Case with probing claims No10 staff had broken the rules. When asked if the Cabinet Secretary had been at any social gatherings, the PM's spokesman insisted: ""You can be assured due diligence will have been observed."" Last night one top minister branded the latest twist in the saga ""f***ing amateur hour."" Whitehall's former top sleazebuster Sue Gray was last night drafted in to take over the probe. The official served as head of the Government's ethics team for five years and has a fearsome reputation as a no-nonsense street-fighter. A statement said: ""To ensure the ongoing investigation retains public confidence the Cabinet Secretary has recused himself for the remainder of the process."" Labour said there was ""growing evidence of a culture of turning a blind eye to the rules."""
10,10,The Sun,Harry ColeKate FergusonJonathan Reilly,Brits face choice of parties in pub with mates or spending Christmas Day with their families as Omicron cases soar,"BORIS Johnson was last night accused of creating ""lockdown by stealth"" as millions stayed at home to save their Christmas. Pubs and restaurants are closing after punters were asked to choose between partying or keeping loved ones safe from Omicron. Last night's Premier League game between Leicester and Spurs was postponed along with five more over the weekend. A new high of 88,376 daily infections was recorded yesterday — but the Government said it will hit its target of a million booster jabs a day by the weekend. The PM insisted there are no plans for further restrictions before the holiday — despite the Omicron wave. Yet on Wednesday gloomy Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty called for limits on meeting friends. The mixed message appears to put the PM at odds with his leading experts. And it means millions have to weigh up a pint with pals — or Christmas at home with the in-laws in eight days' time. Yesterday there were signs Brits had declared a self-lockdown as towns and cities fell silent. Millions worked from home, roads were empty and public transport passenger numbers massively down. But some are determined to party on while they can. Brits could sink ten million pints for tonight's ""Black Eye Friday"" — the last big night out before Christmas. Oil rig worker Greg Wilson, 50, of Norfolk, said: ""All I'd say to Mr Whitty is, he should try having Christmas with my family. ""I'd feel a lot happier and safer in the pub with my mates."" Daily Covid cases in Britain rocketed to another record high yesterday with more than 88,000 people diagnosed in the past 24 hours. It marks a 74 per cent rise in a week and beat the previous record of 68,000 in January. Omicron is believed to be doubling every two days with testing struggling to keep up. Scientists fear the R-rate, the number each infected person infects, in some areas could be between 3 and 5 — far higher than previous Covid spreads. Around two million people could be self-isolating by Christmas Day if infection rates continue. Fifteen people are in hospital with the variant, but Prof Whitty warned the true figure will be much bigger. Tories yesterday accused the Chief Medical Officer of forcing England into an ""effective lockdown"". Former minister Steve Brine said in the Commons: ""There was no new policy announced then Professor Whitty answered a question from the BBC and at a stroke changed Government policy and put this country, certainly hospitality… into effective lockdown."" Tory MP Joy Morrissey accused Prof Whitty of turning England into a ""public health socialist state"". She later deleted the Twitter outburst. WHAT'S happening to daily cases and what is the true number? Case numbers are rising fast but may still only show part of the picture. Yesterday saw a record 88,376 infections but the true number could be much higher as only half of those who catch the virus get tested. IS Omicron milder? If so, why are hospitals at risk? Scientists still do not know. South Africa's data suggests the risk of hospital admission is up to 29 per cent lower but the country has a younger population and most of them have had Covid before. Even if infections are less deadly, hospitals are still at risk as the variant spreads so fast. WHAT is actually happening with hospital admissions? Only 20 admissions are confirmed or suspected to be Omicron — but the true number is higher. Many patients are still waiting for variant checks and hospital admissions lag about two weeks behind cases, meaning numbers will soon climb fast. In Omicron hot spot London, daily admissions have doubled in a fortnight to 200. Across England, hospital numbers are only creeping up but NHS bosses fear they will start to follow London within days. There are no known Omicron cases in intensive care yet. WHY won't the NHS be able to cope? Isn't it prepared? Hospitals have the flexibility to cope with Covid surges but they have to stop other work if numbers get too high — and a big outbreak will see staff getting sick. No10 slapped her down and said Prof Whitty was a ""hugely respected and trusted public servant"". Health Minister Gillian Keegan appeared to add to the confusion by telling Brits to sit ""spaced apart"". Boris Johnson denied imposing a lockdown ""by stealth"", saying: ""If you want to go to an event or a party, then the sensible thing to do is get a test and to make sure that you are being cautious. We are not saying that we want to cancel stuff."" But pubs and restaurants have already closed early. Many have faced cancellations while staff have caught Covid and had to isolate. The British Beer and Pub Association said boozers will sell 37million fewer pints, worth £297million in trade this year. Chancellor Rishi Sunak flew back early from California for crisis talks with hospitality chiefs desperate for a bailout. Daily deaths actually fell yesterday with 146 fatalities. Latest hospital data shows there were 849 admissions on December 12 but those figures lag around two weeks behind infection rates. Prof Whitty yesterday told MPs Omicron is spreading so quickly it could send daily admissions above the previous high of 4,500. He warned it could be 2023 before a universal jab is developed, meaning we will rely on restrictions and booster jabs until then."
11,11,The Sun,Nick McDermottHarry Cole,Brits urged to limit pub trips or risk Christmas as Covid cases soar to record high,"PEOPLE were last night urged to cut down on drinking with pals and colleagues if they want to see their family at Christmas — as Covid cases soared to a record high. Infections hit 78,610 confirmed cases yesterday — up more than 10,000 on January's peak. Omicron infections also nearly doubled overnight, leaping from 5,346 to 10,017. In the gloomiest No 10 briefing in months, Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty and a glum-looking Prime Minister urged people to ""prioritise social interactions that really matter to them"" or risk catching the mutant Omicron strain and missing Christmas. They said those choosing to party could help stop the spread with ""good ventilation, meeting outdoors and following sensible rules"". But hospitality firms called it a sledgehammer to the struggling industry at its busiest time of year. They called it a ""lockdown by the back door"" and said it was time for a bailout from the Chancellor. Furious MPs also called on Rishi Sunak to cough up or see businesses go under. Tory Anne Marie Morris said: ""If we're effectively telling people not to visit hospitality venues this Christmas, then this needs to be accompanied by immediate sector specific financial support from the Treasury."" Fears of an impending January lockdown were heightened dramatically as Prof Whitty warned there would be ""unpalatable choices"" to make in the coming weeks and Boris Johnson admitted he would be ""working through"" Christmas. Asked if it was time for more restrictions, Prof Whitty said: ""This is a really big threat at the moment. ""There are lots of things we don't know, but all the things we do know are bad."" Despite the PM insisting they are not telling Brits to cancel all their Christmas plans, Prof Whitty warned: ""Don't mix with people you don't have to either for work or for the sort of family things that really matter to you, would be my general advice but people have to make their own choices. ""You don't need a medical degree to realise that is a sensible thing to do with an incredibly infectious virus."" In the most downbeat assessment since lockdown was lifted earlier this year: The PM said we must ""keep giving Omicron both barrels"" by getting boosted this weekend. Aiming to nearly double yesterday's jabbing record to a million doses a day, Mr Johnson said: ""We're throwing everything at it. Wherever you are, we'll be there with a jab for you."" And he confirmed this weekend would see a massive pop-up vaccine drive with jabs being given in hospitals, surgeries, pharmacies, shopping centres, high streets. They will even be given in football stadiums such as Chelsea's Stamford Bridge and Elland Road in Leeds. It comes as footie fans were urged to ditch matches this weekend and get jabbed instead. Dr Nikki Kanani, director of primary care at NHS England, said: ""If you're going to go to a stadium at the weekend, make it one where you can get your vaccine or help out to give a vaccine, rather than going to watch a match."" The PM added: ""We're not cancelling events, we're not closing hospitality, we're not cancelling people's parties or their ability to mix. What we are saying is think carefully before you go."" Experts are predicting a massive surge in cases in the coming days, with NHS chiefs preparing for the biggest wave of hospital admissions yet. It could see thousands of operations cancelled to free up beds. Government scientists are now warning the NHS is at risk of being overwhelmed next month unless the spread can be slowed. Meanwhile, panicking parents are pulling their kids out of school before the end of term as anyone testing positive from now will have to be in isolation on Christmas Day. No 10 stressed children should be in school until the last day of term, with Mr Johnson urging parents and teens to get jabbed to keep learning in classrooms. But privately insiders admit there is little they can do to stop local authorities closing schools. PUBS suffered 3.2 million Christmas party cancellations last week — and fear this week will be worse. They say Boris Johnson's confusing lockdown by stealth means punters are being scared off while the hospitality sector is getting no financial help. One landlord said: ""It's pub purgatory — we are not being told to shut but the Government is telling Brits to stay away."" It is a devastating blow for boozers who only two weeks ago were set for a busy December, hoping to make up for lost trade earlier this year. This week and next are normally the busiest for the UK's 47,000 pubs. Landlords do not blame customers, who are staying away, but they are furious at confusing official messages. The British Beer and Pub Association used a snapshot survey to work out that last week pubs were hit with 750,000 cancellations on the busy Thursday and Friday. Over the week, the figure totalled 3.2 million. Celebrity chef Tom Kerridge had 654 cancellations in one of his restaurants in six days. Emma McClarkin, boss of the BBPA, said: ""We need a full package of financial support from the Government, from furlough to grants."""
12,12,The Sun,Harry ColeKate FergusonNatasha Clark,"Boris Johnson suffers his worst Tory rebellion with 100 of his MPs voting against him amid pub, shop & hospital warnings","BORIS Johnson was given a bloody nose in the Commons yesterday as 100 of his own MPs voted against his Omicron measures. His plans, which included mandatory vaccine passports for some large venues, were approved but opponents fear it is just a first step in pushing the country into a much harsher Plan C. It comes as doctors warned that the Covid variant could see pubs, shops and even hospitals hit by staff shortages within a month. Meanwhile, in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon wants to limit social gatherings to just three households before Christmas. She also brought in tougher visiting rules for care homes and said she would make it a legal duty for employers to ask staff to work from home. Mr Johnson had already suggested people work from home from Monday — leaving train and Tube carriages deserted. His battering in the Commons came after a series of votes on Plan B's other measures aimed at tackling the mutant strain of the virus. But it was particularly painful as it came just a few minutes after he had begged his backbenchers to support him and wake up to the scale of Omicron. At a testy private meeting of his MPs, the PM repeatedly insisted he did not want any further lockdown measures but warned they had to face up to the reality of a looming spike in Omicron cases. And he promised MPs they would get a vote in an emergency Christmas Commons recall if things became dramatically worse. But his pleas fell on deaf ears as almost half of his backbenchers voted against vaccine passports yesterday — the move only being passed thanks to Labour votes. Tory Geoffrey Clifton Brown said Mr Johnson needed to up his game as he was shocked at the major division within the party. He said: ""We all know what happens to disunited parties. It is going to involve a major change in the way that he does things."" Ahead of the vote, ministers and MPs were given doomsday warnings of a January of closures — even without a lockdown. In a bleak update to the Cabinet on Tuesday morning, the PM and Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty warned the new variant could lead to serious staff shortages across Britain. They told the meeting, held virtually for the first time in months, that things were looking very bad. The pair said that even the most conservative estimates suggested the virus would unleash a tidal wave of new cases and hospitalisations. It would mean hundreds of thousands of people forced off work and into isolation. Prof Whitty warned NHS workers faced being hospitalised themselves as Omicron peaked in January. Last night, No 10 denied suggestions that medics had warned that the number of isolating doctors and nurses could become so bad that some hospitals risked being closed. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned that infections may already have rocketed to 200,000 a day. But Covid expert Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter called it ""a bit naughty"" to say the figure was so high and suggested the true number was just a quarter of that. MPs fear No 10 is waiting for them to go home for Christmas on Thursday before plunging England back into a version of lockdown. Ministers are considering a slew of draconian restrictions should the spread of Omicron worsen. Discussions have included a return to the rule of six, the closure of pubs and hospitality, banning households mixing indoors or at all, and a return to social distancing. Schools could even be ordered to stay shut for all pupils apart from vulnerable children and those whose parents are essential workers. Former minister Sir Desmond Swayne accused the Government of developing a ""ministry of fear"" and leaving the hospitality sector in the gutter. He questioned which ""Stalinist minds"" had been let loose to ""twist the fear lever"" once again. Mark Harper, chairman of the Covid Recovery Group of MPs, said ministers had gone into panic mode and said those who thought this meant there would be no more restrictions were kidding themselves."
13,13,The Sun,Harry ColeKatie Davis,New Year’s Eve parties under threat as further plans to tackle Omicron drawn up by killjoy Whitehall officials,"NEW Year's Eve parties are in ""grave doubt"" as killjoy Whitehall officials are drawing up further plans to tackle the Omicron variant. There are growing fears of further restrictions being slapped on Brits after Christmas as the infection rate is expected to peak in January. The Sun has learnt Whitehall officials have drawn up plans to restrict numbers in pubs and restaurants and even close them down in the coming weeks. A government source told The Sun: ""You will be able to see your family at Christmas, but at this rate you might not be able to do it in a pub. ""As for New Year's Eve, that is a different story."" But MPs privately warn they will torpedo any attempts to bring in former restrictions like the Rule of Six or a ban on household mixing. It comes as more than one in five Tory MPs will vote against Boris Johnson on Tuesday as a brutal rebellion on vaccine passports hit 80. No10 vowed to crack on with the vote despite the PM's majority being wiped out - amid dire warnings of a bigger backlash at any attempt at ""Plan C"" restrictions. But Covid certification for nightclubs, mega-bars and stadiums is expected to sail through the Commons with the backing of Sir Keir Starmer's Labour. Data shows boosters offer up to 75 per cent protection from mild infection from Omicron, with The Sun relaunching our hugely successful Jabs Army campaign. One ex-Minister told The Sun that Tuesday night's vote is a ""show of force"". The number expected to rebel far outweighs the 56 MPs required to trigger a internal confidence vote in the PM - but falls short of the 181 needed to defeat him. The senior MP said: ""They may be able to get stuff through on Labour votes, but if they push things to far I have no doubt  it would be curtains."" Meanwhile leading Tory rebel Marcus Fysh was slammed after comparing the planned coronavirus health passes being introduced to limit the spread of Omicron to atrocities in Nazi Germany. The Board of Deputies of British Jews called his remarks ""completely unacceptable"". Mr Fysh argued that the passes, which can be acquired by being fully vaccinated or receiving a negative lateral flow result, would be ""segregating society based on an unacceptable thing"". He said: ""We are not a 'papers please' society. This is not Nazi Germany. It's the thin end of an authoritarian wedge and that's why we will resist it."" Despite his opposition to being a ""papers please"" society, Mr Fysh voted in September for the Government's Elections Bill which will introduce photographic identification for voting. Despite the threat of further restrictions, local lockdowns won't return this winter as Downing Street rules out lightning Covid curbs for London and hard-hit cities. Cases of the super-strain in the UK have risen by 1,576 in the last 24 hours - taking the total to 4,713. Infections have gone up by 50 per cent in a day - with 20 per cent of all Covid cases now being logged as the mutant variant. And data shows Omicron now makes up 40 per cent of cases in London. But Downing Street sources said there are ""definitely no plans for tiering of any sort"". It comes as the first UK death from the Omicron variant was confirmed by Boris Johnson this morning. The UKHSA revealed ten patients were in English hospitals with the mutated strain - between 18-85 years old, most having had two jabs. Brits have been urged to get their boosters to fight the wave of variant cases. Speaking during a visit to a vaccination clinic near Paddington, in west London, the Prime Minister said: ""Sadly yes Omicron is producing hospitalisations and sadly at least one patient has been confirmed to have died with Omicron. ""So I think the idea that this is somehow a milder version of the virus, I think that's something we need to set on one side and just recognise the sheer pace at which it accelerates through the population. ""So the best thing we can do is all get our boosters."" In new data from Sage, the group that advises the Government, it is estimated two Covid jabs should slash the risk of dying from Omicron by up to 84 per cent. But the models also showed the chance of simply catching the virus and falling ill is twice reduced if you have a booster too. The latest data revealed boosters offer up to 75 per cent protection from mild infection from Omicron."
14,14,The Sun,Harry Cole,Pubs and restaurants could be CLOSED or have entry limits to halt Omicron under plans drawn up by Whitehall officials,"MISERABLE Whitehall officials have drawn up plans to restrict numbers in pubs and restaurants and even close them down in the coming weeks. There are growing fears of further restrictions after Christmas as Omicron is expected to peak in January, with New Year parties in grave doubt. A government source said: ""You will be able to see your family at Christmas, but at this rate, you might not be able to do it in a pub. ""As for New Year's Eve, that is a different story."" But MPs privately warn they will torpedo any attempts to bring in former restrictions like the Rule of Six or a ban on household mixing. Health Secretary Sajid Javid insisted there were ""no plans"" for any more measures, as the Omicron variant was poised to become the dominant strain of Covid in London and it claimed its first victim. More than one in five Tory MPs will vote against Boris Johnson tomorrow night as a brutal rebellion on vaccine passports hit 80. One ex-minister told The Sun that Tuesday night's vote is a ""show of force"". No10 vowed to crack on with the vote despite the PM's majority being wiped out - amid dire warnings of a bigger backlash at any attempt at ""Plan C"" restrictions. But Covid certification for nightclubs, mega-bars and stadiums is expected to sail through the Commons with the backing of Sir Keir Starmer's Labour. Yet Mr Johnson sparked further Tory jitters by refusing to say three times that there will not be further measures introduced before Christmas. Deputy PM Dominic Raab today insisted Brits will be able to ""enjoy"" the festive period with their families but also wouldn't rule out new restrictions. Asked about the possibility of new curbs on pubs and restaurants such as capacity limits, he admitted: ""These issues are always discussed. But he added: ""We have got Plan B, that's what we think is required over the Christmas period. ""I think people can look forward to spending Christmas with loved ones in a way that we couldn't last year."" Mr Raab also defended vaccine passports saying fears about them have been ""overstated"" and they're not the start of a ""slippery slope"" of restrictions. He said that he would be ""very surprised"" if 80 Tory MPs rebel against No 10 over their introduction in tonight's crunch vote. The number expected to rebel in the Commons far outweighs the 56 MPs required to trigger an internal confidence vote in the PM - but falls short of the 181 needed to defeat him.

Despite his opposition to being a ""papers please"" society, Mr Fysh voted in September for the Government's Elections Bill which will introduce photographic identification for voting."
15,15,The Sun,Harry Cole,Five new Tory MPs have demanded scandal-hit Boris Johnson QUITS over Partygate,"BORIS Johnson is facing a growing Tory mutiny as the party's newbies unite with old guard MPs to warn the PM to ""get a grip"". Five MPs from the 2019 intake are now thought to have written letters to demand Mr Johnson quits. It comes after a torrid week for the PM, engulfed in Christmas Party fury and the ongoing wallpaper-gate saga. Yesterday, Mr Johnson was in frantic talks with his anti-sleaze adviser, who demanded evidence to explain discrepancies in the PM's story about the No 10 flat redecoration. Lord Geidt, the PM's independent adviser on standards, probed the spruce-up earlier this year. But new evidence has emerged that Mr Johnson may have known the true source of decorating donations earlier than he claimed. Lord Geidt is said to be ""furious and humiliated"". And last night he was understood to be considering relaunching the probe. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson's senior spin doctor, Jack Doyle, offered to resign over the ongoing row after last year's lockdown-breaking wine and cheese event for No 10 staff. Adviser Allegra Stratton has already quit over the do after a mocking video was leaked. It comes as the PM's personal rating fell by 11 points in less than a month — with YouGov finding his approval score at a new low of -41. MPs have been spotted going to see backbench boss Sir Graham Brady to demand a leadership election. Last week The Sun reported as many as a dozen Tory MPs want a change of leader, still far short of the 56 required to formally trigger a contest. But one angry minister hit back at the Tory newbies, saying: ""It doesn't take long before these kids forget who got them their seat."" Ex-Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell has urged the PM to get a grip to keep his job. He told Times Radio: ""I hope he will still be Prime Minister in a year — but if Downing Street don't get a grip and start to deliver the governance many of my colleagues are talking about openly, then the PM will be in considerable trouble."""
16,16,The Sun,Harry Cole,Whitehall’s anti-sleaze boss demands new evidence to explain what Boris Johnson knew about No10 flat decorations,"WHITEHALL's top anti-sleaze boss has demanded new evidence to explain ""discrepancies"" in Boris Johnson about the Downing Street flat redecoration. Lord Geidt, the PM's independent adviser on standards, probed the flat-gate scandal earlier this year - but now Mr Johnson has been accused of lying about when he knew the true source of decorating donations. The former Buckingham Palace aide is said to be furious and humiliated and has demanded No10 comes up with answers quickly as he considers REOPENING his probe into the saga. Yesterday the Tories were fined thousands of pounds for breaking donation rules over the No11 flat renovations. In an unexpected bodyblow in a week of chaos for the PM, the Electoral Commission rapped them for failing to report how cash was spent on Boris and Carrie's gold £112,549 wallpaper flat renovations. The watchdog said the Tories had failed to ""accurately report a donation and keep a proper accounting record"" of the money handed over by Tory peer Lord Brownlow in October 2020. The PM borrowed more than £52,000 for the refurb, paid for via a party loan from Lord Brownlow. Earlier this year the PM said he had no idea who was behind the cash for it, but yesterday's watchdog report revealed he Whatsapped the peer asking for more cash to help redo the flat where he lives with his wife Carrie and two kids. No10 said he was asking for extra cash for the Downing Street trust, but that he had no idea where the money was coming from. They insisted Mr Johnson had been honest and followed the rules ""at all times"", denying he had lied to his standards chief over what he knew. In May, his independent adviser on standards, Lord Geidt, cleared him of a conflict of interest. Labour's Angela Rayner accused the PM of outright lying in his testimony to the standards chief. She raged: ""The Prime Minister must now explain why he lied to the British public saying he didn't know who was behind No 11 flat refurb - all the while he was WhatsApping the donor asking for more money. ""Boris Johnson has taken the British public for fools. He's not only broken the law but made a mockery of the standards we expect from our prime ministers."" Mr Johnson hit back last night, saying voters can kick him out at the next election if they don't like him. He told an event: ""They have every right to cast us down and out again."""
17,17,The Sun,Harry ColeKate FergusonJonathan Reilly,How to get around new Covid rules – Working From Pub – as Boris slaps Brits with Plan B restrictions,"BARMY new Covid rules mean people can work from the pub with pals from Monday instead of going to the office. The farce emerged as Boris Johnson faced more flak over lockdown-busting Christmas parties and dodgy donations for Downing Street decorating. Pub boss Adam Brooks said: ""With the crazy work from home rules, why don't workers unite in making our nations' pubs their offices?"" Pubs are seizing on the loophole by setting up workspaces with free tea and wifi to entice staff away from kitchen tables. And last night the PM was facing his biggest backlash yet over his plans for vaccine passports at nightclubs and sports events. Landlady Vicky MacDonald is offering a ""workstation"" deal at the Cellar House in Norwich. Barred office workers can get three hours for just £12 — which includes power, a lunchtime sandwich and unlimited teas. She told The Sun: ""Some people are sick of working from home so we thought we'd do what we can to help. In the last week we've had people cancel Christmas parties which has been devastating. ""But if Boris says you're more than welcome to spend your day working at the bar, we're all for it."" Adam Brooks, at The Three Colts in Buckhurst Hill, Essex, added: ""The latest fear-mongering and restrictions have annihilated hospitality at our busiest time. ""With the crazy work from home rules, why don't workers unite in making our pubs their offices?"" The Campaign for Pubs's Greg Mulholland added: ""Whether people are hot-desking in their local or having a party in the pub, they'll get a lot more sense from hardworking publicans and staff than they are from ministers."" And Lee Worsley, boss of the Coach House Inn, Winterbourne Abbas and Kings Arms, Portesham, both in Dorset is offering breakfast or lunch, a hot drink and five hours' work station for £15. He said: ""It's worth taking advantage of these barmy rules to spend some time with a pub's welcoming and lovely staff. ""Working on your own for hours can be negative for your mental health. Working from the pub can help you — and a local business."" Politicians will vote on triggering Covid Plan B next Tuesday. If it passes then the rules will be reviewed by January 5, and automatically expire on January 26. Around 80 backbenchers — many in Red Wall seats — are preparing to vote against. That would be enough to overturn the PM's majority and leave him facing the biggest threat to his authority yet. But Labour's Sir Keir Starmer is set to save Boris's skin and order his MPs to vote through the plan. Tory MP Marcus Fysh said vaccine passports were an ""utter disgrace"" and colleague Simon Jupp branded them ""divisive and discriminatory"". Red Wall poster girl and Bishop Auckland MP Dehenna Davison warned: ""The evidence we have been presented with does not justify further restrictions on liberties. 'Just in case' simply doesn't cut it."" The knives came out for Boris yesterday with MPs privately warning his days could be numbered. One minister told The Sun: ""He is like a cat with nine lives but he has used some up. He's on probation. People are watching closely."" Another Tory fumed: ""It's a total sh**show. Boris has surrounded himself with sycophants like a 17th century court. It needs changing."" A senior Tory chimed in: ""I don't believe a single word Boris says anymore. He's blown it."" Others called for the PM to ""put grown ups in the room"" to end his party's blunders. Labour have signalled they will back passports. But Sir Keir is under pressure to unite with Tory rebels to defeat the Government and call a confidence vote to try to topple BoJo. Labour MP Graham Stringer said the party had ""a duty"" to oppose the plans. A Tory MP admitted Sir Keir could ""kill Boris"" if he plucked up the guts, adding: ""But he won't."" Another 249 Omicron cases were confirmed yesterday, taking the total to 819. In all there were 50,867 more virus cases and 148 deaths. Cases of all variants hit a record high in primary aged pupils last week with one in every 100 catching a strain. Sage's Prof John Edmunds said of Omicron: ""We may have really significant numbers by Christmas."" He said it was too soon to tell if it is milder than Delta. Professor Peter Openshaw added ""Deaths may take several weeks to declare themselves."""
18,18,The Sun,Harry Cole,Here’s everything Boris Johnson is telling YOU to do after having one very different rule for THEM,"BORIS Johnson imposed dramatic Plan B virus rules yesterday — as the Tories faced a backlash over last year's No10 Christmas party. The Grinch PM was accused of ""one rule for them, one for us"". Senior Tory Mark Harper fumed: ""Why should people listen to his instructions to follow the rules when people inside Number 10 Downing Street don't do so?"" The PM told Brits to work from home again if they can and wear masks at most indoor public venues, while ordering vaccine passports and contact testing for Omicron. He apologised for the 2020 lockdown-breaking party, and top aide Allegra Stratton quit in tears after footage showed her joking with staff over the bash. Speaking at Downing Street, the PM said he had no choice but to impose new curbs. Statistics now show 568 Brits infected with Omicron, but scientists say 10,000 have the bug. Gloomy ministers believe infection rates will soar to one million by the end of the month. Tories slammed the ""tyrannical"" measures and said fed-up Brits cannot be expected to stick to rules when Downing Street staff do not. MP Greg Smith said: ""We are being encouraged to go to (our own) Christmas parties while being told to avoid the office at all costs. These rules are absurdly baffling to even the most authoritarian lockdown supporter."" Privately Tory MPs accused the PM of rushing the Plan B decision to distract from the row over the No10 party. One said: ""It is ridiculous. It is no way to run a country."" MPs claimed Mr Johnson had undermined the rollout of his Plan B restrictions by wrecking public confidence in Covid rules. But he insisted he knew nothing of last year's bash at No 10 and launched an internal inquiry into whether aides and civil servants had broken the law with their cheese and wine bash. Despite complaints from Labour MPs, the Met Police last night said they would not investigate the alleged breach of rules due to an ""absence of evidence"". Earlier Mr Johnson told MPs he was furious about leaked footage showing aides laughing and discussing the 2020 soiree on December 18 when London was under Tier 3 measures. Ms Stratton, 41, was filmed taking part in a mock press conference in preparation for televised briefings when she joked about the event. But yesterday in a tearful statement, she offered her ""profound apologies"" and said she will ""regret those remarks for the rest of my days"". Mr Johnson has been dogged for a week by questions over staff breaking lockdown rules, but he has repeatedly insisted he had been assured no rules were broken. Yet after the bombshell video leak, he finally admitted he had based his position on assurances from ""respected civil servants and special advisers"". Mr Johnson then asked Cabinet Secretary Simon Case ""to establish all the facts and to report back as soon as possible"". The PM added: ""It goes without saying that if those rules were broken, then there will be disciplinary action for all those involved. ""I understand and share the anger up and down the country at seeing No 10 staff seeming to make light of lockdown measures because I was also furious to see that clip. ""I apologise unreservedly for the offence that it has caused."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the PM's apology ""raises more questions than answers"" as he had been ""caught red-handed"". Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross said Mr Johnson should quit if he is found to have misled Parliament."
19,19,The Sun,Harry Cole,Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says culture wars and woke attacks on Britain are a gift to our enemies,"CULTURE wars and woke attacks on Britain are a gift to our enemies, Liz Truss will declare. Endless bickering over how bad the UK is makes us a laughing stock to adversaries and gives hostile states like China and Russia an advantage, the Foreign Secretary will add. She will tell the most senior diplomats that the UK has been too naval gazing since the Berlin Wall fell and it is time to ""step forward, be proud of who we are and what we stand for, ready to shape the world anew"". It comes as tensions with Russia mount over Ukraine. Ms Truss will tell the Chatham House think tank today: ""In recent years the free world took its eyes off the ball. ""After the collapse of communism, many were convinced it was the end of history, confident that freedom and democracy would go global. ""People turned inwards. It's time to wake up. The age of introspection must end now. ""We need to believe in Britain and project the best of Britain to the world. ""I want us to be confident, outward-looking, patriotic and positive and to be proud of our great country."" She plans to closer partnerships with allies like Japan, Australia, Canada, Indonesia and India across trade, tech and security. An ally said: ""Liz thinks we need to spend less time quarrelling among ourselves and more on promoting freedom and winning the battle for global influence against bad guys."""
20,20,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson and Joe Biden set for emergency talks over fears Russia will invade Ukraine,"BORIS Johnson and Joe Biden were set for emergency talks last night as fears Russia will invade Ukraine soared. The call between the US and UK, and Nato allies France, Italy and Germany came as the US President warned Vladimir Putin that retaliation with sanctions would be swift if he crossed the border by force. The Russians have massed 70,000 troops on the frontier with Ukraine, with the US claiming they are poised to attempt to annex the former Soviet satellite state. Mr Johnson's spokesman warned Russia to de-escalate tensions. And the White House said they could even deploy troops to the region in support of Nato. An official promised ""additional forces and capabilities and exercises to ensure the safety and security of our eastern flank allies in the face of aggression in Ukraine."" They added: ""We have had intensive discussions with our European partners about what we would do in the event of a major Russian military escalation in Ukraine. ""We have a path involving substantial economic countermeasures, by both the Europeans and the United States, that would impose severe harm on the Russian economy."" Last week Liz Truss held ""robust"" talks with her Moscow counterpart. Her spokesman said: ""The Foreign Secretary expressed concern about rising tensions across Europe, and restated the UK's support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, urging the Russian government to de-escalate the situation."""
21,21,The Sun,Harry ColeKate Ferguson,"Evil child murderers like Arthur Labinjo-Hughes’ father and step-mum will die in prison under new laws, PM vows","BORIS Johnson yesterday vowed to bring in a new ""Arthur's Law"" so evil child killers will die behind bars. The Prime Minister told The Sun: ""Anyone who plans then carries out the murder of a child should never be released from prison. ""So we're toughening the law to make whole-life orders the starting point for such abhorrent crimes."" Mr Johnson also last night cracked the whip on bringing forward a rapid review on toughening up the sentences handed down to tragic Arthur Labinjo-Hughes's killer father and stepmother. Emma Tustin, 32, was jailed for life, with a minimum of 29 years, and dad Thomas Hughes could be out after just two-thirds of his 21-year sentence for manslaughter. Together they inflicted horrendous pain on little Arthur, six, by beating the defenceless lad and poisoning him with salt. It came as pictures emerged of the vile pair smiling and lounging in a hot-tub, while the terrified youngster was forced to stand for hours in a hallway. The grinning killers cooled down in last year's spring heatwave as Arthur was left roasting in a fluffy onesie. Discussing the horrific case, the PM said: ""The Attorney General is also urgently considering the facts of this case and the sentence handed down, but this is a Government that will always legislate for the toughest possible sentences for such repugnant crimes."" Mr Johnson's spokesman added: ""We want this to be looked at as a matter of urgency."" The PM's intervention comes after Arthur's grieving grandfather demanded the killers ""must never see the light of day again"" and The Sun launched our ""Justice For Arthur"" campaign. Peter Halcrow, 61, said he was ""shocked and mystified"" as to how social workers had failed to raise the alarm as the boy was starved, poisoned and beaten to death. And he added: ""No punishment could ever be enough for this pair."" The Government will now amend the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill that is currently working its way through Parliament, to bring pre-meditated child murder into line with the most serious offences against children. At the moment, life sentences apply for abducting and then murdering a child, or murdering them with a sexual or sadistic intent. Plotting to kill a child and then committing the act will now be added to that list. Mr Johnson added: ""This will be no solace to the friends and family of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes who have my deepest sympathies and condolences."" And Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi told MPs yesterday: ""No government can legislate for evil, but we will take action wherever we can to stop it happening again. We must do more."" The NSPCC said little Arthur's death must be a ""watershed moment"". In heart-wrenching scenes in Parliament yesterday, MPs across the political divide united to pay tribute to Arthur and demanded to know why ""things went so horrifyingly wrong"". They blasted the ""too soft"" sentences handed to his evil dad and stepmum, and demanded judges lock them up and ""throw away the key"". Tory Julian Knight — Arthur's local MP in Solihull, West Mids — begged ministers to leave ""no stone unturned"" in finding out what went so tragically wrong. Shocked politicians said they were moved to tears by the ""bone-chilling case"" and hugged their own kids ""a little tighter"" as they heard the sickening details. His voice shaking with emotion, he recounted some of Arthur's last words as he said: ""No one loves me, no one is going to feed me. ""Those are the words that broke the hearts of my town and it seems our country as well. ""A young lad who never had a chance. He experienced unimaginable brutality in his short life."" He said the review must get to the bottom of why police, teachers and social services failed to speak to each other about the case. Fellow Tory Saqib Bhatti said Brits have been left ""devastated"" at the killing and demanded tougher sentences for Tustin and Hughes. He said: ""I have to admit, many times over the last few days I've thought they should lock them up and throw away the key."" Conservative colleague Simon Hoare described the case as ""bone chilling"" and called for a ""crusade"" on a par with the campaign against female violence Responding to the MPs, Mr Zahawi added: ""As we uncover what went wrong and led to Arthur's tragic death, we must also strengthen our resolve to make sure that those who would do wicked acts to children face justice. ""We must do absolutely everything in our power to protect vulnerable young children from harrowing and evil abuse."" Lib Dem Munira Wilson demanded more money for kids' social services as ""you cannot put a price on a child's life"" and Labour shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson warned ""vulnerable children are being failed"". Anna Edmundson, of the NSPCC, said: ""The name Arthur Labinjo-Hughes will be etched into our memories alongside Baby P, Victoria Climbie, Daniel Pelka and many more who suffered sickening cruelty. ""This national outpouring of grief must be a watershed moment."""
22,22,The Sun,Harry Cole,Ex-bra tycoon Michelle Mone in racist slur row after claims she abused Indian man,"TORY peer and ex-bra tycoon Michelle Mone was at the centre of a racism row last night over claims she abused an Indian man and called his wife a ""loony"". She is said to have hit out in WhatsApp messages after a Monaco yacht crash in June 2019. An anonymous man of Indian heritage told The Guardian he made a formal complaint alleging she called him ""a waste of a man's white skin"". But the House of Lords watchdog said it could not investigate because the incident fell outside of parliamentary duties. Last night her lawyers said it was ""inconceivable"" she would make such a comment. A spokesman insisted: ""Baroness Mone is 100 per cent not a racist. ""She and her husband have built over 15 schools in Africa in the past three years."""
23,23,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris warned he risks break up of Union if he does not fix Northern Ireland border row soon,"BORIS Johnson has been warned Sinn Fein will sweep to power in Northern Ireland and break up the UK if he does not fix the row over Brexit border checks. DUP heavyweight Ian Paisley Jr says further delay will only ""embolden republicans in Northern Ireland and those who want to rip us out of the United Kingdom."" Britain is at loggerheads with Brussels over the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol that forces checks on goods travelling from the mainland to Ulster. Mr Johnson has threatened to trigger the emergency Article 16 break clause to suspend the rules claiming they are crippling trade - but is locked in talks with the EU to try avoid having to do so. But Mr Paisley, MP for North Antrim, has warned time is running out to come good on that threat - or risk nationalists romping to victory in next year's elections in the province. The unionist big wig told The Sun that Mr Johnson risks going down in history as as a terrible PM's if he goes soft on his tough talk. Amid growing Cabinet concerns that the PM has ""gone wobbly"", Mr Paisley says Sinn Fein are on the march and risk seizing control of Stormont if the standoff continues much longer - opening the door to years of wrangling over Irish unification. He hit out: ""This is a do or die moment for the Prime Minister. The past 12 months have cost Northern Ireland dearly. ""Triggering Article 16 is long overdue. It is a legitimate and proportionate response to the failed Protocol that has disrupted internal UK trade, inflated internal UK costs, created political unrest and tensions here are festering. ""So long as Boris Johnson sticks by this failing status quo, he will only embolden republicans in Northern Ireland and those who want to rip us out of the United Kingdom. ""Let's be clear PM if this situation continues unchanged Sinn Fein are in poll position to capitalise electorally. ""And they will be given a platform to demand Ulster's removal from the Union. Is that the outcome you can stomach, Boris? ""I say to the Prime Minister, the alarm is sounding. The Union is being undermined. It's time to act. ""Take back control of the entire United Kingdom or history will not be kind to your stewardship of the Union."" Yesterday Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he is an ""optimist"" when it comes to the prospect of a deal with the EU on the Protocol, but triggering Article 16 is still on the table as ""substantive gaps"" remain between the two sides. He struck a hopeful tone after Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said on Wednesday that reaching an agreement on the protocol before Christmas was ""unrealistic"". Brexit minister Lord Frost previously said both the UK and the EU wanted the dispute ""settled one way or the other"" before the winter. A government spokesman said: ""The bottom line is that the EU's proposals don't go far enough to address the real problems facing people in Northern Ireland because of the Protocol. ""We're clear we'd rather agree solutions, but if we can't we'll have to use the safeguard provisions in the Protocol to preserve stability in Northern Ireland instead. ""The EU urgently needs to show more realism and flexibility if we are going to find an agreed way through."""
24,24,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha Clark,Boris Johnson rejects calls for Christmas Covid curbs and urges Brits to carry on with festive fun,"CHRISTMAS parties should not be cancelled because of Covid — and children can still have their school nativity plays, Boris Johnson said last night. In a stinging rebuke to one of the country's top doctors, the PM batted away calls for families to scrap get-togethers in the coming weeks amid fears over the Omicron variant. His plea came as worried hospitality chiefs warned that vital Christmas trade is already being blighted by cancellations because of panic over the new mutant strain. As 22 cases of the variant were confirmed in the UK, the PM vowed there was no need for further restrictions beyond tougher masks rules and border testing. Instead, the PM said he would ""throw everything"" to get every adult a third jab by the end of January, deploying the Army to help the NHS in temporary vaccine hubs ""popping up like Christmas trees"". Health minister Gillian Keegan echoed Mariah Carey and said: ""All we want honestly for Christmas is for everyone to get jabbed."" She said the chances of having to put in further restrictions over the festive period were ""pretty low"" and vowed that ""Christmas is on track"". And in a fillip for booster jabs, Oxford University said: ""Despite the appearance of new variants over the past year, vaccines have continued to provide very high levels of protection against severe disease and there is no evidence so far that Omicron is any different."" The Government's stance had been countered yesterday by the head of the UK's Health Security Agency, who urged against people getting together and said working from home was a ""good idea"". Dr Jenny Harries added: ""If we all decrease our social contacts a little bit, actually that helps to keep the variant at bay. Being careful, not socialising when we don't particularly need to, would help."" But Mr Johnson said: ""We don't want people to cancel such events."" Asked if he agreed with Dr Harries assessment, he added: ""So the answer is no. The guidance remains the same, and we're trying to take a balanced and proportionate approach to the particular risk that seems to be posed by Omicron."" Yesterday, tough new fines came in for people not wearing a mask on trains, buses or in shops and anyone landing in the UK now has to isolate until a negative day two test result. No 10 says these measures will only be kept in place until the dangers of Omicron are understood in full and it does not want to tighten them further. Mr Johnson said: ""We are not going to be changing the overall guidance, we don't think that's necessary."" His spokesman said that Dr Harries ""gives advice to the Government, she is not the Government. The public should follow the guidance set out by the Government"". Vaccine minister Maggie Throup also piled in, saying: ""We have set out proportionate and balanced measures which do not include limiting socialising. It is the Government that sets policy and guidance, which is what the public should follow."" We don't want people to cancel such events. The row between ministers and the civil servant came as MPs backed temporary mask and border restrictions by 434 to just 23. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer last night urged the Government to go further in restrictions with even tougher border rules. However, fuming Tory MPs slammed the mask and testing rules. Backbencher Sir Christopher Chope said: ""These regulations are part of a scaremongering propaganda campaign on the part of the Government, which is really designed to try to stop or restrict social interaction between social animals who happen to be living in the United Kingdom. ""They're designed to suppress freedom of the individual and suppress social contact, and they're doing that through unreasonable fear-mongering."" Tory backbench boss Sir Graham Brady said there were serious concerns about the ""efficacy of what is being proposed"" — and warned against ""mission creep"". Craig Mackinlay blasted what he described as the madness of moving through cycles of restrictions, vaccines, freedoms and back again. He said: ""We need to move back to a world where we trust people."" Sir Desmond Swayne warned that there could be another ""pingdemic"" that would hammer enterprises across the country. Former health minister Steve Brine accused ministers of pushing a ""narrative that is causing Christmas parties to be cancelled"". And Steve Baker accused ministers of ""taking the path to hell"" by extending Covid restrictions into next year. Last night, UK Hospitality chief Kate Nicholls also raised the alarm over people being scared away from pubs and restaurants. It is important to remember that hospitality operators have invested significantly to ensure the safety of staff and customers, focusing on better ventilation, hygiene and sanitation. She said: ""It is important to remember that hospitality operators have invested significantly to ensure the safety of staff and customers, focusing on better ventilation, hygiene and sanitation — measures which Sage recommend are the most effective of infection control. ""This means hospitality venues will be far safer places to socialise with family and friends this Christmas than at home."" Figures released yesterday showed that there were 39,716 new infections in the previous 24 hours, while 159 people had died within 28 days of a positive test."
25,25,The Sun,Harry Cole,Liz Truss channels Margaret Thatcher in a British tank as she warns Vladmir Putin against invasion plans,"LIZ Truss did a Margaret Thatcher yesterday — and climbed aboard a British tank to warn Russia against invasion plans. The Foreign Secretary said President Vladimir Putin would be making a strategic mistake if he took military action to extend his territory. Wearing a helmet and armoured vest, Ms Truss was just miles from the Russian border as she declared: ""We will stand with our fellow democracies against Russia's malign activity."" And she vowed Nato would safeguard the security of Ukraine amid growing fears Putin will annexe the neighbour state. Mrs Thatcher revived her Iron Lady status in 1986 by riding on a Challenger tank at a Nato training camp in Germany — wearing goggles and a headscarf. The ambitious Ms Truss was visiting hundreds of battle-ready British troops near Tallinn, Estonia, right. Back home, she has parked her tanks firmly on No10's lawn by topping a Tory party members poll. It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson's unpopularity plunged to new lows — coming bottom for recent performance in the eyes of the true blue faithful. The PM is now ranked minus 17, according to the latest grassroots survey for ConservativeHome, while Ms Truss has a plus 82.3 rating. Her tank stunt came ahead of Nato foreign ministers gathering in Latvia to consider how to respond to Russia's military build-up near the Ukrainian border — and tensions between Belarus and Poland. She used the Riga summit to call for the western alliance to stand united in the face of growing aggression from Moscow. Ms Truss said: ""We want a world where freedom and democracy don't just survive, they thrive."" And she rejected Kremlin claims that Nato's actions were provocative."
26,26,The Sun,Ellie CambridgeHarry ColeNick Gutteridge,Boris Johnson says all adults will be offered boosters by end of January in bid to save Christmas from Omicron,"BORIS Johnson today unveiled his battleplan to offer booster jabs to every British adult by the end of January. Hundreds more NHS vaccination sites are opening nationally, and the army is set to be drafted in to turbo-charge the fight against Omicron. Soldiers will help set up and staff some of the new jab clinics, as they join the effort see off the mutant variant threat. Health bosses are hiring an extra 10,000 vaccinators as well as urging tens of thousands to join frontline volunteers, including The Sun's Jabs Army. The PM said he would be ""throwing everything"" at the troublesome variant, which has left scientists all around the world concerned. It comes as he took a step back in the roadmap out of the pandemic, bringing back some restrictions to stop the spread of super strain Omicron. Speaking to the nation he outlined aims to put rocket boosters under the jabs programme, and increase the number of doses administered every week from 2.5 million to 3.5 million. Amid his rallying cry to get every adult signed up for their booster shot, Boris said: ""The best way to show our grit is to do our bit and step forward when time comes for the booster. ""I've been waiting patiently for my moment to come. It's happening on Thursday I'm pleased to say. ""So whenever your turn comes, get your booster and ask your friends and your family to do the same. ""It's time for another great British vaccination effort. We've done it before and we're going to do it again. And let's not give this virus a second chance."" He revealed the NHS has already rolled out an impressive 18million boosters across the country, but added ""we've got millions more to do to protect the most vulnerable"". The PM also explained that while everyone over-18 who had their second jab three months ago can get their boosters under the new rules, the vulnerable and elderly will be called up first. Brits must therefore wait to be told they can book in for their extra shot by the NHS, with plans for this to be done for everyone by the end of January. Sajid Javid echoed the PM's calls to get everyone jabbed, to ""give ourselves the best chance of a Christmas with our loved ones"". It comes as... He said boosting the nation's immunity is the best line of defence against the threat of the variant, and the most important way we can return to normality quicker. The Health Secretary said: ""What we're seeing recently has brought back memories of the strain of the last winter. ""But although we can't say with certainty what lies ahead, we have one huge advantage that we didn't have back then: our vaccination programme, which has already done so much to keep this virus at bay."" NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard said she was aiming to free up capacity to allow hospitals, GPs and other services to administer more booster jabs. She praised medics in northern England, hit by Storm Arwen this week, who were jabbing ""by candlelight"", after losing electricity. The health chief said GPs and pharmacies would be offered £15 per shot until the end of January, with an additional £5 for Sunday shots and a £30 premium for those delivered to the housebound until the end of next month. Mr Johnson said England will have more than 1500 community pharmacy sites set up to boost the jab efforts. He levelled with Brits, saying: ""I know the frustration that we all feel with this Omicron variant, the sense of exhaustion that we could be going through all this all over again. ""But today I want to stress this, today that's the wrong thing to feel because today our position is and always will be immeasurably better than it was a year ago. ""What we're doing is taking some proportionate precautionary measures while our scientists crack the Omicron code."" It comes after scientists yesterday green-lighted boosters for all adults in the UK in a bid to ward off the spread of Omicron. They also slashed the gap needed between a second and third dose from six months to just three. Boris said today: ""The measures taking effect today are proportionate and responsible, and will buy us time in the face of this new variant. ""Vaccines and boosters remain our best line of defence, so it is more important than ever that people come forward when eligible to get boosted."" There have been 13 cases of Omicron identified in England and nine in Scotland now, but ministers expect that number to rise. Experts say while the new strain might dent the effectiveness of current vaccines it's very unlikely to evade them completely. Ministers have pledged to remain on the ""front foot"" in the fight against the Covid super-strain. But frustrated Brits aged 18 or over who would now be eligible were confused after being unable to book a vaccine appointment yesterday. The announcement sparked a scramble on the NHS vaccine booking website, with thousands of people waiting in online queues to secure a slot. The PM has also announced new restrictions to help curb the spread of the mutant variant which came into force at 4am this morning. They include compulsory mask wearing on public transport and in shops, post offices, and banks - but not pubs and restaurants. Brits who come into contact with someone who tests positive for Omicron will now have to isolate for 10 days even if they're vaccinated. And international arrivals now need to take a PCR test on Day 2 and must quarantine until they get a negative result. Today ministers tried to reassure Brits that ""Christmas is on track"" but warned a lot will depend on how dangerous the variant turns out to be. Scientists think the new strain is much more transmissible but little is know about its potential ability to evade vaccines. In South Africa, where it was identified, doctors have reported mild symptoms in positive cases but they are predominantly younger people. Care minister Gillian Keegan said: ""The boosters will help, and we're just trying to deal with this unknown at the moment. ""We very much hope that we we have a Christmas this year, we've had an awful experience last year."" She said the chances of being forced to isolate over the festive period were ""pretty low"" but the new variant ""is unfortunate timing from that perspective""."
27,27,The Sun,Harry Cole,Labour deputy Angela Rayner clueless about Sir Keir Starmer’s reshuffle as Yvette Cooper returns to frontbench,"LABOUR leader Sir Keir Starmer did a surprise Shadow Cabinet reshuffle last night — catching his own deputy on the hop. In the second rejig this year, ex-Labour minister Yvette Cooper returned to the front bench. As Shadow Home Secretary, she is tasked with tackling Priti Patel over migrants and crime. And former Labour leader Ed Miliband was stripped of his business brief after angering Sir Keir on demands to nationalise energy. Leadership contender Lisa Nandy will go head to head with Michael Gove on levelling up in a demotion from the Shadow Foreign Secretary job. Rising stars Wes Streeting and Bridget Phillipson were handed the key roles at Health and Education. Emily Thornberry was demoted to Shadow Attorney General. And the reshuffle was a humiliating blow to Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner, who has made several digs at Sir Keir over recent weeks. Yesterday morning she was on the radio denying Sir Keir would conduct a reshuffle — just two hours before the Labour leader began one. She told Times Radio: ""No, I'm not aware of any plans for a reshuffle. I reckon that Keir would tell me first, yeah."" Last night Sir Keir said: ""We are a smaller, more focused Shadow Cabinet."""
28,28,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha Clark,Head teachers warned against shutting schools early as experts say jabs will resist new mutant Covid Omicron,"HEAD teachers have been warned against shutting schools early or scrapping nativity plays — as experts say the jabs will resist new mutant Covid. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi urged teachers to hold their nerve yesterday, amid growing concern over the Omicron strain. Mr Zahawi insisted closing schools would ""be the last possible option"" this winter, as he rejected pleas for a return to bubbles or home-schooling, saying: ""The best place for children is in the classroom, learning."" It came as former Vaccine Task Force boss Dr Clive Dix shrugged off concerns, insisting Britain was ""in good shape"" to fight the variant. Rogue heads are already closing classes ahead of the Christmas holidays and saying pupils with runny noses will be sent home. Teaching unions are also demanding more cash if they are to keep schools open. They were slapped down yesterday by PM Boris Johnson, who said closing classrooms was ""not something we are looking to do"". There are no reports of any Omicron patients being admitted to hospital anywhere in the world. More than 160 cases have now been confirmed globally, with most in South Africa. And Dr Angelique Coetzee, head of the South African Medical Association, said her patients' symptoms have been very mild. She said: ""What we are seeing clinically in South Africa — and remember I'm practising in the epicentre — is extremely mild cases. We haven't admitted anyone."" Downing Street was also buoyed by Dr Dix's comments after he said it was ""close to impossible"" the jabs would not fight Omicron. He said: ""I think our vaccines will hold up and we will be fine."" He said he was not that concerned about Omicron as it was highly likely the jabs would continue to work. And he insisted: ""This is very unlikely to be anything other than another variant, just like Kent, just like Delta."" His reassuring words came as: Health Secretary Sajid Javid yesterday insisted the rules that come into force today will not remain in place for a day longer than necessary. Meanwhile, the fate of thousands of nativities and Christmas plays are up in the air as town halls told schools to cancel. But Health Minister Ed Argar insisted: ""We haven't told schools to cancel events like that."" And Mr Zahawi added: ""My very strong advice is, if you organising a nativity, carry on."" His comments came as a poll suggested more than one in four primary school teachers will let parents watch nativities online only. A Teacher Tapp poll of 1,711 primaries in England found one in ten has scrapped this year's show. School unions have called for yet more cash to deal with the burden of the new variant, which is set to force hundreds of staff and students to isolate. Geoff Barton, of the Association of School and College Leaders, says schools need money for ventilation machines and ""simply cannot sustain the costs of the supply cover that is required"". But Arabella Skinner, director of parent campaign group UsForThem, said it would be shameful to cancel children's social events during the festive season. She said: ""Parents are devastated to see so many schools ramp up restrictions for a second year in a row."""
29,29,The Sun,Harry Cole,Labour botches another reshuffle as Sir Keir Starmer blindsides Angela Rayner AGAIN,"ANGELA Rayner was left humiliated today after denying Sir Keir Starmer would conduct a reshuffle just two hours before the Labour leader started moving frontbenchers. The deputy leader told a radio interview that the party was more focussed on big issues and holding the government's feet to the fire rather than discussing ""internal jobs"". But at the same time the Labour leader was beginning to shift around his top team for the second time this year - blindsiding his number 2. Sir Keir's first attempt last May went off half cocked with a doomed attempt to demote Ms Rayner ended up with the deputy leader getting a slew of promotions after she refused to be side-lined. And today's effort appears to be equally calamitous. Ahead of a big speech about sleaze, Ms Rayner told Times Radio just after 8 o'clock this morning: ""No, I'm not aware of any plans for a reshuffle. I haven't been consulted, so I don't think there's any, you know, focus on that at the moment… ""We've been holding the government to account and that's what we're focusing on at the moment, not internal what job you've got."" Embarrassingly she added: ""I reckon that Keir would tell me first yeah."" But behind the scenes Sir Keir had spent the morning calling Shadow Cabinet ministers about their future jobs. At 11.30am, Ms Rayner again told reporters ""I've been concentrating on the job that I'm doing"" and again said she was not aware of a reshuffle. But her spokesman later clarified that Sir Keir had called Ms Rayner to inform her of a reshuffle ""in the future"" but not that it was today, or any of the details. However moments later Labour frontbencher Cat Smith announced that she was quitting the Shadow Cabinet - and revealed Sir Keir was already conducting a reshuffle. Ms Smith was a key member of Ms Rayner's team posing questions on how informed the Labour deputy really was on the planned changes. And Sir Keir's spokesman said shortly after: confirmed that the reshuffle of Labour's frontbench was ""underway"". A senior Tory source hit back: ""Starmer's reshuffle is already a shambles. If he can't run his own frontbench properly, how can he pretend he could run the country?"""
30,30,The Sun,Harry Cole,Three Omicron cases in UK & 225 more ‘likely’ but new rules ‘won’t ruin Christmas’,"HEALTH chiefs last night confirmed a third case of the new Omicron Covid strain in the UK — amid fears there are already hundreds of others. More than 75 ""probable"" cases of the mutant variant have been flagged with more than 150 possible others, according to Government sources. Ministers and scientists are scrambling to work out how contagious and dangerous Omicron is. It is feared to spread more rapidly. But one doctor in South Africa, where it was identified 12 days ago, reported its symptoms as ""mild"". Meanwhile, the UK Health Security Agency warned it was ""very likely"" further Omicron cases will be discovered in the coming days. Last night there were extensive contact tracing efforts in Westminster after it emerged the latest confirmed case had visited before leaving the UK. But Health Secretary Sajid Javid dismissed calls for a further lockdown. He said infections and hospitalisations were ""nowhere near"" the level required for restrictions beyond those announced by Boris Johnson at Saturday's surprise press conference. Mr Javid said the tighter restrictions on the border and masks for Christmas shoppers and commuters are needed to ""buy time"" to work out how bad the new variant is and whether it blunts the effectiveness of vaccines. Last night it was confirmed: But Mr Javid insisted these restrictions would not spoil festivities and urged Brits to ""keep making plans to see family and friends"" — just like he is doing. He said: ""I think people should continue with their plans as normal for Christmas. I think it's going to be a great Christmas."" But he warned it would be ""irresponsible"" to guarantee that further restrictions would not be needed. He told Times Radio: ""We've been very open with the information we have. We just don't know enough yet to make definitive conclusions. ""But if we can buy some time to stop it from being seeded quickly or to stop its spread — then we can use that sensibly to assess it more and get answers to all these vital questions."" Teams of AstraZeneca scientists are ""confident"" that they will defeat the latest Covid variant - as they conduct tests in hotspots so that the company's Vaxzervria jab can be tweaked quickly if necessary. The scientists remained upbeat about their ability to adapt their vaccine if needed to battle the new mutation. A spokeswoman told the Daily Express: ""We are looking into the Omicron variant to understand more about it and the impact on the vaccine. ""AstraZeneca has developed, in collaboration with Oxford University, a vaccine platform that enables us to respond quickly to new variants. ""AZ is also already conducting research in locations where the variant has been identified, that will enable us to collect real-world data."" Despite reassurances, vaccine task force boss Sir John Bell warned that it was too late to stop ""the monster"" from reaching the UK — and it would only be a ""matter of time"" before infections rocket. But he confirmed a ""tweak"" to existing coronavirus jabs could be done and Britain was well-placed to do so thanks to the Oxford/AstraZeneca team. Labour last night demanded workers be sent home from offices, and even tighter rules on masks and borders. Frontbencher Lisa Nandy hit out: ""There are a number of outstanding holes in our defences"" around travel. She warned: ""We don't think the Government has been getting the balance right up to now. ""That's why we support the measures to bring in greater use of masks, mandatory masks in some settings. ""And we'll be asking questions about whether the scientific basis for that suggests that that needs to go further."" A handful of head teachers even urged schools to close early for the Christmas holidays and there were calls for a return to hated social distancing. But Mr Javid rejected the moves. He told Sky News: ""We know now those types of measures do carry a very heavy price, both economically, socially, in terms of non-Covid health outcomes such as impact on mental health. ""So if one was to make decisions like that, they would have to be done very, very carefully and we're not there yet — we're nowhere near that."" Yesterday 37,681 Covid cases were confirmed, with 51 deaths. The number of patients going into hospital was 11 per cent down on last week. A DOCTOR who treated Omicron patients says symptoms are mild but unusual — including high heart rate. Dr Angelique Coetzee, who runs a private clinic in Pretoria, South Africa, said it did not cause loss of taste or smell like previous variants. She said cases were not serious but added: ""We have to worry about older, unvaccinated people. ""If they are not vaccinated, we are going to see many with a severe form of the disease."" The Omicron strain may also be able to avoid vaccines, experts fear. A VEGAN who refused a Covid jab in a stand against animal testing has died from the virus. Glynn Steel, 54, lost his fight for life after two weeks in intensive care. His wife Emma, 50, said his last words were: ""I have never felt so ill. I wish I'd had the vaccine."" Double jabbed Emma, of Malvern, Worcs, said near the end Glynn ""begged for the vaccine"" but was told it was too late. She urged other people to get inoculated."
31,31,The Sun,Nick ParkerHarry ColeKate Ferguson,Dozens more migrants arrived in Britain yesterday amid political bickering between PM and Macron,"DOZENS more desperate migrants reached Britain's shores yesterday — hours before Boris Johnson wrote to President Macron with fresh measures to try to finally stem the flow of arrivals from France. As politicians on both sides of the Channel blamed each other after 27 people drowned attempting the perilous trip on Wednesday, at least 50 asylum seekers were brought into Dover huddled on RNLI lifeboats before being moved onto waiting buses. The PM urged Emmanuel Macron to green-light putting British border guard boots on French soil within days to help their teams struggling to guard the coastline. Joint ships could also patrol the entire Channel in a team effort to stop dividing the sea in half. And Mr Johnson demanded a bilateral returns deal with France for them to take back every illegal migrant making the crossing to Britain in a hard-ball tactic to deter people smugglers completely. He also promised more joint intelligence sharing and extra technology to better monitor the Channel for small boats. Home Secretary Priti Patel is set to visit France this weekend to try to push for radical action. Government sources say there is genuine political will for both sides to step up after the tragic Channel deaths and the PM hailed efforts so far to find a solution. But France declared Britain an ""El Dorado"" for illegal immigrants with lax labour laws driving the record rush of Channel crossings. President Macron's enforcer Gérald Darmanin said ""the attractiveness of Great Britain"" was to blame for Wednesday's small boat tragedy off Calais, which left three children and a pregnant woman among the dead. As Britain hit back by again offering to put boots on the ground in northern France, MPs called for a national state of emergency to be declared. Ministers were under growing pressure to declare one and even tear up the Human Rights Act so Britain can finally crack down on the problem. After the PM had earlier accused the Paris government of not doing more to stop the crossings, France's Interior Minister let rip in an astonishing broadside. Mr Darmanin told French TV that traffickers were ""criminals who exploit the misery of others, of women and children and for a few thousand euros they promise them El Dorado in England. And sadly, this has been repeated every day for the last 20 years"". Pointing the finger, he added: ""We are suffering from British policy. We won't be lectured at by the British. We are neither their employees nor their auxiliaries."" Suggesting that UK employers see migrants as a source of cheap labour, he added: ""People say 1.2million illegal immigrants are in Great Britain. English employers use this workforce."" The blast came as the UK and France traded blows for a second day, with Ms Patel again offering our border guards to France in a bid to stop the boats. Mr Macron accused Mr Johnson of trying to politicise the crisis but confirmed he had asked for ""extra help"" from the UK. Ministers were under growing pressure to declare one and even tear up the Human Rights Act so Britain can finally crack down on the problem Hitting back at the PM's suggestion that the French were not doing enough to patrol their beaches, he warned his counterpart not to ""exploit a tragic situation for political ends"". Updating the Commons yesterday afternoon, the Home Secretary claimed she had repeated the offer for Brits to help patrol northern France ""within the last hour"". After Mr Johnson made the same suggestion in an emergency call with Mr Macron, Ms Patel said she had made a very clear offer to her French counterpart of British officers taking part in ""joint patrols to prevent these dangerous journeys from taking place"". Mr Macron apparently took umbrage at Mr Johnson's tone during the call, after which the PM told reporters: ""We've had difficulties persuading some of our partners, particularly the French, to do things in a way that we think the situation deserves."" But Pierre-Henri Dumont, the MP for Calais, dismissed the ""crazy"" proposal, which he said would not change anything along the vast shoreline. Ms Patel told MPs: ""I've asked them today for an honest assessment in terms of their own numbers on the beaches — whether or not there are gaps, if more officers are needed, a realistic assessment in terms of the number of migrants that are coming from Belgium [to the UK via France] in particular. ""But absolutely more police officers, more intelligence co-operation, more on technologies — we have put forward a very, very significant technology offer which does include enhanced surveillance. ""We've also offered to put more officers — unwarranted because they will not take warranted officers — but these are the things I will be working through very specifically now because the status quo cannot persist."" The UK is limited in what it can do to turn boats away and deport illegal immigrants because of commitments made under the European Convention on Human Rights. Deputy PM Dominic Raab is preparing to announce plans to reform the Human Rights Act to make it easier to boot out foreign criminals — but MPs want him to go further. Tory grandee Edward Leigh said: ""We cannot wait on the French co-operating with us and taking these poor people back as they should. We have to act now in a national emergency to save lives."" The UK is limited in what it can do to turn boats away and deport illegal immigrants because of commitments made under the European Convention on Human Rights He added: ""We have to be tough, we have to face down the human rights lawyers. If governments are weak, people will die."" Ms Patel replied that ""every option is on the table"". But the war of words showed no sign of slowing the record rush across the Channel — as the latest arrived in two boats at dawn yesterday. Other migrants in Calais were undeterred by the drownings and pledged to get to Britain by any means, regardless of risk. Iraqi asylum seeker Ali, 23, who has been in France for weeks, said: ""We don't have a life. We want to live like you in the UK. People are trying and they die or have a chance to get past the Channel."" Five alleged people smugglers said to have been involved in the death boat launch were cleared of blame yesterday in another embarrassing blow for French authorities. Mr Darmanin earlier announced at least one suspect had bought small inflatable boats from Germany and all were ""directly linked"" to the drownings. But prosecutors said there was nothing to connect them with the tragedy. Hundreds of mourners attended a candlelit vigil in the central park in Calais last night."
32,32,The Sun,Harry Cole,Rishi raged at Boris over huge spending promises during budget talk,"TENSIONS between Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson's boiled over during Budget talks, The Sun can reveal. The Chancellor demanded the PM's aides leave the room for a ""reality check chat"" as he raged over huge spending promises. Allies deny claims that Mr Sunak threatened to resign. A government source said: ""Things got very bad in the run up to the spending review when No10 just kept saying more, more. It boiled over eventually and they had a long chat just the two of them."" Other Downing Street insiders confirmed the showdown in mid-October. Yesterday the Times reported that Mr Sunak's allies have grown frustrated with the chaotic nature of the No10 operation in another round of stinging briefings. The Prime Minister's official spokesman insisted that the teams in No 10 and No 11 ""continue to work together very well at all levels"". The Sun yesterday revealed ministers want Mr Sunak's key aide Liam Booth-Smith sacked over denied claims he was behind the attacks. One minister said: ""The Chancellor's team is out of control."" No 10 said: ""Of course, the Prime Minister has confidence in the team at No 11. ""They work very closely together delivering on the public's priorities."""
33,33,The Sun,Harry Cole,Cabinet ministers call for head of Rishi Sunak’s chief aide as Tory handbags escalate,"CABINET ministers are calling for the head of Rishi Sunak's chief aide as Tory handbags escalated. Treasury hardman Liam Booth Smith has been blamed for a withering anonymous attack aimed at Boris Johnson given to the BBC - but he denies being the culprit. Last night one top minister told The Sun: ""The Chancellor's team is out of control and Liam needs to be fired. Pour l'encouragement des autres."" Mr Sunak's enforcer has been accused of briefing against the PM previously, but last night the Chancellor was standing by his man. The latest Cabinet sniping came as Mr Johnson defended his record in office as he faced questions about his leadership and political future. In a rowdy session of Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson was cheered by Tory MPs as he rejected claims he was not fit for office. Sir Keir Starmer highlighted Tory divisions over Mr Johnson's style and rumours of a rift with Mr Sunak. The Labour boss hit out: ""The Prime Minister's routine is falling flat. ""His Chancellor is worried that people are getting wise, his backbenchers say it's embarrassing... and senior people in Downing Street tell the BBC 'it's just not working'."" Echoing the question asked by a journalist on Monday, Sir Keir said: ""Is everything OK, Prime Minister?"" The Prime Minister responded: ""I'll tell you what's not working, it's that line of attack."""
34,34,The Sun,Harry ColeJonathan ReillyNatasha ClarkNick Gutteridge,Boris Johnson accuses French of allowing migrant smugglers to ‘get away with murder’,"BORIS Johnson last night accused the French of letting migrant smugglers ""get away with murder"". Amid the unfolding tragedy in the Channel, the PM said current efforts to prevent the flow of small boats have not been enough. Britain has already paid France £54million to stem the Channel crossing tide. And the PM insisted Britain is ready with further support for the French authorities — an offer which has so far been shunned. France's President Macron has been described as having ""blood on his hands"" by playing politics in the Channel. It comes as: Mr Johnson said there had been difficulties in persuading the French to act against people trafficking gangs. He said: ""There is no doubt at all the gangs concerned unless they are shown that their business model won't work, will continue to deceive people, to put lives at risk and get away with murder. ""We've had difficulties persuading some of our partners, particularly the French, to do things in a way that we think the situation deserves. ""Our offer is to increase our support but also to work together on the beaches. ""That's something I hope will be acceptable now."" This morning the immigration minister Kevin Foster said the UK is ready to offer more support if France changes its mind. He pointed out that British police already operate on French soil at Calais and the Eurostar terminal in Paris carrying out passport checks. And he said: ""We're prepared to offer resources we're prepared to offer literally people to ho there and help and assist the French authorities."" He also urged the EU to drop its opposition to a returns agreement which would help put an end to the ""evil"" smuggling trade. Mr Foster said the Government is pressing ahead with plans to introduce life sentences for people smugglers and urged Labour to back the move. But he said ministers aren't considering setting up centres in Northern France where migrants could apply for asylum without getting on boats. He said that would only encourage more people to head to Europe via the deadly Mediterranean route which claims thousands of lives a year. Instead he insisted the solution is to open up more legal routes for asylum from war zones like Afghanistan. He added: ""We're even working to see how we can open up some more economic migration routes to those who are stuck in refugee camps in regions of conflict."" But today French interior minister Gerald Darmanin appeared to try and blame the UK for yesterday's tragedy. He accused Priti Patel of ""bad immigration management"" and said Britain must change its work and welfare wars to stop being an ""El Dorado"" for migrants. And he also pointed the finger at Belgium and Germany for not doing enough to stop people reaching the beaches of Northern France. He said: ""It's an international problem. We tell our Belgian, German and British friends they should help us fight traffickers that work at an international level."" Meanwhile, MPs and campaigners slammed the French, with Nigel Farage saying: ""I have warned this was inevitable. ""Both France and the UK have blood on their hands."" Conservative MP Jacob Young said: ""These deaths must be a wake up call to the French Government."""
35,35,The Sun,Harry Cole,Labour vows to do nothing in any future referendum on Northern Ireland to the horror of unionists,"LABOUR vowed to do nothing in any future referendum on Northern Ireland — to the horror of unionists last night. Party leader Sir Keir Starmer backed his Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Louise Haigh after she said: ""If there is a border poll, we should remain neutral."" She continued: ""It's not my job to be a persuader of the Union."" Following a backlash, Labour said it was their long-standing position — and that the terms of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement outlawed the UK Government taking a side. But the Northern Ireland Office criticised the claim, hitting back: ""There is no stipulation within the Good Friday Agreement that the UK Government must remain neutral."" Ex-DUP First Minister Arlene Foster said: ""Clearly, Labour needs to re-read the Belfast Agreement."" Last night a Tory source said: ""With the SDLP as their sister party, and their shadow NI Secretary saying it is not her role to be a 'persuader for the Union', how can they claim to be Unionist party with a straight face?"""
36,36,The Sun,Harry Cole,Nigel Farage threatens return to politics over Britain’s migrant crisis,"NIGEL Farage is threatening to make a shock return to politics over the migrants crisis. The ex-Ukip and Brexit Party boss claims anger over illegal Channel crossings has left the public hating Boris Johnson. Mr Farage, furious at the Home Office's failure to stop the tide of small boats, says Westminster has become a tinderbox, with senior Tories tearing into each other. He insisted: ""The migrant crisis hasn't even started — the numbers are only going to go up and up and up."" Mr Farage said he was being begged by donors and voters to make a return — and he was giving it serious thought. He warned ministers that voters and Tory members were losing faith in the Government. Mr Farage said: ""This was meant to be an era of hope, this was meant to be Brexit Britain. It's not just migrants, it's Net Zero and taxes, too."" His intervention came as Home Secretary Priti Patel was put under new pressure over the crossings. Tory grandee Sir Edward Leigh said: ""Us Brexiteers told the people at the referendum we would take back control. ""It's clear in this we've lost control."" He wants emergency powers to put the arrivals in secure accommodation. France is spending more than £9million of UK cash on 100 vehicles to stop crossings. But 25,772 migrants have reached Britain this year."
37,37,The Sun,Harry Cole,Royals and senior ministers set to snub Beijing Winter Olympics as Britain’s stance towards China hardens,"SENIOR ministers and Royals are set to snub the Beijing Winter Olympics in a dramatic hardening in Britain's stance towards China. Boris Johnson last week called together the National Security Council to hammer out policy on the superpower, The Sun can reveal. Following the long session, the PM said China was never going to ""evolve towards"" being a free-market democracy and ""we should be clear-eyed about that"". There has also been grave concern this week over the fate of missing Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai, who criticised the regime. Royals and ministers are under pressure not to attend the February Games in protest. Downing Street sources insist no decision has been made — and there is the added complication that Princess Anne sits on the Olympics governing body. But Cabinet sources suggest a snub is on the cards. One said: ""We won't be going with bells and whistles, perhaps sending a very junior minister at most."" Other sources suggest a broader snub is the cards although would perhaps not be announced publicly. There are claims that while some in Mr Johnson's team such as Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and Deputy PM Dominic Raab are pushing for a major snub, they have been met by resistance so far from Mr Johnson. Security chiefs warned the PM relations with the Beijing regime will never recover from Covid lies, dire human rights abuses and escalating espionage attacks. Speaking in Washington DC yesterday, Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ""We in the UK will no longer tolerate the brazen way we have seen our national security subject to attacks. ""This includes activity by state or state-backed organisations in Russia, China and Iran."" Last night No10 declined to comment on the work of the National Security Council."
38,38,The Sun,Harry Cole,Forcing teens into marriage will become criminal offence under tough new law drafted,"FORCING teens into marriage will become a criminal offence under a tough new law drafted. Ministers are already plotting to raise the legal age to wed from 16 to 18 by removing parental consent. But a new clause will clamp down on arranged marriages by making it a specific crime for children, The Sun can reveal. The Government will throw their weight behind Pauline Latham's Private Member's Bill today in a victory for campaigners who say the law isn't tough enough to stop abusive parents from taking advantage of their kids. The bill will expand the definition of forced marriage so it's illegal to arrange the marriage of anyone under 18, even if the child consents to it. Throwing his weight behind the calls, Deputy Prime Minister, Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, Dominic Raab said last night: ""Forced child marriage ruins lives. ""We back this Bill to keep vulnerable young people safe, by raising the legal age of marriage to 18, and closing gaps in the law which leave them at risk."" Almost 3,000 forced marriage protection orders have been issued since 2014 to protect children but the number of under 18s looking to marry continued to decline."
39,39,The Sun,Harry ColeJack Elsom,Just five migrants who crossed Channel this year have been deported,"JUST five migrants who crossed the Channel in small boats this year have been deported. A massive 23,000 have made the crossing in the last 12 months. But Home Office minister Tom Pursglove confessed only a handful had been deported — taking aim at the EU for refusing to continue with a returns policy after Brexit. However, he claimed 19,000 crossings had been thwarted. Almost a third of those making the journey were Iranian. Also giving evidence to MPs yesterday, Home Office official Dan O'Mahoney said two-thirds of migrants who land at Dover had spent less than a day in France — after being whisked there via the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. Last night Tory MPs confronted the PM about the lack of action stopping the crossings. Boris Johnson has proposed a ""boomerang approach"" using offshore processing hubs. Ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said there is a ""complete lack of grip on illegal immigration. Boris must make it his number-one priority"". Meanwhile, France sparked a new war of words last night by rejecting a pledge to stop all crossings. Home Secretary Priti Patel and  opposite number Gerald Darmanin had vowed to make the route unviable. But the French Embassy in London said the 100 per cent figure ""should not be presented as an agreed commitment. It is not""."
40,40,The Sun,Harry ColeJerome Starkey,UK troops armed with cutting-edge missiles may head to Saudi Arabia to combat air attacks on oil fields,"THE ARMY has drawn up secret plans to send troops to Saudi Arabia armed with cutting-edge Martlet missiles which can shoot down swarming drones. Gunners from the Royal Artillery would swoop into the capital Riyadh despite human rights concerns. Around two dozen air defence specialists would deploy with mobile missile batteries mounted on Stormer light tanks. The plans, due to be announced next week, would mean a major boost to British firepower after soldiers deployed in secret last year with radars but no missiles. ""This is a change in capability,"" a defence source said. ""The Saudis want us there because they like the UK standing with them."" Martlet lightweight missiles are the Army's newest air defence weapon. They are designed to shoot down drones which Iranian-backed Houthi rebels have used to target Saudi oil fields. Britain sent 25 troops from 16 Regiment Royal Artillery to man a Giraffe early warning radar in Riyadh, after attacks on the kingdom's oil fields cut production in half in 2019. The mission was kept under wraps for eight months as Saudi's de facto ruler Mohammed bin Salman was accused of killing thousands of civilians in the war in neighbouring Yemen and the CIA said he ordered the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The Lib Dems slammed the plans as ""deeply concerning"". Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Layla Moran MP said: ""The Saudi regime's human rights record is atrocious. ""We should be sending greater humanitarian aid to the region, not more powerful weapons of war."" Gunners from 16 Regiment Royal Artillery flew out to Riyadh in Feb 2020 on what was originally supposed to be a short term mission. If the current plans are approved they will be replaced by soldiers from their sister regiment 12 Royal Artillery, based on Thorney Island, Hants. The MoD said: ""No decisions have been made on future air defence deployments to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, who are a valued partner and essential to supporting the national security of the UK."" A defence source said deployments were constantly reviewed to ensure ""value for money for the taxpayer""."
41,41,The Sun,Harry ColeJonathan Reilly,Liverpool bomber ‘exploited’ Britain’s broken asylum system before attempt to blow up hospital,"TAXI suicide bomber Emad Al-Swealmeen was able to use Britain's broken asylum process for seven years before his attempt to blow up a hospital. And last night Priti Patel said the case was a ""complete reflection of how dysfunctional and how broken the system has been in the past"". The Home Secretary insisted the circumstances leading up to Sunday's atrocity, when Al-Swealmeen, 32, triggered his device outside Liverpool Women's Hospital, highlighted ""the type of changes that I want to bring forward"". Ms Patel, speaking as she flew to Washington DC, said: ""It's a complete merry-go-round and it has been exploited. A whole sort of professional legal services industry has based itself on rights of appeal, going to the courts day-in day-out at the expense of the taxpayers through legal aid. That is effectively what we need to change."" Ms Patel added: ""These people have come to our country and abused British values, abused the values of the fabric of our country and our society. ""And as a result of that, there's a whole industry that thinks it's right to defend these individuals that cause the most appalling crimes against British citizens, devastating their lives, blighting communities — and that is completely wrong."" Senior MPs vowed to launch a formal probe into fake Christian converts duping the Church of England to avoid being deported back to strict Muslim countries. Al-Swealmeen had been locked in an asylum row with the Home Office since 2014 but his claim was rejected with no grounds of appeal in 2017. That was the year he became a Christian, but he was not deported. Those who knew him have claimed he had been sectioned due to some mental health incident where he was waving a knife at people from an overpass — and this was a possible reason for his bid being denied. But other asylum seekers have been accused of ""playing the religious card"" to stay in the UK. Liverpool Cathedral's own clergyman the Rev Mohammad Eghtedarian had raised the alarm in 2016 that ""plenty of people"" were pretending to convert to help their case for staying in Britain. He said then: ""There are many people abusing the system — I'm not ashamed of saying that. People are desperate for a better life and sometimes they will lie for it, that's understandable."" A year later, Al-Swealmeen was christened at the same church. And it appears that he was helped innocently by devoted Christians Malcolm and Elizabeth Hitchott, a Liverpool couple, to convert from Islam. He was believed to be a Jordanian national who spent much of his life in Iraq before moving to the North West of England. Christian converts are persecuted across the Middle East, and face death if caught, meaning the threat can be used to boost an application to stay in the UK. But former ministers, MPs and campaigners yesterday said the Government is not doing enough. Tim Loughton, a senior Tory MP on the Home Affairs Select Committee, warned: ""There is a worrying new development where it appears certain asylum seekers are playing the religious card to avoid deportation to certain countries."" There is a worrying new development where it appears certain asylum seekers are playing the religious card to avoid deportation to certain countries. And he vowed to launch a Commons investigation into the loophole, saying: ""This is gaming the system and something we must look into."" He added: ""There are very serious questions to be asked about how this man could claim asylum after coming from a safe country and why he was still at liberty seven years on and free to commit this atrocity."" Fellow committee member Labour's Andrew Gwynne said: This attack does raise big questions for this Home Secretary and her predecessors, who have all talked tough on returning failed asylum seekers and tackling foreign nationals who commit crimes in this country."" Alp Mehmet, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said: ""This is a seriously worrying case, which could be the tip of the iceberg. ""It points to the dysfunctional depths into which our shattered asylum system has sunk. Why this person was not removed or detained having been denied asylum is utterly baffling. We need to know."" Last night Liverpool Bishop Cyril Ashton admitted he had conducted the dead terrorist's confirmation. Why this person was not removed or detained having been denied asylum is utterly baffling. We need to know. He added: ""The church takes confirmation seriously and I know that he would have been thoroughly prepared with an understanding of the Christian faith. It seems that, sadly, despite this grounding, the bomber chose a different path for his life."" Downing Street said: ""We want to take steps to speed up the removal of those with no right to be in the UK and streamline the appeals and judicial process which can be used to frustrate removal. ""Clearly we think the approach needs to be improved. It's something the Home Secretary is focused on."""

The ex-Scotland Yard top cop sounded the alarm as spy chiefs raised the UK's terror threat to severe following the Remembrance Day blast. Poppy Day bomber Emad Jamil Al-Swealmeen, 32, blew himself up outside a hospital seconds before a two-minute silence for Britain's war dead at 11am. Security officials have warned of more possible lone wolf terror attacks during the festive period. Spy bosses say it is ""highly likely"" fanatics will attempt atrocities in the wake of the  hospital bomb bid. Yesterday, they raised the terror risk in the UK from ""substantial"" to ""severe"" — amid warnings that crowded places such as festive markets could be targeted. One ex-counter-terror commander warned that fears of a bombing offensive next month may be why the threat level was hiked. The former Scotland Yard chief told The Telegraph: ""It is almost certainly linked to Christmas. ""This could be the first of several. It is hard to believe it is a one-off."" Home Secretary Priti Patel said the decision was taken because Sunday's strike was ""the second in a month"". It followed the slaying of Tory MP Sir David Amess at a constituency surgery in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, on October 15. Boris Johnson said the car blast at Liverpool Women's Hospital was ""a stark reminder of the need for us all to remain utterly vigilant"". But the job of the security services' has been made much harder by an increase in lone wolf attackers not on watch lists or known to MI5.

Someone who might not seem to pose a risk today, might suddenly decide to carry out an attack tomorrow Dr Dan Lomas, Lecturer in intelligence and security studies at Brunel University, said: ""Someone who might not seem to pose a risk today, might suddenly decide to carry out an attack tomorrow."" He says Britain faces a major threat from the rise in 'Nike' terrorists - nicknamed because they ""just do it"" with little warning and are almost impossible to track. ""It really comes at little surprise that budgets and staffing are stretched at a time when the number of potential targets remain the same or increasing. ""In complex plots, including numerous people, it can be easier to pick up chatter that results in arrests."" Rings of steel have been put around Christmas markets in the past to foil vehicle attacks. In 2017, terror fears led to increased security at Winter Wonderland in London's Hyde Park. Earlier this year, MI5 boss Ken McCallum said: ""Our job is to deal with a one in a million case. Where the living room is a terrorist living room."""

Senior Government figures heaped responsibility on ""no mark"" EU negotiator Frans Timmerman, who has been branded the ""missing man"". He was slammed for allowing the Chinese and the Indians to change ""phase out"" to ""phase down"" on coal use. It was nodded through by the EU and US to avoid a total collapse.

45,45,The Sun,Harry Cole,"Boris Johnson takes swipe at EU, France and China for bringing shame on world during pandemic","BORIS Johnson last night took swipes at Brussels, France and China. The PM told the Lord Mayor's Banquet in London that ""squabbles over PPE"" brought shame on a world grappling with Covid — a dig at the EU. He also urged the bloc to end its reliance on Russia for gas supplies. He said leaders came together for last week's COP26 summit helped ""by collective embarrassment at the way internationalism failed during Covid"". Blasting the French, the PM hit out at ""crazy decisions of some countries to try to stop the export of vaccines to others"". And in a dig at the Chinese with a plea for Western unity, he said: ""It's clear some countries are simply not going to evolve towards free market democracies."" And he said allies must come together to tackle that threat. He told the gathered dignitaries at London's Guildhall: ""We have to deal with it, we have to manage it, we must have relations that are as friendly and pragmatic as possible. ""But the consequence is that we work ever more closely with those who do share our values and instincts."" BORIS Johnson last night vowed to ""stand behind"" Jersey and help it fight off French fishing threats. Paris said it would restrict energy supplies unless St Helier gives more trawling licences. The PM blasted the ""unjustified"" ultimatums in talks with the Crown Dependency isle's chief minister John Le Fondre. No10 said: ""The PM reiterated the UK would continue to stand behind Jersey in the event threats were carried out."""
46,46,The Sun,Harry ColeKate FergusonJerome StarkeyNick Pisa,Three MPs accused of ‘lack of respect’ for troops by boozing on official Armistice Day flight,"THREE MPs are accused of showing a ""lack of respect"" for our troops by drinking on an official Armistice Day flight. One Labour member and two SNP pals, David Linden and Drew Hendry, allegedly started their binge at Heathrow before flying to Gibraltar for the commemorations. The trio, who were in a party of 15 MPs as part of the Armed Forces Parliamentary Scheme, are said to have become ""lairy"". One witness said: ""It looked like they were going on a stag do."" But the Labour MP denied matters got out of hand, claiming: ""Everyone had had a few drinks on the flight. ""The issue for me is the medication I am taking. That affected my tolerance. I had the same amount to drink as the others. I do not know how many drinks I had — I wasn't counting. It was less than five."" That MP is understood to have missed official visits yesterday morning, including a meeting with Gibraltar's Chief Minister Fabian Picardo — though the SNP pair did take part. A parliamentary staffer was so alarmed by the trio's behaviour that they raised the matter back with the chairman of the Armed Forces scheme, Conservative MP James Gray. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace is said to have erupted in fury when he heard — and vowed to write to Labour and the SNP to ""express his disappointment"". He added: ""This type of behaviour shows a lack of respect for the enduring work of our Armed Forces. ""The scheme is an opportunity for both parliamentarians and the military to understand each other. This puts military personnel in a difficult position and risks undermining respect for Parliament."" Another source claimed the SNP pair went into a rage when local health officials on the Rock questioned their Covid documents. The insider added: ""They b****ck us for bad behaviour and then they go and do this. It's staggering."" Army officers are said to have intervened to tell the MPs that their behaviour was unacceptable. Mr Gray claimed the Labour MP ""over-imbibed'' on the journey and the other two ""were also imbibing but not as drunk"". He added: ""I will be having a word with the Labour MP on Monday and saying, 'Look, what happened here?'."" He did say the MPs were in their own time and the visit did not start officially until Wednesday. Mr Gray added: ""Had they got drunk in an officers' mess, that would be my responsibility and I would, without question, dismiss the Labour MP from the course. I can't remember a single occasion where anything like this occurred on one of our visits. ""As it is, in their own private life, they chose to get drunk on her way to a visit. But I'll have a chat with the person about whether or not they feel comfortable continuing on the course."" Rounding on the three politicians for their unprofessional behaviour, Mr Gray added: ""I can't remember a single occasion where anything like this occurred on one of our visits. They may have a glass of wine in the officers' mess on an evening but they are very hard working visits."" Mr Gray said a staffer had called him on Tuesday night to warn him of the problem. An SNP spokesman said: ""These suggestions are inaccurate. ""Drew Hendry MP and David Linden MP were honoured to be invited to this important event and attended all engagements, including the welcome meeting and dinner shortly after landing. ""Instead of trying to divert attention from the Tory corruption scandal engulfing Westminster, Ben Wallace should be apologising for his role in it, including voting to get Owen Paterson off the hook."""

The embattled Tory ex-Cabinet minister is under fire for raking in hundreds of thousands of pounds for legal advice dished out to the British Virgin Islands. He took advantage of lockdown rules to vote remotely so he could stay in the overseas territory dishing out lucrative advice to the government in an inquiry over allegations of criminal activity. The shocking revelations has seen the knives came out for multi-millionaire Sir Geoffrey back home. A senior diplomatic source told The Sun: ""Cox has spent his time in the Caribbean trying to hinder an investigation systemic corruption, cronyism, jury intimidation and misuse of public funds.  It's shocking he's chosen to put himself on the side of those accused of corruption."" While he has clocked up the hours advising the British overseas territory, Sir Geoffrey, a former Attorney General, has only spoken in Parliament once this entire year. While he is not believed to have broken any rules, government insiders are furious that he has been caught out spending up to 41 hours a month on his second job. The PM's spokesman slapped Sir Geoffrey down for spending so long in his second job. In pointed remarks, the PM's spokesman said an ""MP's primary job is and must be to serve their constituents and to represent their interests in Parliament"". He added: ""They should be visible in their constituencies and available to help constituents with their constituency matters. ""If they're not doing that, they're not doing their job and will rightly be judged on that by their constituents."" A Whitehall insider added: ""I think he will have got the message."" The revelations has sparked a fresh clamour for a crackdown on MPs second jobbing."
48,48,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha Clark,Boris Johnson to flee Tory party sleaze woes by bolting back to COP26 in Glasgow,"BORIS Johnson will today flee Tory party sleaze woes by bolting back to the COP26 summit in Glasgow. His dodge comes after he was branded chicken on Monday for swerving a Commons showdown. Last night, the PM canned plans for a Cabinet away day tomorrow at his country retreat of Chequers and will instead host an emergency Downing Street get-together. Mr Johnson had been expected to return to Scotland this weekend for the end of the climate talks. But he was set to arrive there this morning — this time taking the train after a row about his use of a private jet last week. The moves come after he tried to rip up the current parliamentary standards system to block the suspension of pal Owen Paterson over a lobbying scandal. No10 then oversaw a U-turn amid the resulting fury, and Mr Paterson quit as an MP. A senior Tory MP told The Sun: ""It must be bad when the PM sees Scotland as safer than Downing Street."" With a climate deal hanging in the balance, Mr Johnson will ask world powers to set aside differences and turn vague promises into action. Huge sticking points remain on a timeline for slashing emissions. One source warned: ""We're in for a fight."" The PM said: ""Negotiating teams are doing the hard yards in these final days of COP26."" Saudi Arabia, China and India were accused of ""naked and cynical attempts"" to water down messages about humanity's impact on the planet, fossil fuels, and greenhouse gases driving global warming. Jennifer Morgan, Executive Director, Greenpeace International raged: ""No country is immune to the catastrophic threat of rising temperatures, Saudi Arabia included, while the Gulf region is rich in renewable energy potential."" Meanwhile, ministers confirmed they would ban all new petrol and diesel lorries being sold in the UK by 2040. Some 24 countries have joined the move to insist on hydrogen or electric powered trucks instead. A spokesperson said: No10: ""The Prime Minister is going up to meet negotiators, to get an update on progress in the talks and encourage ambitious action in the final days of the negotiations."""
49,49,The Sun,Harry ColeKate FergusonJonathan Reilly,Twelve MPs rake in whopping £3.5million in just two years on top of £81k salaries,"PARLIAMENT'S top dozen earners have raked in more than £3.5million in just two years on top of their £81,932 salaries, The Sun can reveal. As the row over MPs' extra earnings exploded in the wake of the Owen Paterson scandal, Boris Johnson was mocked for swerving a Commons showdown. The PM fled to Northumberland as MPs slammed his efforts to save the ex-Cabinet minister. Boris was brutally mocked by MPs, with cries of ""run, Boris, run"", after he ducked the emergency session triggered in the wake of the Owen Paterson scandal. Amid the furore over second jobs, The Sun can reveal 12 MPs have made more than £3.5million in outside earnings in just two years. Yesterday, top earner Sir Geoffrey Cox unveiled a new £400,000 a year gig with a law firm, while Health Secretary Sajid Javid raked in £366,000 during a brief spell on the backbenches. Ex-PM Theresa May has earned £760,000 from after-dinner speeches since quitting No10. The Sun probe revealed 11 of the dirty dozen are Tories, with Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey in 12th spot. MPs' outside earnings have been thrust into the spotlight after Boris's attempt to save Mr Paterson from a 30-day suspension after he lobbied for private companies that paid him more than £100,000. Raging Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the PM of leading his party ""through the sewers and the stench lingers"". He added: ""Enough is enough. We will not stand by while he trashes our democracy."" It came as Labour nudged ahead in one opinion poll yesterday, the first time the party has taken the lead since the vaccine rollout. On a visit to Hexham hospital, Northumberland, yesterday, Mr Johnson refused to apologise for attempting to save Mr Paterson. Asked why he was dodging the debate, he said: ""Unfortunately I can't be there because I had a long-standing engagement here."""
50,50,The Sun,Jemma CarrJack ElsomHarry ColeKate Ferguson,Ministers brush off Owen Paterson sleaze scandal as ‘storm in a teacup’ after Boris Johnson’s screeching U-turn,"GEORGE Eustice has brushed off the Owen Paterson sleaze scandal as just a ""storm in a teacup"" after Boris Johnson performed a screeching U-turn. The Environment Secretary acknowledged that the Government had ""made a mistake"" when trying to get sleaze-mired Paterson's breach of lobbying rules re-examined by a new Tory-majority committee. But, when asked whether he accepted that the Government was in trouble over ""sleaze"" claims, Mr Eustice told Trevor Phillips on Sky News: ""I don't agree."" He added: ""What we've seen is a sort of storm in a teacup if I may say so. Yes we made a mistake in bringing that forward in the way that we did, so we withdrew it. ""But the overall principle, that you should have due process and a right of appeal in these types of situations, I don't think anybody doubts."" Eustice also suggested the PM was directly involved in the plan to save Paterson. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr: ""I wasn't involved in the decisions in No 10 on this. ""The truth is, I suspect, that on an issue as important as this there would have been a discussion between Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Leader of the House, and also the Chief Whip and the Prime Minister and other advisers. ""That's how these sorts of decisions are made."" His comments come as the PM's approval ratings took a shocking hit today. The latest Opinium survey puts the Tories just one point ahead Labour after their tumultuous week which saw Mr Johnson's humiliating bid to save Mr Paterson explode in his face. A tidal wave of fury forced the Prime Minister into junking plans to tear up anti-corruption rules to save his pal's political career. It meant the former Environment Secretary faced a Commons ban for lobbying ministers and officials for two firms that paid him more than £100,000 a year. Within hours of Thursday's shock U-turn, Mr Paterson dramatically quit as a Tory MP — claiming that he could not get a fair hearing. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer today blasted Mr Johnson as corrupt - and said the PM is ""leading his troops through the sewer"". He told Marr: ""Instead of upholding standards, he ordered his MPs to protect his mate and rip up the whole system - that is corrupt, it is contemptible and it's not a one-off."" Asked about Mr Johnson's future, Sir Keir said he is ""angry"" as the reputation of the country and democracy is being ""trashed"" by the Prime Minister. He went on: ""When there was sleaze in the mid-1990s John Major rolled up his sleeves and he put in place the Nolan Committee on Standards in Public Life - so he was the prime minister who said 'I will clear this up'. ""Boris Johnson is the Prime Minister who is leading his troops through the sewer - he's up to his neck in this."" Mr Johnson is also seeing opposition from within his own party, as Tory MP Robert Largan rejected Mr Eustice's ""storm in a teacup"" assessment. He told Times Radio: ""I don't think it's very helpful to say 'oh, it's just a storm in a teacup'. ""In my view, this was something that we got badly wrong."" Mr Paterson's shock resignation means a byelection will now be fought in the safe Conservative seat of North Shropshire. He said in a fiery parting shot that the past few days have been ""intolerable"" for him and his family — and so he had decided to walk. The chaos infuriated his own party with one MP branding the saga a ""total s*** show"" that left the Conservatives ""looking like idiots"". They added: ""We look like pigs with our snouts in the trough."" And a senior minister fumed: ""All of this pushes the sleaze button. We have been getting a ton of angry emails. It all just looks like we're back to the 1990s — MPs getting together to support their friends."" The astonishing goings-on had seen Boris on Wednesday wield his huge majority to ditch Parliament's anti-sleaze rules and secure a temporary reprieve for Mr Paterson. The Tory MP for North Shropshire had faced being kicked out of Parliament for 30 sitting days and having to fight a by-election after being found guilty of lobbying ministers. Boris had tried to ram through plans to throw out the rules and create an appeals panel dominated by Tories. But the hugely controversial move, which overturned the findings of anti-corruption tsar Kathryn Stone, sparked a massive backlash — spooking the PM. Amid a flood of accusations that the Tories were ""wallowing in sleaze"", Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng pulled the short straw and was sent to defend the plan. He said Mr Paterson had been the ""victim"" and suggested Ms Stone should quit as politicians were ""overturning"" the process. But while he was defending the move, Mr Johnson was already thrashing out plans for his U-turn. The PM was shocked at the sheer scale of the backlash and furious at Mr Paterson's lack of contrition. Just after 10.30am, Cabinet Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg told MPs in the Commons that the Government would drop its proposal. He admitted the attempt to rip up the regulations would flop after Labour and the SNP had promised to boycott the new body. Instead, he said No 10 would seek cross-party talks while Mr Paterson's case and punishment would go back to the Commons for another vote."
51,51,The Sun,Harry Cole,Tory MPs at war as blame over Owen Paterson sleaze scandal sparks tensions,"TORY party chiefs were locked in a Bonfire Night war of words as fireworks flew over who was to blame for the disastrous Owen Paterson U-turn. Boris Johnson and his Chief Whip Mark Spencer, as well as Commons leader Jacob Rees Mogg, were all slammed by MPs and ministers over the sleaze saga. Yesterday the disgraced MP formally quit the Commons paving the way for a testy by-election in North Shropshire. But back in Westminster class war erupted, with the 2019 intake of Tory MPs said to be particularly angry at being ordered through the division lobbies to try to delay Mr Paterson's 30 day suspension over breaching lobbying rules. One said: ""All the toffs versus towns stuff is back. The 2019 intake is very different from the country-gent old guard, and we find it very patronising when told what to do by them."" Tensions peaked on Wednesday night with one newbie MP calling the embattled Mr Paterson a four letter word to his face. And there were bitter blows traded at the very top of Government after allies of the ex-Cabinet Minister said the doomed amendment to re-model Commons rules was written ""at the heart of No10"". In a day of claim and counterclaim, Downing Street sources rejected that and instead pointed the finger of blame at Jacob Rees Mogg for conjuring up the plan. But the Commons leader's allies insisted he had the full support and blessing of Mr Johnson to try find a way to save Mr Paterson - saying he ""served only at the Prime Minister's pleasure."" However anger boiled over, with one minister branding Mr Rees-Mogg's amendment ""fatally flawed"" as opposition parties immediately refused to cooperate. They told The Sun: ""Just because you can speak Latin and know your Tudor history it doesn't make you some master strategist."" And there was anger aimed at Chief Whip Mark Spencer for ""overselling the level of support Paterson had in the party"" and pressurising the PM to back the extraordinary effort to save the doomed ex-Cabinet Minister. Last night Downing Street were also under-fire for refusing to formally rule out giving Mr Paterson a peerage. However one insider said a gong was ""never going to happen."""
52,52,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson reeling from his most painful U-turn yet — with all sides of his party turning fire on No10,"BORIS Johnson was last night reeling from his most painful U-turn yet — with all sides of his party turning fire on No10. Comparisons were drawn with last year's debacle over free school meals pitting ministers against footie star Marcus Rashford. It was followed by doomed attempts to save then Health Secretary Matt Hancock and dithering over lockdowns. Mr Johnson is known for his desire not to throw colleagues to the wolves or bow to media pressure. But his aborted bid to save pal Owen Paterson risks being his most damaging climbdown so far. The PM is left with a Tory Party once again at war with itself and Labour cries of ""one rule for them"" starting to land a blow. Paterson allies feel bruised No10 withdrew its support. And serving ministers have been made to look like fools by following orders against their better judgment — none more than Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng. He was out on the airwaves still defending a tawdry effort to bypass Common's sleaze busters to save Mr Paterson while the No10 team were bunkered down plotting the about-turn yesterday morning. The Sun can reveal the divisions have reached the core of Mr Johnson's closest team who were deeply divided over saving Mr Paterson. While Chief Whip Mark Spencer and some political aides convinced the PM he could get away with the stunt, spin doctors and Chief of Staff Dan Rosenfeld were begging him not to do it. Mr Johnson, in Italy for the G20 and Glasgow for COP26, returned to a plan his Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg, a close pal of Paterson, assured him was watertight. Sympathetic to the tragedy of Mr Paterson's wife's suicide, the PM sided with the Brexiteer, a decision he must now sorely regret. But it is not the first time Mr Johnson has got it badly wrong when it comes to protecting allies. He came to rue standing by controversial aide Dominic Cummings over breaking lockdown rules — only to be punished when the adviser went rogue. Mr Cummings yesterday repeated his charge that the PM is a ""broken shopping trolley"" veering out of control. Sore Tory ministers and MPs might now have a little sympathy with that description."

Just after 10.30am, Cabinet Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg told MPs in the Commons that the Government would drop its proposal. He admitted the attempt to rip up the regulations would flop after Labour and the SNP had promised to boycott the new body. Instead, he said No 10 would seek cross-party talks while Mr Paterson's case and punishment would go back to the Commons for another vote. One Tory said: ""Kwasi was like a lamb to the slaughter. It was awful."" By the end of lunchtime, Mr Paterson had quit, saying he was ""unable to clear my name under the current system"". I am very sad that Parliament will lose the services of Owen Paterson who has been a friend and colleague of mine for decades. The ex-Cabinet minister, 65, who says his wife Rose was driven to suicide by the probe against him, and that her death last year had been ""mocked"" and his pain ""belittled"". The dad-of-three added: ""My children have asked me to leave politics, for my sake as well as theirs. I agree with them. I do not want my wife's memory and reputation to become a political football. Above all, I always put my family first."" Mr Johnson responded: ""I am very sad that Parliament will lose the services of Owen Paterson who has been a friend and colleague of mine for decades."" But as the starting gun was fired on a North Shropshire by-election — where the Tories have a thumping 23,000 majority, many Conservatives were left raging. Their targets were for chief whip Mark Spencer and Mr Rees-Mogg, with MPs accusing them of egging the PM on with his ""stupid"" plan. One senior Tory said: ""It has been a total shshow. He looks like an idiot, and we all look like idiots. How dumb do you have to be? ""The problem with Boris is that he packs his Cabinet with second-rate people, meaning that there is no one to tell him he should take a different course."" Other MPs accused the ""spineless"" Cabinet of not having the guts to tell the PM it was a bad idea. Andrea Leadsom, who put forward the amendment to change the sleaze rules, admitted: ""I regret what happened yesterday"". THE last two years have been an indescribable nightmare for my family and me. My integrity, which I hold very dear, has been repeatedly and publicly questioned. I maintain that I am totally innocent of what I have been accused of and I acted at all times in the interests of public health and safety. I, my family and those closest to me know the same. I am unable to clear my name under the current system. Far, far worse than having my honesty questioned was, of course, the suicide of my beloved and wonderful wife, Rose. She was everything to my children and me. We miss her everyday and the world will always be grey, sad and ultimately meaningless without her. The last few days have been intolerable for us. Worst of all was seeing people, including MPs, publicly mock and deride Rose's death and belittle our pain. My children have therefore asked me to leave politics altogether, for my sake as well as theirs. I agree with them. I do not want my wife's memory and reputation to become a political football. Above all, I always put my family first. This is a painful decision but I believe the right one. I will remain a public servant but outside the cruel world of politics."
54,54,The Sun,Harry ColeNick Gutteridge,Sulking Macron left COP26 summit after being snubbed by Boris Johnson for showdown talks over trade war threats,"SULKING Emmanuel Macron sloped back to France after being snubbed by Boris Johnson for a showdown meeting, The Sun can reveal. The grumpy French President left COP26 a whole day before other leaders, shortly after announcing he had delayed his threats to start a trade war with Britain. Mr Macron demanded a face to face sit down with Mr Johnson on Monday evening as tensions over fishing ran high. But Downing Street declined as the PM was hosting the Royal Family at reception for world leaders - where Mr Macron was conspicuously absent. Shortly after flight logs show his private jet speeding toward Paris from Glasgow Airport. French sources insisted the President had always planned to spend just a single day in Scotland and ""nothing"" should be read into the timing of his departure. But Mr Macron's official diary was largely clear for Tuesday, with just a smattering of routine meetings. And his departure came immediately after he made a humiliating climbdown in the ongoing fishing row - stepping back from brink over his threats to trigger a trade war over licences to French boats. Last night Mr Johnson publicly slapped down claims Britain was ready to fold and give more access to our waters, telling The Sun: ""Since you ask about whether the UK has changed its position on the fishing issue, the answer is no."" The diplomatic temper tantrum, already dubbed ""Le Strop"", came as the UK made plans to strip France of its status as Europe's £120bn trade gateway to Britain over Mr Macron's fishing wars sabre-rattling. Ministers are looking at plans to divert goods away from Calais-Dover to ports in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Scandinavia. Industry chiefs have been warning them for years of the need to end our reliance on the short straits and ""promote resilience across the UK"". Transport secretary Grant Shapps yesterday visited Immingham and Grimsby docks, which are among those earmarked for extra trade. Simon Bird, from Associated British Ports, said they're ""faster and cheaper"" than Dover for firms shipping to the Midlands and North. Last night Paris was still sabre-rattling on fishing with sources close to Mr Macron insisting a trade war isn't off the table. Influential MP Bruno Bonnell said the UK was ""bluffing"" with his threat to take legal action if France goes ahead with punishment measures."
55,55,The Sun,Harry ColeNick Gutteridge,Macron in ‘le climbdown’ after threatening Brexit trade war following face-off with Boris in Glasgow,"EMMANUEL Macron last night blinked in his threat to trigger a Brexit trade war after being stared down by Boris Johnson in Glasgow. France's President said crisis talks would continue in Brussels tomorrow - missing his midnight deadline for Britain to fold and give his fishermen more post-Brexit access to UK fishing waters. The temporary surrender came after stern Foreign Secretary Liz Truss warned that France faced legal action by Britain as soon as tonight if they pulled the trigger on threats to punish the UK over Brexit. After crisis talks on Monday night, and another showdown with the PM, Mr Macron abandoned his vow to launch revenge plans tonight - but did not rule out doing so later in the week. He told reporters in Glasgow he had made a new proposal to defuse the row, saying: ""The talks need to continue."" He added: ""We'll see where we are tomorrow at the end of the day, to see if things have really changed."" A source close to the talks claimed Macron had gone from ""le strop to le climbdown"" after being abandoned by EU allies in his hard liner anti-UK stance. Had Mr Macron not climbdown, lorries heading to the UK could have faced extra red tape and checks, risking chaos at Calais and Dover. British trawlers would have also faced more boarding by French cops and been banned from landing their catches at the country's ports. But Mr Macron's own fishermen warned his efforts to punish Britain may do them more harm than good. Skippers have been warned not to venture into UK waters in case they're caught up in a tit-for-tat war over access as Britain warned France will face a ""robust"" response for any action. No 10 had insisted it's ready to face down French threats and urged Paris to drop its punishment plans while there's still time. Furious Liz Truss slammed the ""unwarranted"" threats from Mr Macron and told him: ""We simply won't stand for that."" She accused the French president of ""behaving unfairly"" and showboating to domestic voters, warning Britain won't hesitate to immediately trigger legal action against his country. And she fumed: ""The French have made completely unreasonable threats, including to the Channel Islands and to our fishing industry. ""If somebody behaves unfairly in a trade deal you're entitled to take action against them and seek compensatory measures. ""That's what we'll do if the French don't back down. We are simply not going to roll over in the face of these threats."" A Downing St spokesman said: ""As you would expect, we have robust contingency plans in place. ""It is the French that made these threats and we are continuing to call for them to step back from those threats."""
56,56,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha Clark,Rishi Sunak will commit to have Britain’s £2.2trillion debt falling by next election in Budget for ‘post-Covid’ age,"RISHI Sunak will vow to have Britain's £2.2trillion debt falling by the next election as he unveils his Budget for the ""post-Covid"" age. The Chancellor will call time on the cash splurges of the pandemic. New rules will outlaw borrowing to fund day-to-day government spending within three years. But better-than-expected growth means the axe will not have to fall so hard, meaning cash for ""strong public services, vibrant communities and safer streets"". And the Chancellor will throw red meat to traditional Tories by vowing to tackle the debt mountain. ""Squishy Rishi"" will drive down some department costs and warn ""resilience"" to future financial hits is needed as there are growing fears over inflation. But Paul Johnson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, predicted Mr Sunak would have ""tens of billions"" worth of headroom freeing him up to possibly ease the cost-of-living crisis with some Budget surprises. There were also growing hopes last night he would slash the harsh Universal Credit taper rate. In a win for The Sun's Make Universal Credit Work campaign, the Treasury may let workers keep more of the money they earn and incentivise them to take on extra work. Mr Sunak was due to tell MPs: ""Today's Budget begins the work of preparing for a new economy post-Covid. An economy fit for a new age of optimism."" Meanwhile, the Treasury was at war with the Commons Speaker over Budget leaks — with Sir Lindsay Hoyle expected to reprimand the Chancellor publicly today."
57,57,The Sun,Harry ColeJack ElsomNatasha Clark,Rishi Sunak to ‘raise wages for millions on Universal Credit in Budget surprise’,"MILLIONS of Brits on Universal Credit will be able to keep more of what they earn thanks to a Rishi Sunak Budget surprise, ministers believe. The Chancellor was last night said to be on the cusp of slashing the harsh Universal Credit taper rate that punishes workers. In a win for The Sun's Make Universal Credit Work campaign, the Treasury is set to allow workers to keep more of the money they earn and incentivise people to take on extra work. Better than expected growth figures means the axe will not have to fall so hard at Wednesday's Budget, insiders think. Yesterday, Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said: ""In the short term there is going to be some good news for the Chancellor because the economy has grown faster than projected and that will feed through to the public finances."" The respected economist predicted Mr Sunak would have ""tens of billions"" of headroom freeing him up to possibly ease the cost of living crisis with some Budget rabbits out of the hat. The harsh taper rate effectively taxes Brits 63p in the pound on anything they earn over their base level of benefits - which puts many thousands off applying for better paid jobs or taking on more hours. It's understood that the DWP's main spending review ask - to cut the taper rate down to 60p - will be backed by Rishi's team in an attempt to soften the blow for the lowest paid ahead of a tough winter. One minister said: ""The Chancellor wants to incentivise work, this makes sense."" And a former Cabinet minister said: ""Reform of the taper would be very sensible. ""The present situation penalises taking on more work, the opposite of what Universal Credit is supposed to do."" One insider told the Sun said: ""This isn't about offsetting the end of the uplift. It's about making sure people feel they can work more hours without losing more cash."" The Joseph Rowntree Foundation said the move would benefit 1.7million families, but leaves another 3.8 million facing the full brunt of the cut. Ministers want to swerve a cost of living crisis amid spiralling food and energy bills by hiking the minimum wage and allowing those on benefits to keep more of their pay packets. The package is expected to be worth around £3billion - and will crucially target those who are already working rather than the flat £20 Covid uplift, which was given to everyone. Between the two measures, it's likely that it will more than offset the £1,000 annual cut, which came in last month."
58,58,The Sun,Harry Cole,Rishi Sunak confirms end to public sector pay freeze and minimum wage increase,"RISHI Sunak today confirmed the public sector pay freeze is over for millions of workers and those on the minimum wage will have their pay hiked by £1,000 a year. As The Sun revealed on Monday, up to five million public sector workers like police, soldiers and teachers will get a pay rise for the first time in two years. Exactly how much will be negotiated by sector Pay Review Bodies, but last night nurses again threatened strike action over their 3 per cent offer. But the Chancellor said the stronger than expected recovery from Covid meant it was time to relax the squeeze put on pay during the pandemic - as he also confirmed the new Minimum Wage would be £9.50 an hour. Mr Sunak said: ""The economic impact and uncertainty of the virus meant we had to take the difficult decision to pause public sector pay. ""Now, with the economy firmly back on track, it's right that nurses, teachers and all the other public sector workers who played their part during the pandemic see their wages rise."" Yesterday the Chancellor accepted in full the recommendation of the Low Pay Commission to hike the pay of the lowest-paid workers from £8.91 to £9.50 an hour – an extra £1000 a year for a full-time worker. From 1 April, young people and apprentices will also see their wages boosted as the National Minimum Wage for people aged 21-22 goes up to £9.18 an hour and Apprentice Rate increases to £4.81 an hour."
59,59,The Sun,Harry Cole,Rishi Sunak WON’T increase fuel duty in Budget in victory for Sun’s Keep It Down campaign,"RECORD petrol prices have forced Chancellor Rishi Sunak to ditch a 2.84p budget hike in fuel duty — a win for The Sun's Keep It Down campaign. The average forecourt price per litre hit a record 142.94p on Sunday, with soaring oil prices and retailers blamed for hiking prices. The hated levy was due to go up from 57.95p per litre to 60.79p — potentially costing drivers £66 extra a year per car. But MPs say they have been privately assured by the Treasury that the scheduled 4.9 per cent rise for 2022 will not go ahead. In a major victory for The Sun's ""Keep It Down"" Campaign, the duty will be frozen for the second time this year. Chancellor Rishi Sunak was forced to abandon the planned hike in tomorrow's Budget after petrol prices hit a record high. The average forecourt price per litre hit 142.94p on Sunday, with soaring oil prices and retailers blamed for putting up prices. Yesterday the PM's official spokesman also dropped a massive hint of the move, saying: ""We recognise rising fuel costs are a challenge for the British public."" He urged fuel providers to make sure they put drivers before profits, saying: ""We would always want to see providers ensure they are providing good value to customers."" The RAC said retailers have increased their profit margins by 4p a litre, from around 5.5p in April last year to 8.59p. They claimed smaller, independent ones were trying to rebuild profits after the steep fall in sales prompted by the first UK lockdown last year. But they also say the increase was partly due to a doubling of the oil price since last year. Brent Crude, the international benchmark, now stands at more than $86 a barrel. Some analysts believe the oil price could rise further. This is due to high demand as economies recover from the Covid pandemic — and the Opec-Plus group of oil producing countries not increasing supply. The AA said: ""Whether it's down to oil producers, market speculators, Treasury taxes or struggling retailers trying to balance their margins, record pump prices must be saying to drivers with the means it's time to make the switch to electric."" Its fuel price spokesman Luke Bosdet added: ""As for poorer motorists — many of them now facing daily charges to drive in cities — there is no escape. It's a return to cutting back on other consumer spending, perhaps even heating or food, to keep the car that gets them to work on the road."" The Chancellor has been under huge political pressure not to raise fuel duty. Dozens of MPs from Northern Tory pressure group the NRG wrote to him saying: ""Those in the North rely on cars to go to work, to take their children to school, and to put food on the table. ""Any rise in fuel duty puts a barrier in the way of people accessing well-paying jobs and taking care of their families. Cars for our constituents aren't a luxury Chancellor, they are a necessity."" Last night campaigners urged Mr Sunak to go further and cut the tax. Howard Cox of FairFuelUK said: ""The last 12 months of eye-watering pump prices, seriously made worse by opportunistic fuel supply chain wholesalers, has given the Exchequer an unforeseen VAT windfall of more than £1billion: the equivalent of 3p of fuel duty."" He said the Chancellor could use the extra VAT to reduce the duty. Drivers across the country have voiced fury over the rise in fuel prices. Victoria Bartlett, 49, of Thornhill, Hants, said: ""The prices are ridiculous. ""I have to go to have cancer treatment once a week but every three weeks it's twice a week. I have to be able to do that and my usual errands on £15 a week. If the prices go up any more, I don't know what I'll do."" Lana Fisher, 52, a carer from Southampton, added: ""It feels like a rip off — 140.9p a litre and this is the cheapest one around here."" Dean Cooper, 42, from Croydon, South London said: ""It's ridiculous. It's £1.39 for the cheapest. I'm a dad of eight kids. It's impacting everything. ""It affects day-to-day life. You go abroad, you spend £50 and you fill up a big V8 (engine). Here, £50 wouldn't even fill up a Mini. ""No fuel, no movement. The price of fuel on a low income is dreadful."" WHAT has caused the rise? Key is the jump in the cost of oil, which has doubled from around $40 a barrel a year ago to $85 now. Demand has soared as lockdowns ended. Are forecourts increasing profits too? Yes they are — taking 7.5p per litre, 2p more than at the start of lockdowns. They argue they are making up for lost earnings during lockdowns when demand for unleaded and diesel slumped. What about E10? The new greener fuel uses 10 per cent ethanol rather then five. Since ethanol is more expensive than petrol, it added around a penny a litre to pump prices. Will prices go up after the Budget? Hopefully not. Rishi Sunak has indicated duty will be frozen, but there will not be the cut in VAT motoring groups want. However, the cost of crude oil — a key factor in determining pump prices — could rise further unless supplies are increased by Opec oil producers such as Saudi Arabia. What can I do? If you can't drive less, then use a service like PetrolPrices. com to find the cheapest in your areas. Supermarkets, and Asda in particular, tend to be cheapest."

A pot of £2.6billion has been earmarked to help create more than 30,000 specialist school places over the next three years. The cash marks a major win for our Give It Back campaign, that has been arguing against Government cuts to support for disabled kids. Last night, the Chancellor thanked the thousands of Sun readers who joined our call. He said: ""I welcome The Sun and its readers campaigning on important issues around special educational needs and disabilities. ""I want every child to have the best possible start in life and to fulfil their potential."" Mr Sunak will also use his Budget to announce a network of ""family hubs"" which will offer"
61,61,The Sun,Harry Cole,Salary rises for millions as Rishi Sunak unfreezes public sector pay & hikes minimum wage in Budget,"NEARLY five million Brits will get salary rises as Rishi Sunak unfreezes public sector pay and hikes the national minimum wage. The Chancellor put the squeeze last year on 2.6 million teachers, civil servants and police officers' wages because of Covid. But he will use his Budget this Wednesday to end that pain. And Mr Sunak is expected to hike the minimum wage from £8.91 — with some sources suggesting it could go up to as much as £9.45. That would give the two million or so on rock-bottom figure a £1,000 annual increase for a 35-hour week from next year. The potential five per cent rise comes just weeks after Boris Johnson said Brits deserved to be paid more. And it puts the national minimum wage well on target to hit £10 by the time of the next general election, scheduled for 2024. Currently, Brits aged 23 and over are entitled to be paid a minimum of £8.91 per hour, with a lower sum of £8.36 for 21 and 22-year-olds. The rates are set on advice from the Low Pay Commission, which is due to make their recommendations to Mr Sunak today. The independent expert body has previously hinted a big rise for 2022 is coming but there is concern in the Treasury about the impact on small businesses. The PM told the Conservative Party conference in Manchester this month: ""We are not going back to the same old broken model with low wages, low growth, low skills and low productivity."" And he urged businesses to put up wages. But senior Tories are very aware such a plea would need to be matched by the Government giving support. Shops and hauliers have already been forced to hike wages in an attempt to fill worker shortages. Sainsbury's and Morrisons are both offering above minimum wage as the supermarkets look to hire thousands of Christmas temps. And aspiring lorry drivers have been offered £1,000 joining bonuses and higher wages as firms struggle with the HGV driver shortfall. Mr Sunk, asked if pay was going up, yesterday said: ""We will have to set a new pay policy and that will be a topic for the spending review."" Firms in plea for tax cuts

62,62,The Sun,Harry Cole,Health spending to rise by another £11bn in Budget just weeks after NHS was handed £12bn,"THE Chancellor will hike health spending by another £11billion - just weeks after the NHS was handed another £12billion a year. A £6billion package of funding to help tackle NHS backlogs across England will form a major plank of Wednesday's Budget. And there will be £5billion for cutting edge research and development. The catch up cash will go toward new mobile testing, checks and scan sites for a range of problems - with these appointments currently making up the vast majority of the Covid backlog. As well as providing more checks, tests and scans, and help get waiting lists down, £2.3billion of the funding package will be used to try to transform diagnostic services. The Treasury said there will be at least 100 ""one-stop-shop"" community diagnostic centres across England, including the 44 already announced. These centres are expected to help clear most existing test backlogs caused by the pandemic, including for CT, MRI and ultrasound scans, by the end of the parliament. The Treasury said the additional capacity will also ensure the resilience of the country's diagnostic services in the years to come. It was announced over the weekend that the Department of Health and Social Care will also receive £5billion over the next three years to fund research and development. Health chiefs said last night it will fund genome technology to allow doctors to detect more than 200 conditions in babies, compared with existing tests which can only identify nine. Some £95million of the funding will go towards the Office for Life Sciences to help with cutting-edge innovations to help treat cancer, obesity and mental ill health. Last night Mr Sunak said: ""We are committed to getting health services back on track and ensuring no one is left waiting for vital tests or treatment. ""This is a game-changing investment in the NHS to make sure we have the right buildings, equipment and systems to get patients the help they need and make sure the NHS is fit for the future."" Health and Social Care Secretary, Sajid Javid, said: ""Our phenomenal NHS has worked so hard to keep people safe during the pandemic and we'll do whatever it takes to make sure people are getting the treatment they need as quickly as possible. ""This £6billion investment will support the delivery of millions more checks, scans and procedures for patients across the country."" BRITAIN'S creaking borders are set for a £703million upgrade in Wednesday's budget. The Chancellor is poised to unveil a £75million new fleet of 11 Navy patrol ships to stop illegal Channel crossings. And he will plough £628million into an Electronic Travel Authorisation system. Under the US-style scheme, from 2025 everyone coming to the UK will pay for a travel pass and fill out a security questionnaire."
63,63,The Sun,Harry Cole,Chancellor will become ‘Squishy Rishi’ next week as he puts spending squeeze on Whitehall,"THE Chancellor will become ""Squishy Rishi"" next week as he puts the spending squeeze on Whitehall. But he will splash the Budget cash on ""levelling up"" Britain and increase NHS spending by more than £10billion on Wednesday. Allies warn of a ""technical"" Budget with few surprises — with one Downing Street source branding it ""more plain porridge than full English"". While hiking spending on roads and railways outside the South East, the Spending Review that sets departmental funding for three years will be a post-pandemic ""reality check"". The Chancellor will hammer home his message that the ""coffers need shoring up"" after Covid spending. MPs suspect he will seek to spend again and cut taxes in 2023 — ahead of the next General Election. One source said the review is ""a tale of two halves, with big bungs for big departments to pay for schools, hospitals, roads and more — delivering on our promise to level up — but also a reality check for Whitehall that the free lunches are over"". The Sun understands one winner will be Michael Gove who has pushed for an extra £30billion over three years for his new super-department in charge of levelling up Britain. Last night the Treasury unveiled the first lot of cash, with £6billion earmarked to improve travel to the North and Midlands. About £5.7billion will go on train and station upgrades and the expansion of tram networks in cities outside of London. And £1.2billion will transform bus services, speed up journey times, simplify fares and increase the number of services outside the capital. Manchester will get £1.07billion, Yorkshire £1.3billion, West Midlands £1.05billion and Liverpool City Region £710million. Last night Mr Sunak said: ""There is no reason why somebody working in the North and Midlands should have to wait several times longer for their bus or train in the morning compared to a commuter in the capital."""
64,64,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Michael Gove ‘walks out’ of Tory fundraiser amid property developer ‘cash for access’ row,"THE Conservatives were hit by a fresh sleaze row tonight over claims party chiefs offered dinner with the Housing Secretary to property developers for £4,000. In a furious behind the scenes dust up, The Sun can reveal Michael Gove ""point blank refused"" to be sat with any builders and later walked out of the lavish fundraising bash early. Tory HQ had advertised the 4 October party conference dinner with an offer for paying customers ""to place a preference of senior minister to host your table"" of 10 guests. But The Sun and Sky News have been told a number of Cabinet ministers were angered that the £400-a-head dinner attempted to seat them near paying punters with interests directly involving their ministerial briefs. A senior minister said: ""Nobody really wants to do these dinners because there is always a risk of conflict of interest but this one was a joke."" It was claimed requests for Mr Gove to dine with property firm executives sparked a furious backlash from the Cabinet big beast who sources say ""point blank refused to come"" if he was sat with any of them. Tonight a CCHQ spokesman insisted: ""At no stage in the preparation for this event did CCHQ plan to sit Mr Gove with any property developers. Any claims to the contrary are entirely false."" A spokesman for Mr Gove declined to comment. But eyewitnesses say the top Tory left the event after an hour ""with a face like thunder"". A senior Tory said: ""Michael was trying to be whiter than white on this stuff  and as he's in charge of billions of potential developments, he had made clear he would not sit with developers and left after an hour."" They branded the event ""a farce"" and said the party's fundraising operation ""needed a total reality check."" The senior insider pointed the finger of blame at party co-chairman Ben Elliott who is in charge of raising party funds, but has been at the centre of a number of fundraising rows in recent months. The source said: ""They really don't help themselves with situations like this. Ben Elliott needs to answer for this stuff."" Mr Gove's predecessor Robert Jenrick was marred by a major sleaze affair after sitting next to billionaire developer and discussing a big housing project. But Labour said the Conservatives had clearly failed to learn their lessons from that scandal. Labour's Steve Reed hit out: ""Despite the outrage caused by the former Housing Secretary doing favours for a wealthy developer donor, Ben Elliot and his Conservative colleagues clearly think control of the planning system can be sold to the highest bidder."" The Tories hit back: ""It will not come as news that the Conservative Party, like all major political parties, holds a business event at its annual conference. ""For this event, as with others organised by the party, CCHQ undertook robust due diligence to guard against any conflicts of interest."""
65,65,The Sun,Harry ColeKate Ferguson,Sajid Javid begs Brits to get their Covid booster jabs or face return to masks and WFH,"SAJID Javid begged Brits last night to get their booster vaccinations or face a return to Covid restrictions. The Health Secretary, backing The Sun's Give Britain a Booster campaign, warned it was vital to take up a third jab not just to save lives but to keep our freedoms, too. Another 49,139 cases were confirmed yesterday — with deaths up by a third in a week to 179 — as Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, admitted: ""The numbers are going the wrong way."" Mr Javid spoke directly to people in his Downing Street address, asking them not to blow the success so far in battling the virus — although he ruled out a return to full lockdown. He said: ""We need to sustain the progress that we've made. We could lose it. We really could lose that progress if people don't take up their vaccination offers. ""As a country, we've come such a long way. We've got so much to be proud of — the scientists that designed the vaccines, the NHS, and all the volunteers that delivered the vaccines. ""And look where it has got us, look where we are today versus just not even a year ago, at the start of this year. Look how it has changed our daily lives. And we all want to keep that, we want to sustain that."" A noticeably sombre Mr Javid cautioned that if not enough people got their boosters the Government might have to trigger Plan B, bringing in mandatory masks, vaccine passports and a return to working from home. And he warned that a new mutant Covid was spreading fast in Britain. He added that while there was no evidence it posed a greater threat, the next one might. Some eight million people are eligible for their booster but so far only four million have had shots. Ministers are launching an all-out offensive to drive up this number as they try to avoid a return to the restrictions. The NHS is opening pop-up jabbing clinics and launching an advertising campaign to get people to book their injections. Mr Javid also urged people to mask up on trains, meet outdoors if they can and take lateral flow tests every week. He said: ""With winter soon upon us, these little steps make a big difference."" But he put the country on notice that tougher measures could be on the horizon, saying: ""If we don't do our bit, get vaccinated, all those behavioural changes we can make, we are more likely to face restrictions as we head into winter? ""I think we've been really clear that we've all got a role to play."" And he said if booster rollouts remained sluggish and cases continued to soar ""it would, of course, make it more likely we're going to have more restrictions"". I fully support this campaign from The Sun. As we get close to winter, make sure you get a booster and keep your loved ones safe. He added: ""Now we want to avoid those. We've set out what those restrictions might look like, we've set out the Plan B restrictions, for example. And we all want to avoid those. We can do it, because we've already done it. We've just got to play our part."" Meanwhile, the Government's former vaccine czar Kate Bingham said older people should be ""banging down doors"" to get jabs. MPs yesterday urged Boris Johnson to launch a new drive to put vaccines into arms. They said he should call in troops, open pop-up clinics across the country and enlist a Dad's Army of retired medical staff to carry out the injections. The PM yesterday tweeted: ""I fully support this campaign from The Sun. As we get close to winter, make sure you get a booster and keep your loved ones safe."" Jeremy Hunt, chairman of the health select committee, said: ""There is an urgent need to turbo-charge the booster programme. It is the biggest weapon in our armoury to avoid an NHS meltdown."" MPs are privately furious with the NHS Confederation for swooping on the rise in Covid deaths and hospitalisations to immediately demand a slew of new restrictions. One raged: ""They are trying to bounce us into lockdown."" We need to act with urgency now. Tony Blair, who used to employ NHS Confederation head Matthew Taylor, called for ministers to enact Plan B Covid restrictions. He wants compulsory mask wearing and vaccine passports for mass gatherings, such as concerts and footie matches, adding: ""We need to act with urgency now."" But the PM's spokesman insisted: ""There isn't any proposed plan for any further lockdowns. We're sticking to the plan we have set out."""
66,66,The Sun,Harry Cole,Rishi Sunak under pressure not to hike fuel duty ahead of Budget next week,"RISHI Sunak is under fresh pressure not to hike fuel duty at next week's Budget as petrol prices nudged record highs. The average price for a litre of petrol was 139.46p on Monday - prompting MPs to tell the Chancellor: ""don't even think about a hike next week."" That's the highest petrol has been on the forecourts since March 2013 and less than 3p per litre below the record of 142.17p set in April 2012. Prices have risen by more than 26p per litre in the past 12 months, adding £14 to the cost of filling up a typical 55-litre family car. But last night Government insiders dangled the prospect of a duty hike at next week's Budget. One said: ""Things are looking very tight and cash will be needed down the track to shore up the public coffers. ""Fuel brings in a lot of cash and after more than ten years of freezes, it's an obvious place to go to find a war chest."" But furious Tory MP Craig McKinley hit back: 'Whilst I suspect Treasury Mandarins see motorists as a cash cow to milk further and others an easy squeeze to push more hard-pressed motorists off the road, my advice to the Chancellor would be to hold firm. And Rob Halfon added: ""Motorists and businesses are suffocating from the ever increasing costs on petrol and diesel. ""The Chancellor and Boris need to back white van men and women and keep the fuel duty freeze."" Howard Cox, founder of FairFuel UK added: ""Rishi can show his leadership credentials, with a very welcome and courageous cut in Fuel Duty to compensate for rocketing pump prices."" Treasury declined to comment ahead of next Wednesday's Budget. THE Chancellor could raise duty on spirits for the first time in four years,  producers warn. Distillers fear a rise of as much as five per cent on a bottle."
67,67,The Sun,Harry Cole,British spies to keep ‘close watch’ on China’s new hypersonic nuclear weapon,"BRITISH spies will keep a ""close watch"" on China's new hypersonic nuclear weapon. Beijing stunned the world with the missile test amid fears of a new Cold War. The missile is reported to travel five times faster than the speed of sound, meaning it could potentially hit any target on Earth. The Communist regime, led by President Xi Jinping, has denied testing a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile in August, insisting it was a routine spacecraft check. But a senior government minister told The Sun: ""They would say that, wouldn't they? China always lies."" Boris Johnson's spokesman said: ""We will keep a close watch on this development but it is important that those with these capabilities behave responsibly."" Meanwhile the state's official newspaper Global Times boasted: ""It is inevitable that China will take an upper hand over US military strength."" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said: ""We have made clear our concerns about the military capabilities China continues to pursue."" Sam Ashworth-Hayes, director of research at the Henry Jackson Society think tank, warned that developing hypersonic weapons ""could make people trigger-happy""."
68,68,The Sun,Harry Cole,"Hiking fuel duty in next week’s Budget would be ‘grotesque’ insult to drivers, warn MPs","PUTTING UP Fuel Duty at next week's Budget would be a ""grotesque"" slap in the face for millions of Brits, Rishi Sunak was warned last night. Amid soaring energy bills and the highest forecourt prices in almost a decade, Tory MPs last night urged the Chancellor to back The Sun's ""Keep It Down"" campaign. Powerful Conservative backbencher Robert Halfon told The Sun: ""With the cost of living rising and petrol and diesel prices up nearly 10p over the last few months, putting up fuel duty would be a slap in the face for workers."" ""Rishi should keep the freeze it and show families he is on their side."" Fellow Tory Craig Mackinlay added: ""With the pump price of fuel at an eight year high and other inflationary price rises hitting households this winter it would be grotesque for fuel duty to be raised at the forthcoming Budget and I hope the Chancellor will heed calls for a further freezing of duty."" And the MPs were backed by the FairFuelUK campaigned who warned: ""Hiking fuel tax would be political suicide and economically reckless. Founder Howard Cox urged Mr Sunak to not just freeze Fuel Duty, but cut it to help the pandemic recovery. He said: ""Cutting one of the most punitive motoring levies, in the world and at the same time reducing VAT on our home energy bills is the fiscally sensible way to deliver a booming post Covid economy."" Meanwhile the RAC yesterday demanded the Chancellor slash VAT on fuel. Spokesman Simon Williams said: ""With pump prices now so close to the record high prices of 2012, we think the Government should seriously consider temporarily cutting the level of VAT on motor fuel to help hard-pressed drivers. ""Unlike a reduction in fuel duty, which could just be swallowed up by retailers who are already taking more margin than ever, cutting VAT would benefit drivers immediately as it's charged on the final cost at the pumps."" RAC Fuel Watch says the average price of a litre of petrol has reached 140.22p, the highest level since September 2012 and just 2p off the record high that occurred in April of the same year. Prices have now gone up by nearly 26p a litre in 12 months, from 114.05p on this day last year – a rise of 22 per cent. THE nation overwhelmingly fears Boris Johnson will increase taxes again, a survey found. Nine in ten voters expect the cost of living to rise over the next three years, and are preparing to tighten their belts. Polling of 1,000 Brits by Kekst CNC also found 88 per cent expect more tax hikes This year Mr Johnson broke an election vow by raising National Insurance contributions by 1.5 per cent."
69,69,The Sun,Jonathan ReillyHarry Cole,Spies are at ‘breaking point’ trying to keep tabs on thousands of newly radicalised bedroom fanatics,"BRITAIN'S spies are at ""breaking point"" trying to keep tabs on thousands of newly radicalised bedroom fanatics amid stretched budgets, The Sun can reveal. A high level security source says terror watch lists are currently at record levels of potential lone wolf killers - with MI5 ""saturated"" with new red flags. The top insider added security agencies were the ""busiest they had ever been"" in recent months as Britain unlocked from Covid. Security experts say Britain faces a major threat from the rise in 'Nike' terrorists - nicknamed because they ""just do it"" with little warning and are almost impossible to track. The senior insider chillingly warned: ""There is nothing we can do to stop someone walking into a shop and buying a knife."" The police and security services are also battling a rise in would-be attackers with mental health conditions: with a handful hauled off public transport with knives and machetes in recent months. In the wake of the Manchester bombing in 2017, it was revealed MI5 were conducting 500 active investigations, with another 3,000 ""subjects of interest"" - but more than 20,000 on file. But now those figures are said to have soared this year, and made worse by lockdown. They warned that despite a rise in threats from the far-right, Islamic fundamentalists remain the biggest threat to the nation. Jihadists are the seen to be most ""adept"" at changing the way they operate online to sweep up the most vulnerable young people, who've sat at home in their bedrooms watching their bile spewing videos. It comes as the alleged killer of Southend West MP, Sir David Amess had been referred to anti-terror scheme Prevent, but was never made a ""subject of interest"" by MI5. Dr. Dan Lomas, Lecturer in Intelligence & Security Studies at Brunel University, says: ""What we're seeing is a perfect storm."" ""It really comes at little surprise that budgets and staffing are stretched at a time when the number of potential targets remain the same or increasing. ""Staffing and numbers appear to be increasing, but so are the threats. And they're more varied and difficult to predict than ever. ""Someone who might not seem to pose a risk today, might suddenly decide to carry out an isolated attack with little warning tomorrow. ""In complex plots, including numerous people, it can be easier to pick up chatter that results in arrests. ""But for people who might decide to pick up a sharp object and carry out an attack it's much harder because the chatter is often not there to pick up."" Two years ago then Security minister Ben Wallace warned more investment was needed so spooks could keep an eye on would-be attackers. He warned in 2019: ""I can tell you, we are at stretch. We're not at over-stretch but we're at stretch."" Presciently he added: ""We are going to need to fund more of our intelligence services and our police. Security at home and abroad doesn't come cheap and we are going to have to invest in that and continue."" ""In this game you are also trying to see what's over the horizon. For us to continue to keep pace, we're going to have to grow with it. If we don't invest, then I think we won't keep pace."" Dr Alan Mendoza, executive director of the Henry Jackson Society, warns: ""Despite two decades of jihadist terrorism, we have failed to drain the swamp of the extremist preachers frequently responsible for radicalisation. ""The social media giants have ignored their responsibilities to clamp down on hate speech, but there has also been a lack of will nationally to take on the problem at source by tackling extremism within U. K. communities, and this is reflected in the ever-increasing numbers on this watch list"""
70,70,The Sun,Harry ColeNick Gutteridge,EU scraps most checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland in major Brexit climbdown,"BRUSSELS has agreed to slash four in five checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland in a major Brexit climbdown. EU bosses had insisted for months there was no wriggle room on detailed inspections of all shipments under the terms of 2019's divorce deal. But yesterday, they caved in and pledged to dramatically slash hated paperwork. But, the compromise risked being upended last night by a bizarre intervention from rogue Downing Street aide Dominic Cummings. The ousted Brexit guru claimed Boris Johnson signed the divorce deal knowing he would tear up the aspects around the Irish border. He said ""cheating foreigners is a core part of the job"" of Brexit negotiations, adding: ""Of course there wasn't 'good faith'."" At the moment, a supermarket truck carrying 100 different products from the mainland to Ulster has to file a separate form for each one in case any entered the EU market via Ireland. But, after the PM threatened to pull down the whole Northern Irish Protocol, Brussels has offered to reduce 80 per cent of red tape on fresh food products and half of paperwork for other goods. European Commission Vice-President Maros Šefcovic said he had listened to Northern Ireland, adding the proposals were a, ""direct, genuine response to their concerns""."
71,71,The Sun,Harry Cole,Business Secretary goes cap in hand to Treasury for gas bill bailout that could cost the taxpayer billions,"THE Business Secretary went cap in hand to the Treasury last night for a gas bill bailout that could cost the taxpayer billions. After days of Whitehall bickering, Kwasi Kwarteng presented Chancellor Rishi Sunak with a doom-laden map of British factories that could be forced to close down in weeks due to crippling energy costs. Energy intensive sectors like steel, ceramics, chemicals paper and glass production are all teetering on the edge after having to spend up to two thirds of their production costs on gas bills. The Treasury last night said they were studying the proposals for financial support, that could quickly stretch to hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayer cash in a cold winter. Last night a Business Department source said: ""Without urgent support to help British industry manage high global gas prices, factories will close – many for good - and thousands of jobs will be lost."" The Sun understands a range of interventions have been requested - with the Treasury insisting any support would be given on a case by case basis for individual companies. However targeted support for whole sectors such as glassmaking was not ruled out. Dave Dalton of British Glass told Times Radio last night that up to quarter of the 6,000 jobs employed directly in sector were under risk. A Treasury spokesman said: ""We have now received BEIS's submission and officials are looking through the details. We will do what is in the best interest of both consumers and taxpayers."" But angry Tory MP Steve Baker hit out: ""It'll be an absurdity if free marketeers like Kwasi Kwarteng and Rishi Sunak end up providing bailouts to firms or price cap policies. ""These are the kind of measures consistent with a socialist government and we shouldn't be doing them."" And the Institute of Economic Affairs warned: ""The steel, base chemicals, glass and paper sectors had previously been viewed as a serious long-term investment. ""Now they resemble twitching corpses, destined for one of two fates: another bailout, or nationalisation."" The proposals came after a weekend of bad blood between the two Cabinet ministers. After Mr Kwarteng claimed he was in talks with the Treasury over helping firms, allies of Mr Sunak anonymously accused him of ""making things up on TV."""
72,72,The Sun,Harry Cole,Tone-deaf ministers to announce plans to hike gas bills by £159 despite soaring energy costs,"TONE-DEAF ministers will next week announce plans to hike gas bills by £159, The Sun can reveal. Despite soaring energy costs and factories preparing to shutter this winter, Boris Johnson will double down on his controversial Net Zero Strategy ahead of next month's COP26 climate summit. And central to it will be the controversial Heating and Boiler strategy that will seek to make electricity cheaper and gas more expensive over the next 15 years. It will: The PM will argue that electricity - which is the cleanest it has ever been - is kept artificially expensive, hitting efforts to get people to switch to electric cars and central heating. But insiders say it will take years of listening exercises and legislation before the green levies currently slapped on electricity can be moved over to gas bills. The average green surcharge paid on household electricity bills is £159, with the money used to invest in renewable power generation and subsidise the poorest households' bills. Gas, although currently soaring in price, is taxed at a significantly lower rate despite being far more polluting. A Whitehall source said: ""As we move to a world where we use more electricity to heat our homes and charge our cars, we need to address the artificially high price of electricity."" They warn: ""Over the next decade, households will use more electricity - but pay less for it. And use less gas - but pay more for it."" However Mr Johnson faces fierce opposition from backbench Tory MPs over any plan that could see prices rise. However BoJo will argue switching away from gas will also see Britain suffer less from geo-political uncertainty. Yesterday ministers attempted to lay the blame for soaring gas prices squarely at the door of the Kremlin. Treasury Minister Lord Agnew said: ""The current squeeze on gas prices is nothing to do with the quantity of gas available. It is a geopolitical move by Russia to put pressure on Europe and we are caught up in that."""
73,73,The Sun,Jonathan ReillyHarry Cole,Russian spies ‘stole formula for Oxford/Astra Zeneca Covid jab and used it to create Sputnik vaccine’,"RUSSIA stole the formula for the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab and used it to help create its own vaccine, ministers have been told. Security services say they have proof one of Vladimir Putin's spies swiped the vital data. They say they have proof that vital data was pinched from the drugs firm — including the blueprint for the Covid jab. Russia's Sputnik jab uses similar technology to the Oxford designed vaccine. Security teams are now sure it was copied. It is understood the data was stolen by a foreign agent in person. Last year spies pointed the finger at President Vladimir Putin. They said they were ""more than 95 per cent"" sure Russian state-sponsored hackers had targeted UK, US and Canadian bodies developing a Covid vaccine. The late security minister James Brokenshire said at the time: ""We are very careful in terms of calling these things out, ensuring we can have that confidence in attribution. We believe we have this here."" Tory MP Bob Seely, an expert in Russian affairs, said: ""I think we need to get serious about Russian and Chinese espionage. ""Whether it is stealing the design for Astra- Zeneca or blackmailing us over energy by these authoritarian and totalitarian regimes, we need to get wise to them."" Home office minister Damian Hinds said today: ""We live in world where there's state activity seeking to engage in industrial espionage and economic espionage. ""We face threats of this type that are different, they are more sophisticated, they are more extensive than they ever have been before. ""Constantly there are foreign states who would like to get their hands on sensitive information including sometimes commercial secrets."" Downing Street declined to comment. Andrew Leach, of London PR firm Hudson Sandler, today issued a statement on behalf of the Russian Direct Investment Fund which was established by the Russian state government. He said: ""U. K. media reports that Russia's Sputnik V was allegedly based on research from the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is another fake news and blatant lie based on anonymous sources."""

New forces boss Admiral Sir Tony Radakin ordered Major General Matt Holmes to respect his ""authority"" and stop talking to colleagues and allies about controversial reforms to the Navy. Major General Holmes, the top commander of the Royal Marines, was found dead in his home on Saturday, after losing his dream job and splitting from his wife Lea, of 19 years. Friends of the decorated war hero said he felt ""beaten down, not listened to, merely run over by someone with no military judgement"". He had clashed with Adm Radakin, who was the then First Sea Lord, over plans to reform the Royal Marines. Sir Tony was yesterday appointed Chief of the Defence Staff by Boris Johnson - the most senior role in the Armed Forces. But now furious colleagues have leaked a slew of emails that reveal the fraught relationship he had with the late head of the Royal Marines. Gen Holmes was removed from his dream job as Commandant General just 20 months in to a three-year post after a ""serious falling out"" with Adm Radakin. He successfully fought off plans to give Royal Marines sailors' ranks but lost a battle to give his job to a more senior officer. A terse email exchange seen by The Sun reveals Major General Holmes was admonished by the then First Sea Lord for speaking out against the changes. In the stinging rebuke Adm Radakin ordered him to respect his ""authority"" and to stop speaking to his counterparts in the US Marines and even to ministers. Adm Radkin wrote that he was ""sensitive"" about any information about the planned reforms getting out, adding: ""This is about my authority."" And he said other officers had no right to ""opine"" and ""the debate around this is to be toned down and ideally stopped"". And then he directly ordered: ""International engagement or engagement with retired officers Royal Marines by CGRM on this top is to stop."" The order was later followed up by a subordinate who demanded Gen Holmes formally recognise the demand. That email read: ""First Sea Lord is very clear that he alone has the authority to lead on all subsequent engagements on this sensitive issue - including with ministers, international partners, senior retired officers and senior serving officers."" A Naval Spokesperson said: ""Our condolences, prayers and deepest sympathy are with Matt's family. Their loss is the greatest and most painful: the entire naval service will be there for them now and always."" They added: ""We always have and always will place huge value on the distinct and world-renowned regimental ethos of the Royal Marines within the Royal Navy and wider UK Defence."" A source said Adm Radakin was planning to attend the funeral in Winchester, next week."
75,75,The Sun,Harry Cole,"Brits face biggest council tax hike in two decades next year, bombshell leak shows","HOUSEHOLDS face the biggest council tax rise in two decades next year, warns a bombshell leak from the Tory-run Local Government Association. Town hall levies will have to go up by nine per cent next year — the highest rise since 2003. The memo to ministers also warns of four per cent rises every year until 2025 as costs from elderly social care bites. It would mean the average Band D property paying £340 a year extra — over £2,220 — by 2025. The LGA warns councils will still need more from central government to keep services going. Commenting on the hike, Labour's shadow communities boss Steve Reed said: ""The Government's social care plan doesn't provide any money for social care, but we now know it will lead to massive council tax hikes next spring. ""Yet again, people will find they're paying more but getting less under the Conservatives. ""Working people are already being hit by the conservative cost of living crisis, cuts to universal credit and NI tax hikes and now face a huge council tax increase."""
76,76,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha Clark,Boris Johnson to blast David Cameron and Theresa May for ‘lacking the guts’ to fix Britain,"BORIS Johnson will today blast his predecessors — saying recent Conservative Prime Ministers lacked the ""guts"" to fix Britain and spent years ""dithering"". The dig at Theresa May and David Cameron will feature in his big party conference speech in which he will drive home his ""levelling-up"" message. He has used the three-day gathering of the party faithful to ram home his call for workers to get a pay rise from firms that have spent decades ""drunk on cheap labour"" thanks to unfettered EU migration. The PM will attempt to reset 11 years of Tory rule, saying he will lead a ""change of direction that has been long overdue in the UK to create a high-wage, high-skill, high-productivity economy"". His reforming agenda will include a pledge to fix the massive issues around low pay, social care and the effects of Covid. Mr Johnson will tell Tory members in Manchester: ""After decades of drift and dither, this reforming government, this can-do government that got Brexit done, is getting the vaccine roll-out done and is going to get social care done. ""We are dealing with the biggest underlying issues of our economy and society. The problems that no government has had the guts to tackle before."" And the PM will spell out his mission to level-up Britain with a promise to deliver ""hope and opportunity"" to millions of left- behind Brexit-backing Brits. He will call levelling-up the ""greatest project any government can embark on"" and vow to leave no stone unturned to deal with the ""biggest underlying issues of our economy and society"". He will describe it as ""our mission to promote opportunity with every tool we have"" and to boost talent, genius, flair and enthusiasm evenly across the four nations of the UK. Mr Johnson, who was spotted riding a bicycle in the convention centre yesterday, will tell loyal supporters: ""There is no reason why the inhabitants of one part of the country should be geographically fated to be poorer than others. ""Or why people should feel they have to move away from their loved ones or communities to reach their potential. ""Levelling-up works for the whole country — and is the right and responsible policy."" Today's speech comes after the PM spent the second half of the conference hitting back at his critics. We are dealing with the biggest underlying issues of our economy and society. The problems that no government has had the guts to tackle before. He rejected pleas to keep the £20 Universal Credit uplift — saying taxpayers should not have to stump up the eye-watering £6billion a year bill to keep it going. As millions of people see their benefits cut from today, the PM insisted: ""What we won't do is take more money in tax to subsidise low pay through the welfare system."" Mr Johnson defended the £20-a-week cut as part of his plan to ""do the difficult, long-term things"". ""This country is at a turning point and we can't go on,"" he vowed. And he urged bosses to pay workers more, making the case for a ""high wage, high-skill"" economy that could be ""much, much better"". Meanwhile, Justice Secretary Dominic Raab repeated the claim that Britain had become ""drunk on cheap labour"" under EU freedom of movement rules. And Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the Tories would ""always be the party of freeing things up, not locking things down"" as he pledged a radical shake-up of the NHS to catch up after the pandemic. He told the conference yesterday: ""2022 will be a year of renewal and reform. At a time like this, business as usual cannot be good enough."" It came as petrol and diesel prices reached an eight-year high yesterday. Grilled on whether the nation was in crisis, Mr Johnson said: ""No, I think that, on the contrary, what you're seeing with the UK economy, and indeed the global economy, is very largely — in the supply chains — the stresses and strains that you'd expect from a giant waking up, and that's what's happening."" QUOTE OF THE DAY BREXIT guru Lord Frost said Foreign Office negotiators are ""too nice"" and ""just want to be liked"".

77,77,The Sun,Harry Cole,France swiped almost 5million Covid vaccine doses from Britain in shocking post-Brexit tantrum,"FRANCE swiped almost five million vaccine doses from Britain in a shocking post-Brexit tantrum. President Emmanuel Macron plotted with Brussels chiefs like a modern Napoleon Bonaparte as Britain's Covid jabs rollout humiliated the EU earlier this year. A massive batch of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine expected to arrive in the UK was instead diverted from Holland. The PM then successfully focused on keeping Pfizer jabs flowing. Tories last night said France's actions could have cost lives. In a post-Brexit strop they also threatened to stop the Pfizer vaccine being sent from Europe to the UK — despite our most vulnerable and elderly people desperately needing it for second jabs. However, Boris Johnson successfully focused on keeping the Pfizer flowing because it was so crucial to maintaining our rollout success. Raging ministers believe France's actions could easily have cost lives in the UK. They also compared their menacing threat to that of a ""hostile state"" rather than ""the behaviour of a close ally"". UK relations with France and Brussels hit rock-bottom in the spring — when Britain's vaccine rollout tore ahead of the EU's. On March 22, industry chiefs stated that a vaccine batch — enough to bottle several million doses — was expected to arrive in Britain imminently from its Halix site in Holland. But it never turned up — instead getting diverted to the EU's stuttering rollout scheme, sparking blazing rows between the Prime Minister and Mr Macron. Amid a bitter diplomatic spat, the EU blocked its transfer to the UK, making it clear it would never be granted a licence for export. This is despite the fact that France and other EU countries were sniping at the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab's effectiveness — and refusing to say if it was safe to give to the entire population. At the time an EU diplomat said: ""AstraZeneca has made promises to both the UK and the EU that it cannot fulfil. So there will need to be some sort of deal. ""But it's worth remembering that these Halix doses are in the EU, and AstraZeneca needs permission to ship any of them to the UK, so the cards are stacked against the UK."" It is also claimed France made a veiled threat to Mr Johnson that they would cut off supplies of Pfizer made on the continent, which would have destroyed Britain's jabs rollout. Senior government figures have compared the behaviour as ""akin to an act of war"", and blasted Mr Macron for acting like a mini Napoleon. One government source told The Sun: ""The French stole our vaccines at the same time as they were slagging them off in public and suggesting they weren't safe to use. WHAT a shabby, spiteful little trickster France's pipsqueak President proved to be. Macron acted like a clown over Brexit, insulting Britain for votes back home. That was the least of it. We now know he rubbished our AstraZeneca jab — doing untold, utterly unjustified and deadly harm to its global reputation — while blackmailing us out of five million doses we'd bought. He even refused to rule out cutting our Pfizer supply, despite it being needed in the spring to give second jabs to our must vulnerable and elderly people. The PM focused on keeping the Pfizer flowing — and thankfully succeeded. Yesterday a Macron aide threatened to cut the Channel Islands' power in a tantrum over fish. Macron withdrew his US and Australian ambassadors over the AUKUS submarines deal. No wonder the Aussies picked more reliable allies. Much more of Macron and France will gain pariah status. ""It was an outrageous thing to do and not the action of an ally, which was made very clear to them. ""Withholding vaccines by stopping them leaving the EU had the potential to cost lives with people waiting for both first and second jabs. ""We had a solid vaccine plan in place and this meant we were able to keep on jabbing. But it was an astonishing, outrageous thing to do."" Under the EU's controversial ban, all vaccine makers had to notify national authorities when exporting. Brussels could then step in and block shipments to countries whose rollouts were better than its own. The vaccine spat earlier this year plunged Britain's relations with the EU into crisis less than a month after it had formally left the bloc. EU chiefs launched an all-out assault on Oxford/AstraZeneca, with Mr Macron falsely claiming it did not work in over-65s and branded it ""quasi-ineffective"". EU boss Ursula von der Leyen also accused the UK of cutting corners in its approval of the jab. The result was devastating, with many Europeans shunning the life-saving vaccine amid the bogus safety fears."

Defence sources have claimed that 37-year-old Ben Slater, who was imprisoned by the Taliban last month has been let go and is on a plane back. The ex-soldier was arrested while attempting to help hundreds of Afghans to leave the country. The Sun understands evacuation was done under the direct supervision of the Secretary of State for Defence. Slater who ran his business Nomad Concepts Group in Afghanistan, was trying to evacuate his staff over a land border, reports Sky News. A UK government source said he flew out of Kabul to Doha on the same flight as the Prime Minister's High Representative for Afghan Transition Sir Simon Gass, and Dr Martin Longden Chargé d'Affaires of the UK Mission to Afghanistan. Slater was questioned when a coach carrying members of his staff was stopped at a border. He was planning to cross into a third country after not being able to secure spots for them on the British airlift. He was eventually allowed to cross the border with one assistant but the rest of his staff had to remain in Afghanistan, the Telegraph had reported at the time. It comes amid fears the Taliban may cancel their pledge to allow people to leave Afghanistan. Back in August a statement by the UK government along with the US and more than 90 other countries, confirmed that the Taliban had said anyone who wished to leave the country could do so. The joint statement said: ""We have received assurances from the Taliban that all foreign nationals and any Afghan citizen with travel authorisation from our countries will be allowed to proceed in a safe and orderly manner to points of departure and travel outside the country."""

Major General Matt Holmes, 54, a decorated war hero, had watched his marriage collapse after being sidelined from his ""dream job"" as Commandant General of the Royal Marines. He was removed from the role just 20 months in to a three-year post after clashing with the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin. General Holmes, a dad of two, successfully resisted plans to give Royal Marines sailors' ranks. But he was slapped down by the Navy's top brass for resisting plans to give his job to a ""double-hatted"" senior officer. A source said he had a ""serious falling out"" with the First Sea Lord and his career never recovered. He was transferred to a role in charge of MoD equipment and was due to retire this month. His estranged wife Lea, of 19 years, paid tribute last night to a ""kind and generous"" man who had ""committed his life to serving in the Royal Marines"". In a veiled nod to his problems at work she said: ""He was selfless to such an extent that this was more important than his own career progression."" His sister Sarah said: ""My family's world has been rocked this weekend by the tragic loss of my brother. ""Matt dedicated his life to the service of Queen, country and Corps. ""Last Friday evening he told me he was in fighting form, despite multiple stresses. Just a short time later he took his own life."" Boris Johnson said he was ""very saddened"" by news of his death. ""My thoughts are with Matt's family and friends at this difficult time,"" he wrote. The defence secretary Ben Wallace said Gen Holmes ""embodied the spirit of our Armed Forces, serving with distinction and rigour for over 30 years"". He added: ""I shall always be grateful for Matt's assistance in leading the Marines through the reforms of the Future Commando Force."" EVERY 90 minutes in the UK a life is lost to suicide. It doesn't discriminate, touching the lives of people in every corner of society - from the homeless and unemployed to builders and doctors, reality stars and footballers. It's the biggest killer of people under the age of 35, more deadly than cancer and car crashes. And men are three times more likely to take their own life than women. Yet it's rarely spoken of, a taboo that threatens to continue its deadly rampage unless we all stop and take notice, now. That is why The Sun launched the You're Not Alone campaign. The aim is that by sharing practical advice, raising awareness and breaking down the barriers people face when talking about their mental health, we can all do our bit to help save lives. Let's all vow to ask for help when we need it, and listen out for others... You're Not Alone. If you, or anyone you know, needs help dealing with mental health problems, the following organisations provide support: His successor in the Marines, Lt Gen Rob Magowan, said: ""It matters not that he was a General, but it does that he is a Royal Marine.

80,80,The Sun,Harry ColeJack Elsom,Rishi Sunak vows to fill financial black hole – but he won’t cut taxes for now,"RISHI Sunak cut up the nation's credit card yesterday — as he insisted that slashing taxes now would be ""immoral"". In his first conference speech, he told the Tory faithful he would ""do whatever it takes"" to fix the pandemic black hole in the public finances. But the Chancellor warned borrowing more to spend or slash taxes was not just ""economically irresponsible — it is immoral"". While he attacked Labour directly, some saw his comments as a coded message to boss Boris Johnson that the Treasury would not fund any more big splurges without more money coming into the coffers. But in a rally cry to the true blue activists, Mr Sunak vowed to start cutting levies as soon as the economy is on the road to recovery. He told a packed room of rank-and-file members at the Manchester conference: ""I want to cut taxes, but in order to do that our public finances must be put back on a sustainable footing."" And he hit back at accusations ministers had abandoned Conservative principles by hiking taxes to fund huge spending on the NHS and furlough. Taking aim at Labour, he said: ""Whilst I know tax rises are unpopular — some will even say un-Conservative — I'll tell you what is un-Conservative: unfunded pledges, reckless borrowing and soaring debt."" Bringing down the house with a firm commitment to traditional Tory values, Mr Sunak added: ""I believe in fiscal responsibility. Just borrowing more money and stacking up bills for future generations to pay is not just economically irresponsible — it is immoral. ""Because it's not the state's money — it's your money."" Setting out the scale of the nation's financial woes, the Chancellor reminded Brits that the national debt is sky high. ""Our recovery comes with a cost,"" he said. ""Our national debt is almost 100 per cent of GDP. So we need to fix our public finances."" Just borrowing more money and stacking up bills for future generations to pay is not just economically irresponsible — it is immoral. But offering a vision of hope, he heaped praise on Brexit and said he was ""proud"" to have been a champion of Leave. He added: ""And that's because, despite the challenges in the long term, I believed the agility, flexibility and freedom provided by Brexit would be more valuable in a 21st century global economy than just proximity to a market."" The Instagram-loving Mr Sunak also suggested Brexit Britain could learn lessons from Silicon Valley techies, saying: ""The years I spent in California left a lasting mark on me: working with some of the most innovative and exciting people in finance and technology. ""Watching ideas becoming a reality, seeing entrepreneurs build new teams. ""It's not just about money. I saw a culture, a mindset which was unafraid to challenge itself, reward hard work and was open to all those with the talent to achieve."" But he admitted: ""Right now, we are facing challenges to supply chains, not just here but right around the world and we are determined to tackle them head on."" Mr Sunak added that ""tackling the cost of living isn't just a political soundbite, it's one of the central missions of this Conservative Government"". Later, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps spoke about the shortage of HGV drivers and said there has been a massive rise in people trying to learn to drive lorries. He added: ""Salaries have gone up. I think that's a really good thing. There are now jobs available on decent salaries, that means that more people are coming into the sector. ""And I'm pleased to report there has been a 300 per cent increase in the number of people applying for provisional licences."" He also said applications for provisional licences are now being turned around in five days. QUOTE OF THE DAY LABOUR firebrand Andy Burnham — Mayor of Greater Manchester and so-called King of the North — said: ""In the North, the car is the king, not me, because we are so car-dependent."" JOKE OF THE DAY MICHAEL Gove who was recently filmed dancing in Aberdeen, said: ""This reminds me of my last night on the town. Dance like nobody's watching they say. Well I did. But they were watching."" HERO OF THE DAY EDUCATION Secretary Nadhim Zahawi told how he went from being an Iraqi refugee moving to the UK aged 11 without a word of English, to bagging a seat in Cabinet thanks to the dedication of his teachers.

81,81,The Sun,Harry Cole,Army drivers hit the roads to deliver petrol to Britain’s forecourts after fuel crisis drained stations,"ARMY drivers have started delivering fuel today to Britain's forecourts - as Boris Johnson warns disruption could last until Christmas. Troops have hit the roads for the first time as part of Operation Escalin although long queues for petrol were spotted forming this morning. The PM said it was simply a precaution and there were signs the crisis was abating. But industry chiefs still warned that London and the South East was still badly hit, with more than one in five stations out of petrol and diesel. Mr Johnson again rejected calls for more European tanker driver visas while more Brits are trained to replace cheap labour after Brexit. He insisted: ""The way forward for our country is not to just pull the big lever marked 'uncontrolled immigration' and allow in huge numbers of people."" But he warned of empty shelves in the run-up to Christmas with the economy in a period of transition. He was pressed in a BBC interview about a warning by Chancellor Rishi Sunak that problems in the global supply chain meant shortages could hit the festive season. He replied: ""Rishi is invariably right in everything he says,"" before adding hurriedly: ""It depends how you interpret what he is saying."" Asked about a warning in June by the Road Haulage Association that a major crisis was building due to the shortage of drivers, he insisted he had known about the problems long before then. The Government has agreed to grant 5,000 temporary visas to lorry drivers and a further 5,000 to poultry workers to try to address shortages in those industries. Army personnel were seen in combat fatigues at a storage depot in Hemel Hempstead as they filled up tankers ahead of setting off around the country. Around 200 members of The Army, who were put on standby last week, will initially focus on the hardest-hit areas. They include members of 3rd Logistic Support Regiment who have been in training with the petroleum industry logistics company Hoyers in Thurrock, Essex."
82,82,The Sun,Harry ColeKate Ferguson,Boris Johnson demands firms give Brits a decent pay rise – but says he could hike taxes AGAIN,"BIG-hitter Boris Johnson yesterday demanded bosses give workers a decent pay rise — but could raise taxes again to deal with the Covid pandemic. Warning that disruption on forecourts and in shops was a price to pay to wean the country off cheap labour, the PM vowed to stick to his Brexit pledge to end mass-migration undercutting British workers. He launched a blistering attack on big businesses addicted to broken profit models relying on low pay and imported workers. He said there would be a period of adjustment but added: ""That is what I think we need to see."" And he warned company bosses that ""people need to be decently paid"" and it fell to business to invest more — making jobs more attractive to Brits. Some ministers even think Mr Johnson will lead from the front and could make a pledge to raise the minimum wage to as much as £10 an hour as part of his big conference speech this week. But there could yet be a sting in the tail as he repeatedly left the door open to further tax rises before the next election — expected as soon as 2023. Launching the Conservative Party's conference in Manchester, the PM insisted on BBC TV's Andrew Marr show: ""You have no fiercer and more zealous opponent of unnecessary tax rises than me. But we have had to deal with a pandemic on a scale which this country has not seen before in our lifetimes and long before."" He added: ""If I can possibly avoid it, I do not want to raise taxes again, of course not, nor does Rishi Sunak (the Chancellor)."" But his comments did little to soothe Tory jitters, with Cabinet ministers and powerful MPs queuing up to warn the Government against any further rises after next April's National Insurance raid. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss fired off a barely veiled warning to the PM not to increase taxes any further as she spoke from the fringes of the conference. The Tory darling urged her boss to slash red tape rather than clobber struggling families. She told delegates: ""The way we're going to do that is by growing the economy."" She said the best way of increasing tax revenues was by turbo- charging growth rather than ordering new levies. Ms Truss added: ""There's too much bureaucracy in Britain and we need to use this opportunity of an unfrozen moment, a fresh start to really do things differently. That's the way to get more money into the Exchequer to pay for Covid in my view."" Leader of the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said: ""We must always be looking to ensure the money spent by the state is spent efficiently and the tax burden is reasonable and we are at the upper reaches of that reasonableness."" It came as the PM faced a growing Tory revolt over plans to slash £20 a week from Universal Credit. West Midlands Mayor Andy Street said he was concerned by the cuts. There's too much bureaucracy in Britain and we need to use this opportunity of an unfrozen moment, a fresh start to really do things differently. He added: ""The team here have been looking at what the Government could do to mitigate this. Are they going to make these cuts across the board for everybody, to the same extent? Because actually, the £20 uplift was much more significant for singles under 25 than it was for joint claimants over 25, for example."" He suggested housing benefit could be whacked up to lessen the effects on younger people. Meanwhile, the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland ganged up to demand an urgent rethink. Nicola Sturgeon, Mark Drakeford and Paul Givan all wrote to the PM pleading with him to intervene. They warned: ""Your Government is withdrawing this lifeline just as the country is facing a significant cost-of-living crisis."" Mr Johnson showed his fighting spirit yesterday on a visit to Manchester's HideOut Youth Zone. He wore blue boxing gloves bearing the slogan ""Build Back Better"" and took some swings at a punchbag. The PM hopes to use this week's gathering to land a knockout blow on Labour rival Sir Keir Starmer. Mr Johnson had seemed hot under the collar after wearing a white work shirt for his morning jog before the conference. The panting PM braved chilly conditions in his long-sleeves and trademark Team GB shorts. After catching his breath, the PM later appeared for interview in a similar shirt, although it is understood it was a clean one."
83,83,The Sun,Harry Cole,Michael Gove says the next James Bond should be a MAN and picks an unlikely actor to take over as 007,"MICHAEL GOVE has said the next James Bond should be a man and has picked an unlikely actor to take over as 007. The new Levelling Up Secretary of State says Line Of Duty star Stephen Graham, 48, should replace outgoing Daniel Craig, 53. He told The Sun: ""We don't need a female Bond, it's time for a scouse Bond, though."" Meanwhile, Mr Gove let rip at Sir Keir Starmer's suggestion it is time for a female Bond, saying: ""James Bond's a man."" In a blistering assault on the Labour leader, the former Education Secretary branded him a bore. And he slammed Sir Keir's 90-minute conference speech as: ""One of the most empty orations I've ever heard. Never mind cars running on empty, the Labour Party is running on empty if that's all he's got to say. ""The idea he's changed Labour just because Jeremy Corbyn looks a bit sad is for the birds."" And Prime Minister Boris Johnson appears to agree with Gove on the subject of 007's gender. He told The Times: ""I think it will be up to whoever the next James Bond is to identify him or herself. ""I think it's gotta be a man frankly. That's my view."" It comes as Daniel Craig said Jurgen Klopp could be the next  James Bond. But Liverpool boss Klopp laughed at the suggestion, saying: ""I would be a very bad James Bond. If I walked out of the water in swim shorts, the whole of the world would turn off. ""It's a great story, I will watch it always. He has to save the world and I have to help Liverpool. ""I was lucky enough to meet Daniel Craig a few times and I will miss him as James Bond. ""I am happy watching him and seeing him do what he does. I actually will miss him as James Bond, to be honest."""
84,84,The Sun,Harry Cole,Michael Gove finally admits he ‘made a mistake’ when he stabbed Boris Johnson in back during 2016 leadership bid,"MICHAEL Gove has finally admitted he was wrong to blow up Boris Johnson's leadership campaign in 2016, saying he bitterly regrets it. He claims he has told the Prime Minister he is sorry for stabbing him in the back and added: ""Everybody knows I made a mistake then."" And by giving him a job in the Cabinet, Michael Gove said that he feels the pair have wholeheartedly made up after the intrigue five years ago. He said BoJo appears to have buried the hatchet, gushing: ""As well as being a great Prime Minister, Boris is also instinctively generous-hearted. ""He has been nothing but a great boss."" In 2016, Gove fired a rocket at his former Brexit buddy on the day Boris launched his doomed tilt at No10 – saying he lacked the leadership skills to run the country or build a team. In shock at the betrayal, Boris dropped out of the race, leaving a path to power for Theresa May. But five years later, Gove tells The Sun that he got it wrong and he regrets it every day. Asked how they had made up, Gove says: ""Well, he is the PM and he still got me in a job."" And he pointed to the team that Boris has built as a true mark of how badly he got it wrong to not back him before. He said: ""We have the most diverse Cabinet of any country in the world – a British Asian Chancellor, a British Asian Home Secretary, a British Asian Health Secretary, a British Ghanaian Business Secretary. ""If you think about the backgrounds that people have come from, then these  are amazing stories of success."""
85,85,The Sun,Harry Cole,"Tories risk betraying Brexit voters if they fail to ‘Level Up’ Britain, warns Michael Gove","BORIS Johnson's pledge to ""Level Up"" Britain is ""do or die"" for the Tories, Michael Gove has warned. Mr Gove said the party risks betraying Brexit voters if it fails. The new Whitehall super-department boss uses his first interview today to unveil his ""stay local but go far"" promise — vowing no one will have to move to the South to be a success. The Levelling Up Secretary tells The Sun that nobody should have to ""leave the place you love in order to live the life you want"". He sets out his four-pronged assault on regional inequality in Britain. He says a pay rise for the labouring ""backbone of Britain"" is at the centre of the agenda, alongside lower crime rates as well as better schools and hospital services by 2024. All of that must come with a restoration of community pride — starting with Britain's worn down high streets and town centres. He said: ""The first part of it is making sure that someone can see a visible difference in somewhere being made more attractive, and knows it's the focus of attention. ""And then the second thing is laying the groundwork for your long-term economic transformation."" And voters will be able to judge if the Government has recovered from the pandemic while hitting those goals. But if they cannot ""feel"" the difference between now and the next election the spirit of Brexit — and the promises of Vote Leave — will have been betrayed. Mr Gove added: ""Boris and I back Brexit. We believe in it. But we also know that there's an obligation to show that it's working."""
86,86,The Sun,Harry Cole,"Council tax bills will rocket by £500 a year to fill £8billion black hole in social care, Town Hall chiefs warn","COUNCIL tax bills will need to rocket by nearly £500 a year to fill an £8 billion blackhole in social care, Town Hall chiefs warn today. The Local Government Association warns that even hiking bills by 25 per cent will not meet the shortfall in care provision over the next three years. But that would see the average Band D home see their annual bill soar by £475 to more than £2,370 by 2024. The Tory-led group of local government bigwigs say just providing the same level of services now mean they need at least £8 billion more in the budgets due to rising costs pressures. Without extra cash they warn ""care for older and disabled people, child protection, homelessness prevention, waste and recycling, and road maintenance"" will all suffer. With widespread bankruptcies of local service providers predicted by 2024, pressure is mounting on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to use next year's National Insurance raid to to pay for social care sooner. Currently the lion's share of the new Health and Social Care Levy will be used to pay for the massive pandemic backlog in the NHS. The majority of the 12 billion the tax hike will raise is not due to be used for social care until at least 2024. But the LGA say that is too little too late and makes a mockery of the PM's commitment to ""level up"" the country. They warn without a massive funding hike for town halls at next month's Spending Review, councils will be left with no choice but to punish residents wallets. Cllr James Jamieson, LGA Chairman, said: ""Councils continue to face severe funding and demand pressures that will stretch the local services our communities rely on to the limit. ""If we are to come out of this pandemic with a society that is truly levelled up, the vital services that councils provide must be at the heart of it. ""Councils need certainty over their medium-term finances, adequate funding to tackle day-to-day pressures and long-term investment in people and transforming places across all parts of the country to turn levelling up from a political slogan to a reality that leads to real change for people's lives."" Last night Health Secretary Sajid Javid signed off an extra £388 million to fight Covid in care homes this winter. The bumper sum of cash will be used to pay care staff who need to travel to get booster Covid jabs and flu vaccines during their work hours. It will also fund PPE and regular testing of staff through the winter months. Mr Javid said: ""Protecting care home staff and residents has been a priority throughout the pandemic and as we move into winter I am committed to ensuring they have the resources they need. ""This additional funding demonstrates how we will continue to support those delivering and receiving care. ""Everyone deserves to be cared for with dignity and respect and our wider reforms will continue to work towards our aim of a world-leading social care system."""

Last week The Sun revealed how Leeds United have offered to pay for their flights and train the 32-strong teen team who have fled the Taliban. Now two other major football clubs are set to announce within days they will also help to find places in their youth development teams for the desperate footy stars. And Priti Patel is urgently working on whether UK visas can be found for the girls, their coaches and their families after their plight was raised by charity Football For Peace. They are currently on 30 days temporary permits in Pakistan after escaping over the land border from Kabul as the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan in August. But they may be sent back to face their fate under the women-hating regime if a third country cannot be found for them. Last night a source close to the Home Secretary said: ""Priti is straining every sinew to help get these girls to safety."" And Downing Street confirmed they had received a request to help from Leeds United chairman Andrea Radrizzanic, who has said his club is ready ""to support in anyway we can."" Kashif Siddiqi, a former Pakistani international and founder of Co-founder of Football for Peace, told The Sun: ""It's brilliant that the Home Secretary is now personally involved and that she's doing everything possible to save the girls and their families.

The PM begged Brits to calm down and ""go about their business in the normal way and fill up in the normal way, when you really need it"". He said: ""We want to make sure that we have all the preparations necessary to get through 'til Christmas and beyond, not just in the petrol stations, but all parts of the supply chain."" He blamed the sluggish global economic bounce back from the pandemic for sucking in a ""huge amount of demand"" for gas and deliveries. But he ruled out letting key workers skip the queues, suggesting instead ""the best thing for everybody is that we stabilise it in the normal way"". Government insiders say it would be impossible to police the pumps for key workers. Mr Johnson also warned throwing open Britain's borders to low-paid workers was not how the public would want him to fix the crisis."

It raised fears of a new blockade of Jersey by French militants. Two Royal Navy clippers were sent in to protect the Crown dependency and forced the French trawlermen into peace talks over continued access to UK waters. Now tensions are set to reignite as Britain and Jersey have thrown out three quarters of their demands for licenses to fish our waters. Government insiders warned any French boats planning a similar stunt in the coming days that ""all contingency measures are on the table"" as ministers braced for fresh clashes. In weeks of tense negotiations, Brussels demanded at least 47 new licenses for European boats to fish near to the UK mainland. But the UK gave the green light to just 12 last night - saying most of them didn't meet the new strict, post-Brexit criteria. In the waters around Jersey, 166 boats claimed historical ties to the area, but just 47 licences got fish will be granted today. It's feared the two thirds of rejected boats could blockade Jersey again within days. Boats need to have made at least one fishing trip to the area per year for at least four out of five years between 2012 and 2016. Civil servants were locked in a tense two-hour crunch meeting yesterday with the European Commission and the French to lay out the terms of the new deal. Officials demanded data showing fishing activity in the area and recordings of what fish were caught as proof. Fishermen will find out today whether they've secured one of the much sought-after licences to fish within miles of British coastlines. A UK Government spokesperson insisted their ""approach has been reasonable"" and ""fully in line with our commitments"" made in the Brexit trade deal. They added: ""We continue to work with the Commission and the French authorities and will consider any further evidence provided to support the remaining licence applications."" We will not hesitate to take retaliatory action Last night French sabre rattling was led by their outspoken Europe Minister Clement Beaune - who warned they would ""not hesitate"" at retaliating if they felt short changed on fishing licences. He fumed: ""We understand and share the frustration of our fishermen. ""We cannot cooperate in confidence with the UK until the deal is honoured. We will not hesitate to take retaliatory action."" He said an EU-wide response could include tariffs on British goods or cutting cooperation on energy supplies. ""There are numerous areas in which the Brits need us"", he added. Fishing minister Annick Girardin added: ""French fishing must not be taken hostage by the British for political ends."" French fishermen have threatened to blockade UK goods and rip up electricity cables to Jersey if they don't get full access to our waters. One warned: ""In this game, it will end badly."" The EU Commission welcomed the extra licenses for some French boats but said it ""regrets that it has not been possible to bring this issue now to an end"". A spokeswoman said: ""We will ask the U. K. for full disclosure of their methodology and will continue to further engage in the interest of our fishermen and women so that further licenses will be provided."""

Last night 150 troops were training to drive tankers — hours after a bungling Cabinet minister said there were no shortages or plans to call in the Army. Boris Johnson and his team were accused of being ""asleep at the wheel"" as mile-long queues for fuel developed and fights broke out at petrol stations. BP, Esso and Shell bosses jointly begged panicking drivers to ""only buy fuel as they usually would"". Forecourts should return to normal in ""the coming days"" if people calmed down, they added. But last night the Business Department formally appealed to the Ministry of Defence for support to distribute fuel around Britain. A Military Assistance to Civil Authorities request will see 150 specialist troops retrain to work with highly flammable fuel and remain on standby in the coming days and weeks. Earlier Environment Secretary George Eustice had claimed: ""There have been some shortages of HGV drivers getting petrol to forecourts but actually that is quite limited."" He said: ""We've no plans at the moment to bring in the Army to do the driving."" Labour's Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said ministers were ""asleep at the wheel"" over the crisis. Later, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: ""The men and women of our Armed Forces stand ready to alleviate the transport pressures where they are felt most."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said: ""While the fuel industry expects demand will return to its normal levels in the coming days, it's right we take this sensible, precautionary step.""

Speaking publicly for the first time about his doomed plan, the PM accepted ""the tunnel or bridge is perhaps - although it remains an ambition - it's not the most immediate."" The undersea cross Indra had been widely criticised and mocked - not least by BoJo's ex adviser Dominic Cummings who branded it the ""world's most stupid tunnel."" But work on designs for the 31.5 mile underwater route from Portpatrick in Dumfries & Galloway to Larne in Northern Ireland had been drawn up in Whitehall and given an early green light. Asked about his plans for big infrastructure projects like HS2, Mr Johnson told reporters: ""You'll have to wait until the spending review and the integrated rail plan which is also coming out. ""But it will be wonderful for all parts of the North, the North East, North West, Leeds, Nottingham, Derby, everywhere, Newcastle, Liverpool, Manchester, we have wonderful plans. ""What I would say perhaps about the tunnel or bridge is perhaps although it remains an ambition it's not the most immediate.

93,93,The Sun,Harry Cole,"Doctors MUST return to seeing patients in person to save lives, Boris Johnson says","DOCTORS must start seeing more patients face-to-face to save lives, Boris Johnson warned last night. The Prime Minister said unless GPs swap appointments in surgeries for video call consultations patients will suffer as illnesses and ailments are missed. Speaking in America, Mr Johnson warned: ""People need the security and confidence that they will be treated in person by a GP who can have proper hands-on understanding of the problem they have got. ""That is only reasonable. People are entitled to that reassurance. ""I am absolutely certain that unless we can deliver that there will be people sadly whose symptoms are not picked up and who will suffer as a result."" Asked about a warning from the head of the Royal College of GPs that face-to-face appointments might never return to their normal level, the PM said: ""People should see their GPs in person if that's what they need. ""Some people will be happy with other contact or reassurance but a lot of people will need a face to face appointment and all the reassurance that gives. ""I want to see GPs seeing the right people at the right time and the right place."" The intervention came after the head of the Royal College of GPs said that the current situation - that 57 percent of appointments are taking place in person - was ""about right"" and that the public would ""get used to it"". Prof Martin Marshall told the Commons on Tuesday: ""I'd say we are probably about where we should be – a reduction in face-to-face from 80 per cent to 56 per cent on average across the country is probably about right. ""I suspect patients will get used to remote consultations."" Campaigners and patients' groups have claimed that many vulnerable Brits have been unable to access the appropriate care due to the lack of face-to-face appointments. The British Medical Association said that the claims that GPs were refusing face-to-face appointments were ""inaccurate"" and ""dangerous"". Before the pandemic hit last March, around 80 per cent of all consultations were made at a doctor's surgery - now it is just above half. In May, officials in the health sector promised to scrap the ""total triage"" system that was brought in during the pandemic. This meant patients had to call their GP surgery first to explain their symptoms, then undergo a telephone or video consultation before meeting their doctor in person. Officials said that all patients had the right to choose if they wanted to see their doctor in person."

Promising ""kebabs, the kofta, lamb burgers and fantastic juicy cuts of welsh lamb"" would soon be on US shelves, Boris said the mad-cow disease era ban was ""totally unjustified, discriminating."" However there was little progress made on a wider free-trade accord with the United States, and confusion over Britain's desire to join a North American trade pact between the US, Canada and Mexico. After the idea was discussed by new Foreign Secretary Liz Truss with her US counterpart, No10 insisted that their first goal would be a bilateral agreement with Washington. But Mexico last night said they would be open to discussions about the UK joining their accord ahead of a visit by Ms Truss today. Mr Johnson will land back in London today after his four day tour of New York and Washington. Bullish aides last night also pointed to the ""tangible benefits"" won by the PM in getting the US border reopened for double jabbed Brits from November. Mr Johnson also raised the plight of England's Ashes tour of Australia this autumn at a meeting with Aussie premier Scott Morrisson in a bid to get the Aussie border open to England cricket team as well as their families. He also hailed Joe Biden for putting ""puff in sails"" in unlocking billions of dollars toward green target goals. Last night Mr Johnson took centre stage at the United Nations General Assembly to give a doomladen speech about the death of the planet. Ahead of Britain hosting the landmark COP26 trade summit in November, Mr Johnson said: When Kermit the frog sang ""It's Not Easy Bein' Green"",  want you to know he was wrong. We have the technology: we have the choice before us."" Addressing world leaders, he added: ""I invite you in November to celebrate what I hope will be a coming of age and to blow out the candles of a world on fire. See you in Glasgow."""
95,95,The Sun,Harry Cole,PM told Emmanuel Macron to “get a grip” as he compared his meltdown over defence pact to a jilted lover,"BORIS Johnson told Emmanuel Macron to ""get a grip"" last night as he compared France's meltdown over the new UK, US and Aussie defence to the behaviour of a jilted lover. The PM slammed the door to France or any other country joining the new AUKUS agreement as he announced plans to widen it far beyond nuclear submarine secret sharing. And teasing the hopping mad French premier, BoJo appeared to compare Macron's epic diplomatic temper tantrum to the hurt of a romantic breakup. While Australia swear blind they gave the Paris fair warning that they were tearing up a £50 Billion submarine deal to go with the UK and US instead, Macron says it was a ""stab in the back"" out of the blue. Rejecting claims the French were stitched up or blindsided, Mr Johnson said ""there are no easy ways of having these conversations."" ""It's a very human thing to delay the conversation until the last possible moment...I don't know if anyone has been in that situation in their emotional life, but it's very human to put it off."" Yesterday morning the PM had called for calm despite the French being billions out of pocket. Slipping into Franglais he joked: ""I just think it's time for some of our dearest friends around the world to prenez un grip (get a grip) about this and donnez-moi un break (give me a break). But last night he risked inflaming tensions by saying France would never be able to join the new pact and it would look to widen its depth to sharing intelligence and cyber technology. He said: ""It's about three countries who have shared values and perspectives and such a high degree of trust they are willing to share very important details."" He added ""this is the right team"" to build a bulwark against Chinese aggression in fields like Artificial Intelligence and cyber security. It is understood that the allies believe the French over-reaction is due to their embarrassment at their intelligence and security services failing to spot the deal coming as well as a diplomatic haggle for higher compensation for the abandoned contract. AUKUS saw Sydney tear up a contract with Paris for new diesel-powered submarines, in favour of superior nuclear-powered US and UK boats. The Sun understands Aussie boss Scott Morrison remains adamant he told the French what was coming before the pact was announced last week. Last night Mr Macron agreed to return France's ambassador to the United States after he was recalled in the fallout, following a thirty minute call with Biden."
96,96,The Sun,Harry Cole,Britain could be set to join US’s free-trade deal with Mexico and Canada after hopes of one-on-one deal dashed,"BRITAIN is looking to join the US's free-trade deal with Mexico and Canada as hopes wither of a one-on-one deal. Boris Johnson hoped to kickstart stalling US trade talks during his visit to Joe Biden at the White House last night. Mr Johnson lavished praise on the President, saying he wanted to work with him ""build back better for the world together."" Mr Biden said he would visit Glasgow ""with bells on"" for the COP26 summit, adding he was anxious to attend. But the PM was yesterday unable to say a post-Brexit agreement with Washington could be signed before the next election in 2024 — after admitting the US had other ""fish to fry"". The ball is in the US's court... it takes two to tango The President was gloomy about the prospects of a trade deal when meeting with Boris Johnson in the Oval Office. Asked by The Sun if Britain was still ""back of the queue for a deal"" as threatened by Barack Obama in 2016, Mr Biden said: ""We'll have to work that through"" and added they would ""talk a little about it today."" The lukewarm response came as he warned he felt ""very strongly"" about peace in Northern Ireland and would step into over any threat to a hard border with Ireland from Brexit. The north-American USMCA pact is a Trump-era low tariff and quota agreement and is seen as a ""backdoor"" to a full UK/US bilateral accord. Joining would mark a dramatic shift away from our traditional European ties. It is understood that new Foreign Secretary Liz Truss pitched the idea of the UK joining the USMCA to her US counterpart Antony Blinken at their first meeting on the fringes of this week's UN summit in New York. Last night one insider threw down the gauntlet to President Biden, saying: ""There are a variety of different ways to do this. The question is whether the US administration is ready. ""The ball is in the US's court. It takes two to tango."" Ahead of his meeting with President Biden at the Oval Office last night, No10 said relations with our closest ally were the best they had been in decades. But they risked a row with the leader of the free world after the PM took to American morning television to criticise Biden's handling of the Afghanistan pull-out. Pushed on NBC, Mr Johnson said: ""Could we have done it differently? Maybe we could."" But last night the pair hailed their green progress at the UN, after Mr Biden doubled US funding to help developing countries fight climate change. The PM's $100billion global target now looks certain to be hit. Tomorrow Mr Johnson will warn the UN time is running out to save the planet. He will say: ""We still cling with part of our minds to the infantile belief that the world was made for our gratification and pleasure, and we combine this narcissism with a primitive assumption of our own immortality."""
97,97,The Sun,Harry Cole,PM admits Brits are set to face another uncertain Christmas amid Covid and supply chain chaos,"BRITS face yet another uncertain Christmas amid Covid and supply chain chaos, Boris Johnson has admitted. Asked if things will be back to normal this year, the PM, left yesterday, could only offer hope that ""we certainly don't want or expect to have to do anything like last Christmas"". He added that cancelling festivities ""is very much not the plan"" amid fears of empty shelves and overwhelmed hospitals. Speaking from New York, Mr Johnson compared the economic recovery to ""the big thaw"" after water in pipes had frozen. He said: ""That's when you have the problems and the leaks and difficulties."" But he insisted: ""We're going to fix it."""
98,98,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson brands Covid a ‘bummer’ during meeting with anti-vax Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro,"THE Prime Minister branded Covid a ""bummer"" yesterday as he teased anti-vax Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro. Boris Johnson used their meeting in New York to sing the praises of AstraZeneca, saying: ""It's a great vaccine."" When Bolsonaro — who has claimed jabs can turn people into crocodiles — said he had not received his inoculation ""yet"", Mr Johnson replied: ""I've had it twice."" The pair met at the UN where Mr Johnson also told world leaders commitments to tackle the climate crisis are ""nowhere near enough"". And he said there was a ""vast"" gap between the what the richest nations on the planet had pledged to save it and what they had actually coughed up in hard cash."
99,99,The Sun,Harry Cole,‘Frustrated’ Boris Johnson skewers fellow world leaders for ducking climate change challenges,"BORIS Johnson has let rip at fellow world leaders and accused them of shirking their green duty. In a meeting at the United Nations, the PM said he was ""increasingly frustrated"" that their commitments to tackle the climate crisis are ""nowhere near enough"". And he said there was a ""vast"" gap between what the richest nations on the planet had pledged - and what they had actually coughed up in hard cash. The PM is in New York to crack the whip on a global green deal at the UK-hosted Cop26 in November. But he said there was only a ""six out of ten"" chance he would be able to shake the tin enough to meet his £100billion pledge to help poorer nations make the switch to clean energy. Co-hosting a discussion at the UN General Assembly, the Prime Minister noted that ""everyone nods and we all agree that something must be done"". ""Yet I confess I'm increasingly frustrated that the 'something' to which many of you have committed is nowhere near enough,"" he said. ""It is the biggest economies in the world that are causing the problem, while the smallest suffer the worst consequences. ""And while progress is being made all over the world, the gulf between what has been promised, what is actually being delivered, and what needs to happen... it remains vast. ""Too many major economies - some represented here today, some absent - are lagging too far behind."" Urging counterparts to ""step up"", the PM finished: ""So you can look away, you can do the minimum, you can hope that if you feed the crocodile enough it will devour you last. Or you can show leadership."" Global leaders have already agreed that there is a £100billion price tag to wean the poorest nations off of dirty polluting fossil fuels; but there are fears the money actually pledged by rich nations will full far short of that total. Earlier the PM slammed UK eco-warriors for blockading the M25 motorway - bringing traffic to a standstill and infuriating commuters."
100,100,The Sun,Harry Cole,US travel ban is LIFTED allowing Florida holidays this winter for vaccinated Brits,"HOLIDAYS to America will be open to double- jabbed Brits in weeks. Visits to the likes of Disneyland, Miami and New York could be on from ""early November"" after a surprise announcement by Joe Biden. The US border was shut by Donald Trump in March 2020. Boris Johnson had been lobbying for restrictions to be lifted ahead of a visit with President Biden. He hailed the breakthrough as ""a fantastic boost for business and trade, and great that family and friends on both sides of the pond can be reunited once again"". Travellers will need to demonstrate proof of vaccination before boarding, as well as proof of a negative Covid test taken within three days of their flight. It was not clear if unjabbed kids will be able to travel with vaccinated parents. But officials said they were confident the AstraZeneca jab would be recognised despite it not being rolled out Stateside. The announcement came ahead of talks between Mr Johnson and President Biden at the White House today. In New York last night the PM said: ""We have done it faster than we expected but that's thanks to the hard work of our teams."" He also singled out the success of the UK vaccine rollout as a key driver behind the White House's decision to soften its stance. US travellers have been able to visit Britain since July. A fantastic boost for business and trade, and great that family and friends on both sides of the pond can be reunited once again. Airline shares soared as transatlantic carriers Virgin and BA opened bookings. BA boss Sean Doyle said: ""Today's news marks a historic moment and one which will provide a huge boost to global Britain as it emerges from this pandemic."""
101,101,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson says booster jabs for UK’s elderly must come before sending doses to poorer nations,"BORIS Johnson today insisted booster jabs for Brits must come before shipping vaccines to the world's needy. The PM said evidence of waning immunity means the UK should prioritise its elderly population getting a THIRD dose - despite poorer nations crying out for supplies. Arriving in New York to meet 100 world leaders at the UN General Assembly the PM was tackled on the thorny issue of how to get worldwide jab rates up to the levels of developed nations. But he risks a row with some poorer nations desperate for more vaccines as the over-50s in the UK begin to get their top-up shot. Speaking on board his RAF Voyager on Sunday night, BoJo defended his booster programme saying: ""If you ask me, should we interrupt the booster programme for elderly and vulnerable people in this country, well I've looked at the evidence for what boosters can do. ""I've looked at the extra protection it can give people, and I have to say I think that that has to be our priority and we're going to continue to do that."" But he insisted the UK was leading the way in jabbing the world: ""That doesn't mean we're not making also a massive commitment to the rest of the world, because we fundamentally agree that nobody's safe until everybody is safe."" He added: ""Because of the deal we did with AstraZeneca, I think about a billion vaccines have been distributed around the world at cost to people who might not otherwise have been able to afford them. That was thanks to the UK Government. ""We have also made huge contributions to Covax, to Gavi, to global organisations that are bringing vaccines to people who need them. ""We're doing even more now, we'll do another 100 million by June next year."" Rich nations agreed to fund 100billion doses for poorer countries at the G7 meeting in Cornwall in June. Less than a third of the planet has been full-vaxxed against Covid, with developing nations lacking far behind wealthier counterparts. Barely 1 per cent of people in African nations Nigeria and Ethiopia have been double-jabbed. Thirty-two million over-50s and vulnerable Brits will start receiving booster jabs this autumn to top up their antibodies. They will get a shot of the Pfizer vaccine six months after their second dose."
102,102,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson will tell Joe Biden to lift Covid travel ban and let double jabbed Brits back into US,"BORIS Johnson jetted to New York last night in a bid to restart UK-US travel. There are hopes America will reopen its border to Brits  after the PM meets President Joe Biden at the White House on Tuesday. Mr Johnson will also join more than 100 world leaders at the UN — the last gathering before November's landmark Cop26 summit in Glasgow. He will urge them to step up on climate change in the last 50 days before November's get-together. And he will announce an additional £500million of UK funding to help poorer countries move away from coal. Mr Johnson said he would push the leaders to take ""concrete action on coal, climate, cars and trees"". It is still not known whether Chinese president Xi Jinping will attend Cop26, although a delegation from the globe's most polluting nation will be there. Cop26 President Alok Sharma said: ""I'm hopeful he will come."" It is thought that Mr Johnson will make an ""impassioned"" case to the US President, over why he should lift the travel ban. This could mean that fully vaccinated people in the UK may be able to travel directly into America after Mr Biden's failure to ease restrictions. Both leaders pledged to take action when they met at the G7 summit in June, however nothing has yet been done about the situation. Boris has landed in New York on Sunday to kick start his US visit, which will be four days long. He will also be attending the UN General Assembly before his first White House trip since entering Number 10 in July 2019. It comes after the UK and US signed a defence pact with Australia, including the deployment of defence-powered submarines in the Indo-Pacific. Usually more than four million Brits fly to America in a normal year, but due to the borders being closed during the pandemic only a fraction of those trips are taking place. Under the tight Biden administration rules only US citizens and residents can travel from scores of countries, including the UK, most of Europe and Canada, into America."
103,103,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson tells Emmanuel Macron to chill out after after French lost billions in Aussie subs row,"BORIS Johnson last night told Emmanuel Macron to chill out after the French lost billions in the Aussie subs row. A defiant PM said Britain's relationship with France is ""ineradicable"" despite the raging French branding him a ""lap dog"" to America. BoJo moved to soothe the explosive diplomatic spat after Paris was left massively out of pocket by a new defence pact forged between the UK, US and Australia - dubbed AUKUS. France had been due to sell the Aussies £47 billion worth of diesel powered subs - but the Australian government dramatically ripped up the contract last week in favour of nuclear boats from Britain and America. President Macron threw such a big hissy fit in response that he cut off diplomatic ties with Washington and Canberra, while his ministers went on the onslaught against Britain. But despite their rage, the PM said: ""I don't think anyone needs to worry… particularly not our French friends."" His comments came as Paris government figures queued up to slam the PM for ""stabbing an ally in the back."" French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian - who will have face to face talks with the UK in at the United Nations General Assembly in New York this week - accused BoJo of ""permanent opportunism"". Meanwhile gobby French Europe Minister Clement Beune whined: ""Our British friends explained to us they were leaving the EU to create Global Britain. We can see that this is a return into the American lap and form of accepted vacillation."" But quizzed on his way to the UN in New York, the PM laughed off the barrage of insults. He told The Sun: ""We are very, very proud of our relationship with France and it is of huge importance to this country. ""It is a very friendly relationship - and entente cordial - that goes back a century or more and it absolutely vital for us. And he added: ""Our love of France is ineradicable and what I would say is this AUKUS deal.. it is not meant to be exclusionary, it is not something I don't think anyone needs to worry about and particularly not our French friends."" But the PM could not resist teasing the French, citing their comic book legend Asterix as proof of the bond shared between the two nations. He told reporters on board the RAF Voyager flying to the UN in New York: ""I don't know how many of you know this but there is a UK/France nuclear simulated testing programme we have: we test nuclear explosions together. ""Well we simulate the testing of nuclear explosions together I should add we don't actually blow anything up! ""It's called the Teutates T-E-U-T-A-T-E-S which I think is the Gaulish god of thunder, from my studies of Asterix. But I might be wrong about that - you might want to look that up? ""Anyway, so this is something that goes very, very deep; our love of France, our admiration of France is ineradicable."""
104,104,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson says there is only a 60% chance he will hit climate change goal as he lands in NY to meet world leaders,"BORIS Johnson has admitted there is only a sixty per cent chance he will hit a landmark climate change goal. The PM touched down in New York last night to crack the whip on a global green deal at the UK hosted Cop26 in November. But he said there was only a ""6 out of ten"" chance he would be able to shake the tin enough to meet his £100Billion pledge to help poorer nations make the switch to clean energy. Today the PM will join more than 100 world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly - the last such big gathering before the critical climate summit in Glasgow. Global leaders have already agreed that there is a £100Billion price tag to wean the poorest nations off of dirty polluting fossil fuels; but there are fears the money actually pledged by rich nations will full far short of that total. As well as pressing the flesh, Mr Johnson will use a major speech on Thursday his fellow leaders to cough up in the last 50 days before November's get together. Last night BoJo said: ""Some countries are really stepping up to the plate, others, some G20 countries, need to do much more. We'll be making that argument and set that out strongly in the next few days. But quizzed while in the air last night at his chances of success, Mr Johnson said: ""I think getting it all this week is going to be a stretch."" And he said was only sixty per cent sure it could be done before the historic meeting in Scotland in two month's time. Flanked at the UN Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and Cop26 President Alok Sharma, the PM will unveil an additional half a billion of UK taxpayer cash toward the goal. He added: ""Richer nations have reaped the benefits of untrammelled pollution for generations, often at the expense of developing countries. ""As those countries now try to grow their economies in a clean, green and sustainable way we have a duty to support them in doing so – with our technology, with our expertise and with the money we have promised."" Ahead of the visit, Mr Johnson said he would be pushing world leaders in New York to take ""concrete action on coal, climate, cars and trees"". He will also meet tech billionaire Jeff Bezos on the fringes of the United Nations General Assembly - with the PM last night vowing he will tackle the Amazon boss over their low UK tax bills and poor working conditions. Following a day at the UN, Mr Johnson will head to Washington DC for his first trip to the White House as PM. As Europe reels from the new UK and US's new defence deal with Australia, Mr Johnson is expected to hail a new pact as a key win for post-Brexit Britain. He will also hope to kickstart stalled talks on UK/US travel and trade deal between the two nations. The PM will push for talks to speed up when meeting a number of senior figures from across the political divide in Washington. Britain has allowed US citizens who are double jabbed to visit the UK since June, but the US are yet to return the favour. High on the agenda will be the messy departure from Afghanistan, after the White House refusal to delay the pull out of Kabul meant thousands were left behind to the Taliban."
105,105,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson axes slew of white men in sweeping reshuffle — to promote rising-star women,"BORIS Johnson axed a slew of white men from the lower ministerial ranks on day two of his sweeping reshuffle — to promote rising-star women. Living up to a promise to do more for government gender balance, the PM fuelled speculation of an early election by adding fresh female talent to his team. Lucy Frazer, and Helen Whately were promoted to powerful roles at the Treasury. And anti-woke warrior Kemi Badenoch was handed the key position as Michael Gove's deputy in charge of levelling up. Brexiteer Penny Mordaunt is the new No2 at the Trade Department and Gillian Keegan gets a top job at Health. Old-guard ministers John Whittingdale, Nick Gibb and James Duddridge were sacked along with Luke Hall, Justin Tomlinson and Matt Warman. But in a surprise move, Mr Johnson also axed Jesse Norman, an old school friend and husband of the vaccine tsar Kate Bingham. Tory MPs have seen Mr Johnson's shakeup as getting the government ""match fit"" for a possible early poll in as soon as 2023. Cabinet ministers think he could secure at least SEVEN more years in power after strong local election results in May and signs the economic recovery is speedier than first thought. One senior Minister said the next election ""will be sooner rather than later"" after No10 changed the law to allow them to call a General Election whenever they want. Last night senior Tories played down the idea of an early traipse to the ballot boxes, but admitted ""all options will are kept open."""
106,106,The Sun,Harry Cole,New Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries will stop woke art projects being funded by taxpayers,"NEW Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries will stop ""crackpot"" woke art projects being funded by taxpayers, a top Tory declared yesterday. Lefties slated her promotion to the Cabinet in Boris Johnson's reshuffle, as she is highly critical of the BBC and ""snowflakes"". She has called the BBC left-wing, hypocritical and patronising and has attacked woke culture for years. But Cabinet colleagues leapt to the defence of the I'm a Celebrity contestant and best-selling author. They said she will bring realism to the key role overseeing the UK's arts, TV and sport sectors. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: ""She's sold thousands and thousands of books and now if that isn't part of culture, media and sport I don't know what is. ""What's great about Nadine Dorries is she produces culture that people buy and actually want to see rather than some of the more crackpot schemes we've seen being funded in the past by taxpayers' money."" Ms Dorries, the MP for Mid Bedfordshire, has written a dozen bestsellers and made an infamous appearance in the ITV jungle in 2012, which temporarily saw her suspended from the Conservative Party. She was readmitted in 2013 and, after backing Mr Johnson to be PM, was made a health minister in 2019. But it was the 64-year-old's elevation to the top table that angered critics. The New York Times' European culture editor Matthew Anderson said: ""Germany's culture minister is a trained art historian; France's wrote a book on Verdi. The new UK culture secretary . . . ate ostrich anus on I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here."" Last night Downing Street backed Mr Wallace's claim, saying it was vital that all government departments sought the best possible value for taxpayers' money on any funding given out."
107,107,The Sun,Harry ColeKate Ferguson,Liz Truss promoted and Gavin Williamson sacked as Boris swings axe in Cabinet reshuffle,"BORIS Johnson last night crowned Liz Truss Foreign Secretary as he sacked four Cabinet ministers who helped put him in No 10 — including bungling education chief Gavin Williamson. Ms Truss was given the job after Dominic Raab, a close ally of the PM, botched Britain's exit from Afghanistan last month. Mr Raab becomes Justice Secretary, Lord Chancellor and Deputy Prime Minister. Nadhim Zahawi has been rewarded for his work as vaccines minister by taking over from Mr Williamson as Education Secretary. Meanwhile, best-selling author and former I'm a Celebrity contestant Nadine Dorries becomes the new Culture Secretary. But three other key Boris-backers in the 2019 leadership election joined Mr Williamson in being axed — Robert Buckland from Justice, Robert Jenrick from Housing and Amanda Milling as Tory Party boss. Renowned reformer Michael Gove has been tasked with fixing Britain's housing woes as well as handling demands for another Scottish independence referendum. After weeks of speculation about a reshuffle, Downing Street hailed a new look team to fix Britain from the devastation of the pandemic and wrestle day-to-day politics back on to Mr Johnson's winning agenda from two years ago. Last night he said: ""The Cabinet I have appointed will work tirelessly to unite and level up the whole country. We will build back better from the pandemic and deliver on your priorities."" But the PM's big day hit an early wobble after terse talks with Mr Raab over his demotion. Mr Raab had been heavily criticised for being on holiday as the Taliban swept across Afghanistan. While the blow was sweetened with a symbolic title of Deputy PM, allies say he was aggrieved at being blamed over the Kabul extraction and ""got a lot off his chest"" during a lengthy one-on-one. Elsewhere, devout Brexiteer Anne-Marie Trevelyan was promoted to Trade Secretary, and former Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay was elevated to Cabinet Office chief. Red-waller Simon Clarke — who resigned earlier this year as a junior minister after falling for a young aide — returned as Chief Secretary to the Treasury. But the biggest promotion of the day was for trade deal queen Ms Truss, who became Britain's top diplomat and only the second female Foreign Secretary. She had been the butt of Westminster jokes for years over her strange speeches about cheese and over-enthusiastic use of Instagram — and had been widely tipped for the axe a year or so ago. But her success signing up Britain to a slew of rollover trade deals after Brexit and a landmark new free trade accord with Australia made her an instant Boris favourite. As the longest continuously serving Cabinet minister for seven years, she now holds a Great Office of State and is the clearest female leadership contender to one day replace Mr Johnson. On the flip side, the biggest casualty of the day was sacked Education Secretary Mr Williamson. He got the boot after a string of fiascos while in charge of Britain's schools, including closing them for the first time in modern history and delays getting pupils back. He also oversaw the exams fiasco and got sucked into an ill-fated war with footballer Marcus Rashford over free school meals. Teaching unions delighted in his demise, but Downing Street said he had ""played a key role"" and that Mr Johnson was ""grateful for his loyalty and service."" VACCINES boss Nadhim Zahawi was promoted to Education Secretary after overseeing Britain's stunning jabs roll-out. The PM's long-standing ally, 54, replaced Gavin Williamson. He is the latest ethnic minority Tory put into a top position in Boris Johnson's cabinet. Mr Zahawi, born in Baghdad, fled Iraq with his parents during Saddham Hussein's early years of terror in the mid 1970s. He could barely speak English when he arrived and will now make sure millions of kids catch-up on missed learning from Covid. National Education Union's General Secretary Dr Mary Bousted said: ""The reports are that he's competent and I hope he is. ""I don't expect we will always agree, but we can expect decisions made on better evidence."" He has had a few junior posts, including one in education. FORMER I'm A Celeb Star and best-selling author Nadine Dorries was promoted to Culture Secretary in the reshuffle. The daughter of a bus driver brought up on a council estate in Liverpool, she is not afraid to ruffle Tory feathers. She once memorably branded David Cameron and George Osborne ""two posh boys who don't know the price of milk"". More recently, she has blasted leftie ""snowflakes"" and cancel culture in universities. In a taste of her priorities in her new role, she recently tweeted: ""Left-wing snowflakes are killing comedy, tearing down historic statues, removing books from universities, dumbing down panto, removing Christ from Christmas and suppressing free speech."" Sadly, it must be true, history does repeat itself. It will be music next."" Ms Dorries is one of Britain's best-known politicians after she appeared on I'm a Celeb in 2012. She failed to tell the Tory whips of her stint Down Under and was temporarily suspended from the Conservative Party as punishment. But her reality debut was short lived as she was the first contestant booted off the show. The following year, she wrote her first novel, The Four Streets, which draws on her Liverpool Catholic background. Acid-tonged reviewers panned the book, but Brits catapulted it into the best-seller list."
108,108,The Sun,Harry Cole,"All over-50s will be offered a Covid booster jab by Christmas, Boris Johnson will announce today","ALL over-50s will be offered a booster jab by Christmas as part of a Covid winter plan, PM Boris Johnson will announce today. Ministers have also approved the offer of single jabs for 12 to 15-year-olds, triggering a row over consent. They hope the additional kids' rollout will slash transmission rates in schools and prevent any further closures in the colder months ahead. Chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said last night it will ""reduce"" the risks of shutting classes in the event of a surge in cases, but will ""not eliminate"" the possibility. He added: ""We think it's an important and useful additional tool to reduce the public health impacts that come through educational disruption."" Currently only over-16s are being jabbed but there has been widespread pressure to extend the rollout. Meanwhile, the decision to give boosters to over-50s ends months of deliberation by experts. Scientists deemed one additional dose of Pfizer is the most effective booster — regardless of what people had in their two shots. The Covid winter plan, which attempts to avoid another national lockdown, will be published today. Mr Johnson said ahead of its launch: ""The pandemic is far from over. ""But thanks to our phenomenal vaccine programme, new treatments and testing we are able to live with the virus without significant restrictions on our freedoms. ""Today I will set out a clear plan for the autumn and winter, when the virus has a natural advantage, to protect the gains we have made."" Prof Whitty added: ""Anybody who believes the big risk of Covid is all in the past . . . has not understood where we are going to head as we go into autumn and winter, where there will continue to be challenges and pressure on the NHS."" For older Brits the booster rollout will begin within days, starting with the over-80s and the clinically vulnerable. Prof Whitty insisted there was enough Pfizer to go around for old and young. There were also ""no plans"" yet to jab the under-12s."
109,109,The Sun,Harry Cole,Kids aged 12+ can overrule parents to get – or refuse – Covid vaccine as roll out starts in days,"JABS for younger kids finally got the go-ahead last night — risking a battle between them and parents over consent. Children between 12 and 15 will be able to overrule mums and dads and choose whether or not to get vaccinated. But experts said kids faced being bullied and stigmatised in the playground for refusing the jab. And angry teachers and MPs demanded clearer guidance from PM Boris Johnson and his ministers. More than three million younger teens could start receiving Pfizer doses within days after Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said the ""difficult decision"" had been made to expand the rollout. Despite the US, Israel and several European countries soaring ahead of Britain's trailblazing jabs head-start, Professor Whitty said he had wanted time to assess as much of the evidence as possible before making a decision. Health chiefs said the decision was about ""balancing risk and benefits"" of the effect on kids missing more school. Prof Whitty added he was not saying children must get the jab, but there were benefits to them doing so, including protecting their mental health and stopping them missing more classes. Long-standing law in England and Wales means kids under 16 can make the case for why they should have certain medical procedures against their parents' wishes. Dubbed ""Gillick competence"", it means children can get vaccines or medicine if they can prove they fully understand the risks and are making a consenting choice. But ex-health minister Steve Brine said he was ""very concerned"", adding: ""I don't really want to set up a situation whereby we're setting up an argument — potentially a legal argument between children and their parents as to whether they should be allowed to have this vaccination."" He continued: ""Somebody emailed me this weekend saying they have to sign a consent form for teachers to put sun cream on their child. ""But now, apparently, it's going to be OK for the child to decide to have a vaccine of a very, very new drug — not something that's been around for 20 or 30 years like some of the other immunisations that we give to our children."" And Professor Simon Clarke, from Reading University, warned that giving youngsters the final say could lead to children being bullied by their peers into taking the jab. He said: ""You may end up in a situation where a minority, probably the unvaccinated, will get bullied and excluded by other children."" Dr Liz Whittaker, a children's doctor at St Mary's Hospital in West London, said: ""Under no circumstances should those young people who choose not to have the vaccine be stigmatised. ""It should not be a limiting factor for school access, extracurricular activities or school trips."" One doctor argued against the decision to even allow jabs for children. GP Renee Hoenderkamp said: ""The vaccine achieves nothing. ""Kids can still catch and transmit Covid and will get sent home when they do."" But Professor Whitty threw his weight behind kids to make their own decisions — while echoing warnings there was a risk of them being bullied in class by others who don't share their views. He insisted: ""I would not underestimate the ability of children and young people to understand important issues that affect them directly. I think it is easy to do so."" However, he added: ""It is very important there is no stigmatisation, either for accepting or not accepting vaccinations — this is critical."" He said that in the ""great majority of cases, children and parents come to the same decision"", but accepted that there was ""some debate"" about what to do if there was a family clash. Meanwhile, head teachers' union boss Geoff Barton warned his members had been threatened as the debate over jabs for kids raged. He said: ""Many have been receiving letters from various pressure groups, threatening schools and colleges with legal action if they take part in any Covid vaccination programme. ""This is extremely unhelpful and we'd ask those involved to stop attempting to exert pressure on schools and colleges. ""The question of whether or not to offer vaccinations to this age group has been thoroughly considered and the decision on whether or not to accept this offer is a matter for families."" Office for National Statistics data indicates that most parents would be likely to accept a Covid vaccine for their child. Around 86 per cent reported they would definitely, or probably, say yes. In comparison, six per cent of secondary school parents said they would definitely not want their child to have a vaccine."
110,110,The Sun,Harry Cole,Priti Patel branded ‘reckless’ over ‘secret meeting with billionaire Tory donor’,"PRITI Patel was last night branded ""reckless"" and a ""serial offender"" over claims held a secret meeting with a billionaire Tory donor and British Airways. The Home Secretary was sacked in 2018 as Aid Secretary after holding undeclared meetings with the Israeli government - without any officials present. The Sunday Mirror reported that Priti Patel arranged a meeting on August 11 at Heathrow Airport's Hilton Garden Inn, which is part of a chain owned by Tory donor Surinder Arora. Mr Arora was joined by his son and Arora strategy director, Sanjay; Arora chief financial officer Carlton Brown; the chief executive of Dubai Airports Paul Griffiths; and BA corporate affairs director Lisa Tremble. But the rulebook for ministers is clear: ""A private secretary or official should be present for all discussions relating to Government business. ""If a minister meets an external organisation or individual and finds themselves discussing official business without an official present - for example at a social occasion or on holiday - any significant content should be passed back to the department as soon as possible after the event."" A spokesman for the Home Secretary said: ""Details of all the Home Secretary's relevant external meetings will be published in the usual way in accordance with the ministerial code."" It is understood that the Home Secretary considered it a private meeting and that the lunch was declared to her private office. But Labour hit back: ""This secret lobbying lunch would break the rules three times over. She has serious questions to answer and must be investigated by the Cabinet Secretary immediately."" Nick Thomas-Symonds, Labour's shadow home secretary, added: ""The Home Secretary is so reckless about her duties that it seems she takes part in meetings behind closed doors and without an official present."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was also at the meeting without anyone from his department. The Sunday Mirror reported that he attended in his role as a local MP as Heathrow borders his Spelthorne constituency. Mr Arora said ""I've known Kwasi and Priti for years. I said pop in and have lunch and see my new hotel. ""I don't do politics. I don't support anyone. There wasn't any agenda. ""On Sunday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said his Cabinet colleague was doing ""really well"". Amid criticism of the Home Secretary's performance, Mr Javid said on Trevor Phillips On Sunday on Sky News: ""It's a really tough job, and she's doing really well."""
111,111,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson hit by brutal backlash from Tory big beasts accusing him of ‘spraying money up the wall’,"TORY big-hitters have told Boris Johnson he risks election disaster with his raid on workers' wages to plug the NHS black hole. They say voters must see the benefits of the National Insurance (NI) rise very quickly or they will desert the party. Millionaire donor Lord Ashcroft said: ""Boris Johnson is acting like a crazed Formula 1 racer with a magnum of Moët & Chandon, showering the health service with cash that risks being sprayed up the wall. ""Let us hope health chiefs use this bonanza wisely — or it will not just be patients who will die unnecessarily, but the Conservative Party's chances of re-election."" Hedge fund boss Crispin Odey said Covid set governments free to spend, adding: ""No one is better at spending than Mr Johnson. They've got the ideal drunken captain."" Their comments, backed by a slew of backbenchers, come as the PM faces a tough Tuesday forcing the tax rise law through the Commons in a single day. His party whips are hoping to whittle down the size of any rebellion after two dozen Tories refused to back his NI proposals in a Commons vote last Wednesday. His opponents also see a chance to oust marginal seat Tory MPs who voted for the rise. The Lib Dems have drawn up a hit list of 20 they think are vulnerable. But Health Secretary Sajid Javid defended the rise, insisting: ""I want that waiting list to be tackled."" MPs also fear town halls will raise bills to pay for social care as the NHS will soak up most of the new cash, meaning a tax double whammy for millions."
112,112,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Covid restrictions will NOT return this Christmas as Boris Johnson prepares to unveil Winter Plan,"BORIS Johnson will unveil his Winter Plan to avoid a Christmas lockdown tomorrow — with booster jabs for the over-50s at its core. The Sun can reveal third doses are to be rolled out in a similar way to the first vaccine drive, starting with the most elderly and vulnerable. As the vaccines are taken up they will then be offered to younger and younger age groups. The PM is pinning his hopes on avoiding widespread disruption this winter with top-up jabs and a massive flu shot blitz backed by a giant ad campaign urging people to get the double protection. If that does not work and the NHS starts coming under too much pressure, vaccine passports, more indoor masks and interventions such as working from home will have to return. Health Secretary Sajid Javid also suggested to Times Radio yesterday that ministers were considering giving children just one shot of the vaccine as part of a rollout to 12 to 15-year-olds. But he promised everything will be done to avoid another shutdown of the economy. He added: ""Of course we get Christmas. I'm not anticipating any more lockdowns. I just don't see how we get to another lockdown."" He also revealed that ministers have bowed to Tory pressure and ditched a plan for vaccine passports for clubs and stadiums at the end of this month. Mr Johnson had vowed to make jabs compulsory for big venues from the end of September, but climbed down after a major backlash from his own party. Opinion in Westminster was split over whether Mr Johnson was simply using the passports as a threat to get more people to take up the vaccine — or whether he had been warned he may not have the votes to pass them into law. In a morning of mixed messages, the Health Secretary first said no final decision had been made on Covid passports for clubbers — before confirming they would not go ahead just one hour later. Half an hour after that, Mr Javid said they would be kept under review, adding: ""What I can say is that we've looked at it properly and whilst we should keep it in reserve as a potential option, I'm pleased to say that we will not be going ahead with plans for vaccine passports."" A lot of these powers can go and we should dispose of them, but some of them are necessary to keep, such as requiring people to self-isolate if they test positive He also confirmed that some measures — such as the ability to shut workplaces and schools — will be stripped from Covid Emergency laws, but others will be rolled over for another six months. He told the BBC: ""A lot of these powers can go and we should dispose of them, but some of them are necessary to keep, such as requiring people to self-isolate if they test positive — we will keep that power."" Mr Johnson will unveil the package at a press conference tomorrow before trying to shoehorn his new health tax through the Commons the same day. There is also mounting speculation he will reshuffle his Cabinet as soon as Wednesday, before the Commons rises for the annual party conference season and Mr Johnson heads away on international travel. Last night the U-turn on vaccine passports for venues was welcomed by the hospitality industry. The co-founder of Parklife Festival, Sacha Lord, who is also night time economy adviser for Greater Manchester, said: ""The plans were untenable and illogical and there were multiple factors which would have been discriminatory and legally questionable. Today's announcement is not something to celebrate, it's merely common sense returning and I thank all those that campaigned against them. ""As a sector, we can now move forward, without hesitation or vague regulations."" Adam Brooks, landlord of the Three Colts pub in Buckhurst Hill, Essex, told The Sun: ""Since Boris threatened vaccine passports I have hardly slept with worry — worry over my industry. ""It's businesses and it's jobs. I was fearful for my kids and the possibility of an authoritarian future. ""Today's announcement is not something to celebrate, it's merely common sense returning and I thank all those that campaigned against them."" But asked whether ministers were removing too many measures designed to keep the public safe, he said the Government should not be introducing coronavirus rules ""just for the sake of it""."
113,113,The Sun,Harry Cole,Jail bosses launch probe after letter containing ecstasy sent to prisoner from PARLIAMENT,"A LETTER sent from Parliament to a prison inmate sparked a Class-A drugs probe when it was found to contain traces of ecstasy. Jail bosses have launched an investigation after the reply to the lag fell foul of sophisticated drug screening equipment and was not passed on. When the letter — written on House of Commons headed note-paper — arrived at the jail, it was found to have been exposed to a significant amount of ecstasy powder MDMA. Further investigation showed the envelope and letter, franked with the postmark of the House of Commons, contained traces of the drug, it was revealed last night. A prison source said: ""It was a very odd case but someone who has handled the letter somewhere along the line could have had enough on their hands for our scanners to pick up."" The letter was sent by a junior official in the Palace of Westminster on March 22 to HMP Coldingley in Surrey. The inmate had requested information from the Commons' library, which holds statistics and reports about parliamentary matters. This evening prison bosses confirmed to The Sun that they had launched a formal investigation. And the prison's guards have also raised the issue directly with the Ministry of Justice. The Prison Service said: ""Diligent security staff at HMP Coldingley stopped a suspicious letter reaching a prisoner. An investigation is under way."" House of Commons authorities have refused to comment. There are more than 3,000 pass-holders with access to the Parliamentary estate. It has its own internal post offices and mail service to support millions of letters sent to and from MPs every year. HMP Coldingley is a Category C men's prison."
114,114,The Sun,Harry Cole,"Keir Starmer tried desperately to stop Brexit by forcing a second referendum, new book claims","SIR Keir Starmer tried desperately to stop Brexit by forcing a second referendum. The now-Labour leader repeatedly blocked his party from supporting a compromise that would have got us out of the EU quicker, No10 aide Gavin Barwell claims. His stance collapsed cross-party talks and was allegedly a ""colossal misjudgment"" that triggered Labour's catastrophic 2019 election defeat. Sir Keir, tasked with his party's Brexit strategy, even attacked proposals that he himself had put forward. Former PM Theresa May was so desperate to get any form of Brexit deal through parliament the dying days of her premiership, that she threw open her negotiation strategy to the Labour Party. Barwell says of a compromise deal to break the bitter Brexit deadlock in spring 2019: ""Jeremy Corbyn wanted to do it, but Keir Starmer stopped it. ""It seems fitting that he's now dealing with the consequences."" He adds: ""Starmer was not prepared to settle for anything that didn't include a confirmatory vote""."
115,115,The Sun,Harry Cole,"Gavin Williamson vowed to unleash ‘world’s biggest s**tshow’ on Government, new book claims","SENIOR Tory Gavin Williamson vowed to unleash ""the world's biggest s**tshow"" on the Government, a new book claims. He allegedly made the threat while fighting for his job as Defence Secretary in 2019. The book says Mr Williamson warned then PM Theresa May he would not go quietly if she fired him. But he was given the chop after being accused of leaking state secrets — a claim he has always denied. The punchy memoir from ex-No10 chief of staff Gavin Barwell comes after a bruising week for Mr Williamson, who is widely tipped also to be sacked from his current role as Education Secretary. He was dubbed ""gaffe-a-day-Gav"" after blundering into a race storm by confusing footballer Marcus Rashford for rugby ace Maro Itoje. He has also faced flak over schools and exams chaos. In his book ""Chief of Staff — notes from No10"" — published next week, Mr Barwell says: ""Having set out why he felt he was being badly treated, Gavin moved on to threats. If the Prime Minister tried to get rid of him, there would be the world's biggest s**show. ""If we thought he was the kind of person who would take the blame for something he hadn't done, we were misjudging his personality. ""And if the Prime Minister tried to get rid of him, there would be the world's biggest s***show."" He adds that Mrs May regretted hiring Williamson and that ""Boris Johnson chose to bring him back as Education Secretary, and he has struggled in that role, too."" Last night an ally of Mr Williamson said his recollection of events differed from Mr Barwell's."
116,116,The Sun,Harry Cole,PM to green light Covid passports and booster vaccine to stop winter lockdown – but Gov wants to EXTEND powers,"BORIS Johnson will next week unveil a ""toolbox"" of contingency measures to see off a winter lockdown and keep Britain open, The Sun can reveal. Ministers will give the go-ahead to vaccine booster shots, Covid passports for clubs and stadiums and the biggest flu jab rollout in history to ease pressure on the NHS. An advertising blitz will urge the most vulnerable to get a third Covid jab and a flu shot to try to stop hospitals being overwhelmed if cases keep rising. The PM is privately vowing another lockdown is out of the question and has ordered the Government to do everything possible to avoid future restrictions. He will stress it is time to ""learn to live with Covid forever"" but wants to see the hated Coronavirus Act 2020 renewed as a precaution. The emergency powers within it expire at the end of this month, so the PM will force a vote on extending them for another six months. Dozens of Tory MPs are opposed to the move, with one MP branding renewals a ""tyranny"". Allies of the PM say the jabs rollout means this winter will be ""different"" but ministers refuse to rule out a return to some restrictions if the NHS looks under stress. It is hoped the double shot whammy will keep pressure on the health service to within seasonal norms — despite hospital admissions steadily ticking up Figures published last night reveal that 8,085 Brits are in hospital with Covid — a six-month high. The number has gone up by six per cent in a week and is at its highest since early March. However, it is still well below the second peak in January when 39,254 were in hospital — the most since the pandemic began. Hospital numbers have been rising slowly since the third wave of the virus began in May. A key ally of the PM told The Sun last night: ""The strength of our vaccination programme has changed how we tackle and live with this virus. ""It's going to be different this year. ""We will have the booster programme to give the most vulnerable an extra shot of protection and the highest number of people yet will be offered a flu jab."" Yesterday Health Secretary Sajid Javid said he felt sure the vaccine booster programme would start before the end of this month. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has said the Pfizer and AstraZeneca jabs are safe to use as boosters. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has yet to give its advice to ministers. Mr Javid said yesterday: ""We are heading towards our booster programme, so the news from the MHRA today is welcome. ""But also I want to wait for the final opinion of the JCVI. I'm confident our booster programme will start later this month but I'm still awaiting the final advice."" Leading lockdown sceptic Sir Iain Duncan Smith warned that the economy would ""drop to the levels of the Third World"" if the UK is forced into a third lockdown. He told The Sun: ""The only 'toolbox' we need is a crystal clear commitment never to shut down this country again. ""Boris promised we are on a road out and there can be no turning back. ""Unless the toolbox means no lockdowns ever again, frankly the Government will be a box of tools."" Meanwhile, ministers said last night that NHS staff could be assigned office jobs if they refuse to get a Covid jab as they floated proposals to make them mandatory. Care minister Helen Whately said: ""If you don't want to get vaccinated, how can it be right to continue to look after people who are really vulnerable from Covid?"" Vaccination will become a legal requirement for care home staff from November and it could be widened to cover everyone who comes into contact with patients. But unions warned staff will walk out, worsening shortages, if colleagues are compelled to be jabbed. Sara Gorton, of Unison, said: ""The key to convincing hesitant staff is persuasion, not force."" So far 88 per cent of NHS staff have been double-jabbed and 92 per cent have had one dose — higher rates than the public. But only 69 per cent of care workers have been double-jabbed with 82 per cent on one dose — lower than the public. COVID cases shot up in schoolkids when term started last week — but they are still stable overall. Figures show the infection rate in ten to 19-year-olds in England surged 42 per cent in the seven days to 681 per 100,000 people. The UK yesterday recorded 38,013 more cases and another 167 deaths. Covid-19 vaccinations are estimated to have directly averted 112,300 deaths in England, according to data from Public Health England and Cambridge University."
117,117,The Sun,Kate FergusonHarry Cole,Over £450million A DAY will go to NHS and social care after PM’s tax hit on workers,"HEALTH bosses will be spending £453million every day by next year — amid growing fears the NHS will swallow up all of the cash from the PM's tax raid. Experts said the Department of Health and Social Care is set to splash out 40 per cent of all government day-to-day spending from 2022. The stark sums were laid bare as Tory MPs slammed Boris Johnson for raising taxes to their highest since World War Two and throwing ""money down a bottomless pit"" to bankroll the ever-expanding health budget. A flood of policy experts and politicians warned there is a big danger the NHS will gobble up the £12billion a year raised by the National Insurance hike — leaving nothing for social care. Last night the National Insurance raid was passed in the Commons by 319 votes to 248 after potential rebels abstained. Only five Tories voted against the Government. In angry Commons scenes yesterday afternoon, former Minister Steve Baker dubbed the move ""socialist"" and close BoJo pal Jake Berry declared it was a ""Trojan Horse"" for ever higher NHS spending. Mr Berry, leader of the powerful backbench group of Northern MPs demanded answers on how waiting lists will be grappled, adding: ""Show us the plan. We cannot measure the NHS by what goes into it, we have to measure it by what comes out."" And he warned the new cash would not even go toward social care, branding the levy an NHS tax that will only ever grow. In a bid to soothe Tory nerves, Health Secretary Sajid Javid promised to be vigilant for signs the NHS is wasting its huge windfall. In a private meeting with MPs, he is understood to have told them he will hold the health chiefs' feet to the fire vowing: ""With the NHS we have to be watchful for waste and wokery that we just cannot accept."" His comments came after NHS bosses published adverts for 42 new chiefs on six-figure salaries — days after a fresh push for a slew of new diversity tsars. Mr Javid moved to soothe worries, adding: ""Colleagues will rightly think 'hold on a minute' — how do we make sure the NHS will not just gobble up that cash and it is just going to go on to new fat salaries? ""That is absolutely the right question because that's been the question on my mind all along — how we can make the NHS more efficient and focus on what people would naturally expect of it."" Tory MPs fear that by the time the medical backlog is cleared, the £12billion a year earmarked for social care will be impossible to divert away from the NHS. One ex-Cabinet Minister told The Sun last night: ""It's a suicide pact. Whatever we raise it to, it will never be enough. I hate it."" Party grandee Sir Roger Gale added: ""Are you seriously going to say that having given billions of the NHS, we're then going to take those billions away and give them to social care and not expect everybody to say you're cutting the health service funding?"" Ex-Deputy PM Damian Green chimed in: ""I cannot envisage the circumstances in which those at the top of the NHS will agree to shaving some of their own spending so a higher proportion of the levy can be diverted into care."" Another Tory MP said: ""The NHS bill always needs more. It is hard to see how this does anything other than kick that golden can down the road."" The PM last night insisted he would not let the NHS swallow up all the cash — but was unable to say when the backlog would be cleared and the money reverted to elderly care. He also could not promise people would not have to still sell their homes to pay for social care. Mr Johnson told the BBC that nobody knows ""the rate people are going to come back"" to seek treatments missed during the pandemic. The Resolution Foundation think-tank revealed spending on the health service has massively ballooned over the past 15 years, from 28 per cent of all day-to-day public spending in 2005, to  40 per cent in 2022/3. Out of a total daily spending budget of £408.4billion next year, the department is expected to get £164.8billion, the think-tank said. Separate analysis by the King's Fund think-tank suggests the department will get £153.7billion next year, and £142.8billion of this will be gobbled up by the NHS. The Resolution Foundation said the tax bomb was billed as a way to fix social care but ""should really be seen as principally about raising funds for NHS spending"". It said the country is heading for an ""ever more NHS dominated state"". NEW Covid infections crept up again yesterday amid a surge in testing as kids go back to school after summer. There were 38,975 new infections — up nine per cent on last week — as 3.6million  tests were done in three days. That compared to 2.6million tests a week earlier. Another 191 deaths were reported yesterday — down eight per cent from last week when Bank Holiday paperwork delays caused a spike. There are now 7,907 Covid patients in UK hospitals. But nearly 90 per cent of  adults have had their first jab and 80.3 per cent their second."
118,118,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha ClarkJack Elsom,Boris Johnson U-turns on manifesto pledge as he gambles on £36billion tax hike to save NHS,"BORIS Johnson last night gambled on a £36billion tax raid on workers and investors to rescue the NHS and subsidise social care. Inflicting the biggest tax burden on Brits since the Second World War, the PM tore up his 2019 manifesto to insist rises are ""fundamental to putting the NHS back on its feet"". A £12billion annual boost to Treasury coffers for at least three years will come from a double whammy 1.25 per cent hike on National Insurance and shareholder profits — branded the Health and Social Care Levy. It will initially be used to clear the NHS pandemic backlog before subsidising social care costs, capping them at £86,000 each. Mr Johnson insisted the thorny issue of helping the aged and people with disabilities had been ""ducked"" by countless governments and ""frankly should have been fixed a long time ago"". But he did not say when the backlog will clear so funds can go to elderly care — sparking fears more cash will be needed by 2025. The money raised will tackle the 5.5million-long queue for treatments — which the PM warned will get worse before it gets better. He heralded it as the ""biggest catch-up programme in NHS history"" — but disgruntled health bosses said the money ""falls short"". NHS Providers and the NHS Confederation warn the ""threat of long delays will remain"". Social care expert Sir Andrew Dilnot said the funds will not meet the ballooning costs. He added: ""My concern is more for the government, which may find that it needs to raise more money or borrow more in three or four years' time, than it is for the delivery of those social care promises."" Meanwhile, a feared massive Tory rebellion fizzled out last night as the PM sprung a Commons vote on the bombshell package today. Only Conservative Stevenage MP Stephen McPartland appeared to break cover with a threat to vote against, branding it a ""tax on jobs"". Several ministers privately let it be known they were against the measures. But no one resigned after the Cabinet met yesterday lunchtime to rubber-stamp the package. Last night the PM also dangled the prospect of a reshuffle over his colleagues as soon as this week in a bid to lock in his top team. Chancellor Rishi Sunak dropped a major hint about his discomfort, saying he respected people's concerns. But he insisted ""there is no easy or perfect way to raise money"". The PM insisted it will not hinder the fledgling economic recovery, but repeatedly failed to rule out more tax rises before the next election. He said breaking his 2019 promises was ""not something I do lightly"" but blamed Covid for upending all possible fiscal predictions. The PM said: ""A global pandemic was in no one's manifesto and I think the people of this country understand that in their bones, and they can see the enormous steps this Government and the Treasury have taken. A global pandemic was in no one's manifesto and I think the people of this country understand that in their bones. ""After all the extraordinary actions that have been taken to protect lives and livelihoods over the last 18 months, this is the right, reasonable and the fair approach."" Flanked by Mr Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid, he told a No 10 press conference last night: ""I think that what the people of this country will want after what we've all been through is honesty and fairness and rationality about the situation."" That meant not leaving ""the burden to mount up for future generations"", he added. Mr Sunak said: ""The hit the economy has taken is very different from anything that could reasonably be seen before the manifesto was written."" Mr Johnson, who also visited Westport care home in East London yesterday, said ""there are not many people in the Conservative party who are more dedicated to cutting taxes, bearing down on taxes where we can, than the three people standing before you today"". But he insisted: ""We face a reality that the fiscal position has changed radically since 2019."" Pushed repeatedly to rule out further hikes, he would only say: ""I don't want any more tax rises. If you want me to give that emotional commitment of course I will."" Defending the two fresh taxes earlier in the Commons, he said: ""It will be irresponsible to meet the costs from higher borrowing and higher debt."" The hit the economy has taken is very different from anything that could reasonably be seen before the manifesto was written. The 1.25 per cent rise in National Insurance will kick in for employers and employees — so in essence a 2.5 per cent increase — from April 20 next year. Someone on £25,000 will stump up an extra £193, while a £67,000 salary means an additional £715. Experts at the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the raid could actually bring in £14billion extra a year once NI contributions from NHS staff were taken into account. However last night the Health Secretary was unable to guarantee that the cash would be shifted to social care by 2024 as planned. Initially just one pound in six will be ploughed into care. Mr Javid said: ""We'll be able to certainly deal with a huge amount of the backlog in the next three years, and more and more of the proposition of the funding through the levy will go towards social care."" Last night business chiefs savaged the PM for hammering firms with tax raids so soon after a ""torrid"" 18 months of lockdown. The Tories can never again claim to be the party of low tax. Suren Thiru, of the British Chamber of Commerce, said the hikes would be a ""drag anchor on jobs"" and ""dampen the entrepreneurial spirit needed to drive the recovery"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer swiped: ""The Tories can never again claim to be the party of low tax"". But he ducked out of saying how he would reform social care or fix the Covid black hole. A YouGov poll found voters were split on the NI rise, with 44 per cent backing it, and 43 per cent opposed. Tracey Boles THOUSANDS of ordinary investors and small businesses will be hit by a surprise £600million tax grab on dividends yesterday. Business groups said the 1.25 percentage point rise will hammer those directors who pay themselves in dividends just as they recover from the pandemic. Ordinary people who have built up shareholdings will also be affected if they have significant portfolios outside pensions or ISAs, which shelter dividends from tax. Many pensioners rely on such dividends to boost income. Kitty Ussher, the chief economist at the Institute of Directors, accused the Government of ""a total lack of understanding to the very real difficulties faced by owners of the smallest businesses in Britain"". Those taking home more than £2,000 a year in dividends now face a higher bill. At £10,000, it means £100 more, regardless of tax bracket, with £225 for £20,000. Laura Suter, head of personal finance at stockbroker AJ Bell, said: ""Investors and the self-employed will collectively pay £600million more."""
119,119,The Sun,Harry ColeKate FergusonJonathan Reilly,What Boris Johnson’s tax hikes mean for your finances after he unveils biggest social care reforms in a generation,"BORIS Johnson went for broke yesterday with a £36billion tax raid to save the Covid-ravaged NHS and end social care injustice. Rolling the dice on his premiership, he tore up his 2019 manifesto to launch the biggest tax hike in a generation on wages and shareholder profits. It sparked fears it may cost him votes but a Tory rebellion appeared to fizzle out. The PM vowed to end the scourge of catastrophic care costs clobbering families and causing millions to fear financial ruin. Under his reforms, he said social care would be capped at £86,000 and anyone with less than £100,000 would get help. Yet MPs and experts said they were worried the NHS would snaffle the £12billion a year raised by tax rises, with social care left ""playing second fiddle"". Senior Tory MP Damian Green added: ""It is absolutely essential that social care gets its fair slice of the cake."" Mr Johnson said yesterday that the Covid-induced NHS crisis and state of social care left him no option but to put up taxes. Q: HOW much of the £36billion being raised by the new taxes will go to social care? A: Less than £5billion will go to social care in the first three years, with the rest of the cash being used to clear NHS Covid backlogs. Q: WHEN does the new regime come into place? A: It will kick in from October 2023, but you'll start paying the new taxes from next April. Q: I'M already paying for social care — will this help me? A: No. This will only apply to new cases from April 2023. Q: WILL it stop people having to sell their home to pay for social care? A: The new £86,000 cap means, in theory, most people will not have to sell their home to pay for care. Those with less than £100,000 in assets or savings will get extra government means tested support. Q: HOW does it compare to past proposals? A: The plans are less generous than was suggested by Sir Andrew Dilnot's report ten years ago, which wanted the lifetime cap placed at £35,000. But it is better than Theresa May's dementia tax which wanted the cap linked to the value of a pensioner's home. Q: HOW will the PM make sure the money for social care is not just swallowed by the NHS? A: Ministers could not guarantee that the cash raised from the new levy will go to social care from April 2024. Q: WHICH region benefits most from the care plan? A: Critics, including Red Wall Tories, point out traditional Tory heartlands will benefit most. A family living in the North East will have around £60,000 of inheritance protected, compared to an average of £414,000 in London and the South East. He said the cash raised would first go towards starting to clear the NHS backlog. No10 expects this to be about 2024. The cash would then go to social care which, he said, would get an extra £5.4billion over the next three years. Under the plan, which applies only in England, nobody will pay more than £86,000 towards care bills in their lifetime. Anyone with less than £20,000 in assets will not have to use savings or borrow against their home to pay fees. People with between £20,000 and £100,000 will get means-tested support. There will also be a consultation on how best to reform social care so it integrates the nation's patchwork of homes with the NHS. Mr Johnson told MPs it was time for governments to stop shirking the thorny issue of social care and finally face up to their responsibility. He told a packed Commons his plan would quell the anxiety that affects millions of people up and down the country. He added: ""The fear that a condition like dementia — nature's bolt from the blue — could lead to the total liquidation of their assets, their lifetime savings, their home, the loss of everything that they might otherwise pass on to their children."" Later outside No10 the PM, flanked by Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid, said the time was ripe for reform. He said: ""We are doing something that frankly should have been done a long time ago — and share the risk of these catastrophic care costs so everyone is relieved from the fear of financial ruin."" Yet according to the plan's small print, some 950,000 adults already receiving care will not benefit as the reforms are not backdated. Mr Javid said those on the other side of the October 23 start date would not benefit. He said: ""I understand the concerns but it's important we get on with the change."" Former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt backed the plan. He said: ""I can't imagine any backbenchers wanting to turn round to their own constituents and say they tried to vote down extra money for the NHS and care system."" Fiona Carragher, of the Alzheimer's Society, said it had waited a long time for this historic moment. However, she called the £86,000 cap ""worryingly high"". It should be lower, she added, if it was intended to help more than a handful of people with dementia. Prof Martin Green, chief executive of Care England, said it ""hoped that social care will be rewarded and recognised rather than playing second fiddle to the NHS"". He added: ""It is essential that money reaches the front line."" Dr Rhidian Hughes, of the Voluntary Organisations Disability Group, said he was concerned that, despite the welcome step forward, the Government's approach to policy making could leave disabled people living in England behind. He said: ""We would encourage government to prioritise solutions that work for everyone and enable older and disabled people to lead independent and fulfilling lives."" It is essential that money reaches the front line. The reforms are based on a model suggested by economist Sir Andrew Dilnot a decade ago. Last night, he said the extra cash was welcome but would not be enough. He told Times Radio there was every chance the Government might find it needed to raise more money or borrow more in three or four years. He said health spending had risen every year since 1948. The Resolution Foundation think-tank said the Department for Health's budget had grown at twice the overall rate of public spending since 2004. By 2024/25 it is set to account for 40 per cent of day-to-day spending, up from 28 per cent 20 years ago. RICHARD Chappell, 53, is a gas fitter of Newton Aycliffe, Co Durham, where the Tories won for the first time since 1931 in the last election:""This is hitting hard-working people where it hurts. It is peanuts to the rich but for me it will mean I have to work more, or make cutbacks in the home. ""They should be taxing the big corporations who are paying CEOs massive wages, not the working people."" MUM-of-one Charlotte Caleb, 31, is a record label boss, from Hertford:""We had to sell my gran's home as she has advanced dementia. It sold for £400,000 and that paid for a nice care home for four years but now the money has run out and she's in a state-funded one. ""While I would welcome a cap on care costs, I am really against a rise in National Insurance because it's hitting the wrong people."" DAD-of-two Lee Chambers, 36, from Preston, Lancs, is a director of a training company:""As a millennial, I look at our grandparents' generation and how much care costs for them and I am already thinking there won't be the support there for me. ""But it's a kick in the teeth for business owners already on their knees."" JANE Raca, 57, from Birmingham, is mum to James, 22, who has cerebral palsy:""My son will never walk, talk, get married or work. He needs two people with him at all times to keep him safe. ""Now, he is an adult, he is totally dependent on the state. ""We must find the money. ""Social care's in a dire state."" WAYNE Emmins is a warehouse worker in Redruth, Cornwall:""I broke my hip in June 1998 and have been on the NHS waiting list since 2018.""On my income, paying out even a couple of extra quid is a lot but if it means faster surgery, I'll make the sacrifice. ""My family all graft and people need surgery faster."""
120,120,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Boris Johnson to unveil tax hike on shareholder profits as well as National Insurance hike today,"BORIS Johnson today unveiled a massive raid on shareholder profits to raise billions for the NHS and Social Care. The PM today revealed a 1.25 per cent hike to National Insurance contributors from workers and firms today - as well as a new tax assault on investors. Cabinet sources say people paid in dividends will still be allowed a personal allowance before the the new tax hike kicks in, with only the most profitable investors affected. The PM and Chancellor Rishi Sunak will hope the move will offset claims that their raid on workers' wages is unfair as well as raise additional billions every year to plug fiscal black-holes in both the NHS and social care budgets. Boris said in his Commons statement: ""We will be asking better-off business owners and investors to make a fair contribution too. ""In fact, the highest earning 14 per cent will pay around half the revenues, no-one earning less than £9,568 will pay a penny, and the majority of small businesses will be protected, with 40 per cent of all businesses paying nothing at all."" But the move is likely to trigger an angry backlash from Tory MPs who claim to be the party of capitalism. Boris Johnson today broke a key election promise by hitting millions with more taxes. He confirmed:"
121,121,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson to warn NHS will NEVER recover from Covid without tax rises as he axes vow not to hike National Insurance,"BORIS Johnson will today warn the NHS will never recover from Covid without tax rises as he shreds his manifesto promise not to hike National Insurance. In a bid to see off a massive Tory rebellion, the PM will vow to use the cash to increase current NHS capacity by a million treatments a year to try to shift the pandemic backlog by the next Election. His allies claim that boost will see a 10 per cent increase in current capacity in the next two to three years as BoJo vowed not to ""duck the tough decisions needed to get NHS patients the treatment they need."" A 1.25 per cent raise to NI contributions from both workers and firms will then be used to fund the ""catastrophic"" black hole in social care - with care costs capped at £80,000 a year. The point at which the elderly begin to pay for their own care will also be significantly raised. Last night Downing Street said: ""Under the current care system, anyone with assets over £23,350 pays for their care in full. ""This can lead to spiralling costs and the complete liquidation of someone's assets. Around one in seven people now pay over £100,000, and there is an unfair and often catastrophic discrepancy between someone who has dementia paying for their care in full, while someone cared for by the NHS receives care for free."" No10 also claimed 5 million people are still waiting for surgery and treatment since the virus hit and that could more than double to 13 million without an urgent cash injection. Mr Johnson will use a press conference today flanked by the Health Secretary and Chancellor - who signed off the plan over the weekend - to insist Covid has ""changed the NHS for the foreseeable future"". Last night the PM said: ""The NHS is the pride of our United Kingdom, but it has been put under enormous strain by the pandemic. We cannot expect it to recover alone. ""We must act now to ensure the health and care system has the long term funding it needs to continue fighting COVID and start tackling the backlogs, and end the injustice of catastrophic costs for social care."" But his plan has been hit by a torrent of criticism as the retired do not pay National Insurance and it disproportionately hits the lower paid. Senior Tory MP John Redwood branded the plan stupid and one of the PM's closest friends warns in today's Sun he must think again on his ""inherently unfair"" raid. Former Northern Powerhouse Minister Jake Berry writes: ""Young working families who struggle to pay their mortgages and put shoes on their kids' feet will be paying for the care of wealthy pensioners who don't pay NI. That's inherently unfair. It's the opposite of this Government's levelling up agenda. It's levelling down."" Mr Johnson was swept to his landmark 2019 election win on a pledge not to touch NICs, but last night ministers insisted the ""unforeseeable"" pandemic had left the manifesto in tatters. Mr Johnson is also expected to announce a temporary pause on his pensions triple lock promise - to stop pensioners getting a whopping 8 per cent rise this year. But the move will require legislation setting up a major parliamentary showdown. Last night Mr Sunak told Tory MPs there was a ""tough autumn ahead"" with ""disagreements"" coming. However, Red Wall poster girl Dehenna Davison, who turned Bishop Auckland in Durham blue, blasted: ""I was elected on this manifesto… we absolutely cannot go against this manifesto"". And Rother Valley MP Alex Stafford warned: ""Conservatives should not be raising taxes willy nilly."" That's inherently unfair. It's the opposite of this Government's levelling up agenda. It's levelling down. Yesterday Mr Berry - who left the Cabinet last year- also turned fire on Health Secretary - accusing him of being a tax rise turn coat. The Northern Tory ringleader hit out: ""When I was sat round that Cabinet table and Sajid Javid was the chancellor of the exchequer writing the Conservative Party manifesto, he was a great believer in not racking up the jobs tax and I just wonder why he's had a sort of Damascene conversion when becoming the Health Secretary to seeing the jobs tax as the way forward."" Mr Johnson's Cabinet will meet tomorrow to rubber stamp the plan - with as many as five said to be privately opposed to the tax raid. There was also anger last night that the majority of ministers were kept in the dark about the details ahead of the meeting. One branded the plan ""electoral roulette"" after Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg warned publicly that voters have long memories for broken promises over tax. In a bid to quell Tory anger at the move, both Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak pressed the flesh last night in person at a party welcoming MPs back to Westminster after the summer break and lockdown. Mr Sunak made a public show of loyalty to the PM and urged all Tories to get behind Mr Johnson, saying: ""I, like all of you, take our lead from the Prime Minister. The leader of our party and the country. We owe him our support and loyalty."" Around one in every five Pounds raised in taxation already comes from NICS, taken at source on wages of more than £9,564 a year, or £184 per week. I, like all of you, take our lead from the Prime Minister. The leader of our party and the country. We owe him our support and loyalty. Workers then pay 12 per cent on earnings over this amount and up to £50,268, or £967 a week. A raise of 1 per cent would see those earning £15,000 pay around £54 a year more under the new raid, and those earning £25,000 stump up £154 more. NICs on earnings of £35,000 would increase by £254 a year and on a salary of, £50,000 would go up by £404. The Sun Says, Opinion BORIS Johnson is kidding himself if he believes he can casually break his manifesto promises and raise taxes without paying a heavy price at the ballot box. The PM is buoyed by polls showing most people are apparently happy to fork out extra to fund social care — and content that the unprecedented disaster of Covid justifies binning election pledges. It is fool's gold, Boris. We don't know all the details of the looming National Insurance tax rise. We do know that if the proceeds are swallowed by the NHS, and prove NOT to be the lasting social care solution he has advertised, enraged voters will feel doubly betrayed. And we highly doubt any improvement will be visible by the next election anyway. The NHS has dibs on the money initially and will fight tooth and nail to keep it before it begins being diverted to social care. There are no easy solutions. Especially if you rule out meaningful cuts such as scrapping the £98billion HS2 project, a new railway in the video-call age. But a NI hike pilfering from struggling young workers so wealthy OAPs needing care can keep their homes is clearly unfair. Even roping pension-age workers into the NI scheme would be better. Anyone expecting alternatives from Labour need not hold their breath. Besides sniping at the Government, they are keeping schtum until the next election. Why? Because they haven't the foggiest what to do. All those years out of power, yet they are still too busy scrolling Twitter to produce policy. This — clueless Keir Starmer's bickering, braindead shambles — is the official Opposition. No wonder Boris is so over-confident, gambling on a tax rise and defying his MPs and voters."
122,122,The Sun,Jack ElsomKate FergusonHarry Cole,Dominic Raab finally joins Tory MPs foreign affairs group chat TWO YEARS into the job,"EMBATTLED Dominic Raab has finally joined the Tory MPs' foreign affairs WhatsApp group - TWO YEARS into the job. Fighting to stay in post amid a raging holiday row, the Foreign Secretary scrambled to win support from irked colleagues by showing he's easy to reach and wants to listen. He was added to the chat by his parliamentary bag-carrier Joy Morrissey MP this morning, The Sun can reveal. Such groups are a hotline between ministers and backbench MPs with a keen interest in their departments. Mr Raab's panicked entrance likely shows he's feeling the heat from furious calls for him to resign or be sacked. But MPs were dumbfounded that it's taken him so long to join. One astonished Tory on the group told The Sun: ""I never realised he wasn't on the group. You assume the Secretary of State is going to be on the group. ""I think he has been a bit complacent. It would be nice if he was in listening mode more. It will be good for him."" Another said: ""It's the first time I've ever seen him in there - better late than never to get on the phone."" The Foreign Sec's charm offensive came as he mounted his defence against claims he declined an urgent call with Kabul during his holiday to Crete last week. In a rare statement Mr Raab admitted not picking up the phone to his Afghan counterpart Hanif Atmar - but was adamant it wasn't a priority. As the Taliban marched on the capital he said the planned call was ""quickly overtaken by events"". The Cabinet Minister - Boris's second-in-command - says he is not resigning and Downing Street says it has ""full confidence in him""."
123,123,The Sun,Jonathan ReillyHarry Cole,Priti Patel blasts French police for allowing thousands of migrants to cross the Channel,"PRITI Patel launched a furious tirade against the French for failing to stop thousands of migrants crossing the Channel. The Home Secretary told Tory MPs she was questioning the methods of French police on their northern beaches. Her outburst came after she signed off millions to fund their shore patrols. Ms Patel handed another £54million to help them police the French coast. But the number of migrants setting off on the dangerous crossing continues to grow. On Thursday 592 made the journey in a single day — a new record. Ms Patel said she expected Paris to deploy extra police to the beaches as soon as possible. She wants them to set up a taskforce with Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands to stop people traffickers. Home Office insiders are braced for a new wave of refugees in the next few months, triggered by chaos in Afghanistan following the US withdrawal. A source said: ""Both the UK and France must do everything in their power to reverse the appalling increase in small boats. ""We're taking rapid action here at home with our new plan for immigration and the borders bill. ""It cuts down the pull factors and the things we can control. But it's important France now surges its efforts to prevent these dangerous crossings."" About 150 migrants, including five toddlers, crossed the Channel by small boats yesterday. Babies too young to walk were among those spotted arriving in Dover. They were carried ashore by officials after being brought into the port on a Border Force patrol boat. The crossings followed 25 migrants being detained in a single boat on Friday. So far this year 11,314 have arrived, compared with 2020's previous record number of 8,410. The Home Office is yet to confirm the total number of interceptions. But it is likely to take August's tally over 2,000 as figures show 1,899 have crossed in 61 boats so far. A spokesman for Ms Patel declined to comment."
124,124,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha Clark,"Boris Johnson will be hammered by Red Wall voters over cost of green revolution, furious Tory MPs say in WhatsApp tirade","RAGING Red Wall Tory MPs turned fire on ministers last night after shock polling revealed Tory voters will be hit hardest by Boris Johnson's expensive green revolution. The PM's Northern troops launched a blistering private assault on the Climate Change Minister in a fiery WhatsApp tirade seen by The Sun. Stark polling shared in a private text chat for Tory MPs revealed that 44 per cent of all car owners backed the Conservative voters, rising to 47 per cent of all petrol drivers. Just one in five hybrid-owners backed the party, and nearly seven in ten electric car drivers opted for Labour instead. With Ministers urging Brits to switch as soon as possible away from combustible engines - tensions boiled over with claims the Tories would be hit hardest by the government diktat. A string of rising stars first elected in 2019 took to the Conservative MP WhatsApp group chat to hammer lofty Anne Marie Trevelyn, the Business Department minister. And they pleaded it would be MPs not ministers who had to sell the plans on the doorstep or risk losing thousands of voters - and even the next Election. The angry Tories expressed their deep concern over the electoral cost of pursuing green policies, with just three months to go before Mr Johnson hosts a crucial COP26 climate change summit in November. This will not go down well in Red Wall seats at all. Ministers are yet to lay out their plans for how Brits will have to rip out their boilers and make their homes more environmentally friendly to meet Net Zero goals by 2050 - over internal wrangling about the price tag. But Ashfield MP Lee Anderson fumed: ""This will not go down well in Red Wall seats at all."" Former minister Jackie Doyle-Price added: ""The reason we have won Red Wall seats is because Labour lost working class voters over decades as the party has become increasingly metropolitan. We won't keep those voters if they see us behaving in the same way. We do need to get our approach to net zero right."" Lincoln's Karl McCartney added: ""All the builders, mechanics, petrol-heads and even EV lovers across the country will be rolling their eyes at this 'idealism'. Others need to pull their weight, rather than us doing all the legwork. ""Maybe the SpAds/advisers in No10 and certain departments should leave their protective bubble ever recess and head 'north'."" And Bassetlaw's Brendan Clarke-Smith hit out at the international approach too, adding: ""It's a hard sell asking people to make sacrifices when the rest of the world, China/Russia etc, are carrying on as usual. ""It can't happen overnight - and others need to pull their weight, rather than us doing all the legwork."" Workington MP Mark Jenkinson, who has rallied against the decision to hit pause on a new coal mine in Cumbria, warned of the risks of shutting them all down to simply buy it all in from China and Russia to make steel. And he warned that developing countries benefiting from coal at the moment were never going to get on side ahead of COP26. He stressed: ""We are ultra-parochial on Net Zero, and we're simply not the problem. ""We're pulling up the drawbridge and expecting others to leapfrog the path we took to prosperity. It hasn't happened in any developed country."" Another added: ""You cannot make steel without burning coal - fact. ""Of course we have to reduce emissions, but chasing after headlines without the proper consideration of the economic impact is idiocy. ""We have been trying to save our steel industry for the last ten years - on the basis of this, we shouldn't have bothered."" However, Lichfield MP Michael Fabricant joked: ""No wonder Jeremy Clarkson votes for us!"""
125,125,The Sun,Harry Cole,"Red Arrows’ red, white and blue smoke trails are going GREEN to save the planet","THE Red Arrows red, white and blue smoke trails are going green to save the planet, The Sun can reveal. The Ministry of Defence has quietly asked private industry to help make the famous jet engine vapour displays less polluting. The Red Arrows fly two-seater Hawk T1 jets with a top speed of 645 mph and delight millions with their colourful displays - but it comes with a cost to the environment. Currently red or blue dye is mixed with dirty diesel before being injected into the scorching exhaust to make the famous smoke streams. But now top military boffins want to replace the diesel with a green friendly replacement solvents within months. In March the RAF vowed to go net-zero within 19 years. Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston, the Chief of the Air Staff, publicly vowed to do all he could ""to be the first net-zero air force by 2040"". On Monday the MoD published call to arms to help create an ""environmentally friendly coloured smoke dye and a diesel solvent alternative for aerobatic displays."" It explains: ""For the display aircraft to produce coloured smoke during display, dye is mixed with a solvent and stored on a pod attached to the aircraft. ""This mixture is then injected into the hot exhaust of the jet engine whilst in flight to produce the coloured smoke. ""In order to be at the forefront of initiatives that reduce waste, conserve energy and promote the environment, the MoD are seeking coloured smoke dyes and alternative solvents that minimise the impact on the environment while maintaining a high level of performance."" Last night an RAF source said: ""As global ambassadors for Britain and the RAF, the Red Arrows look for excellence in all they do, for them to consider use environmentally friendly smoke dye, shows they are continuing to lead the field. ""Always Red White and Blue, the addition of green credentials is a great thing""."
126,126,The Sun,Harry Cole,Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng hits out at Government dithering on how to pay for gas boiler removal,"BUSINESS Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng hit out at his own government's dithering about how to pay for stripping gas boilers out of millions of homes. Downing Street has repeatedly delayed a promised ""Heating and Buildings Strategy"" amid fears of a massive backlash over the true cost of its Net Zero push. Boilers produce nearly 15 per cent of Britain's carbon emissions - which the government has vowed to abolish by 2050. But the Cabinet is split on how to avoid hitting poorer Britons with massive bill to go green. Eco-friendly heating replacements are currently far more expensive than gas boilers and Tory MPs have warned of poll tax style riots if the poorest households are left out of pocket. Yesterday Mr Kwarteng broke cover to demand new forms of taxation to ""help people make the transition"". He pointed to carbon taxes as a solution - however the Treasury have yet to approve any plans. The Business Secretary told the BBC: ""we want to try and help people make that transition"" and vowed to protect the poorest households. He added: ""We've got a Heat and Buildings Strategy that is going to come out very soon, but… I'm very keen to see it published because I think that will set out a number of options."" The strategy had been promised earlier this year and was delayed until after the summer break amid cross-department squabbles and warnings from MPs not to clobber workers. Last night Downing Street said it ""did not recognise"" the claims of a delay, but added ""important work"" was still being carried out on the policy paper."

Efforts to persuade Whitehall staff to return were abandoned. And threats to dock their wages for staying at home were ditched too. Ministers had been said to be planning a drive to get officials back at their desks in the autumn. An unnamed senior Cabinet figure claimed they should even have their pay reduced for continuing to work from home. However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman insisted yesterday: ""We have no plans for that approach."" And within hours of the plans to get them back to offices being made public, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng insisted there would be no ""Government diktats"" on 400,000 civil servants returning. And the future of office work would be up to individual firms. To add to the confusion, Mr Kwarteng did later warn that those workers who do not return to the office would be left at a professional disadvantage He had told the BBC: ""I think flexible working is something that is here to stay."" But moments later he told Times Radio: ""If you look at human organisations, people do build relationships and build networks through face to face contact. People who come into office may have an advantage in that."" Last night, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner blasted the Tories by saying: ""They can't agree amongst themselves, never mind provide clarity to businesses or to workers."""

Government insiders say the cycling superstars, who flew home with their medals yesterday, are certainties for the accolades. One top source revealed after the pair grabbed glory again in Tokyo: ""I think you can expect Team GB's golden couple to be showered with gongs next. ""The whole team deserve massive praise but the Kennys' historic achievements will be top of the list to be honoured."" The couple led a victory march of returning heroes through Heathrow Airport yesterday after becoming Britain's top male and female Olympians of all time. Jason, 33, won gold in a thrilling keirin final on the last day after silver in the team sprint to take his medal tally to a record nine. His seventh gold took him clear of Sir Chris Hoy as Britain's greatest at the Games. The whole team deserve massive praise but the Kennys' historic achievements will be top of the list to be honoured. Laura, 27, added a fifth gold to the glittering collection she started at London 2012 plus a silver in the team pursuit, taking her medal count to six. After a sporting supershow dubbed the greatest in our Olympic history, Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee chair Julian Knight also predicted a flood of honours. Britain finished a brilliant fourth in the medals table at the Covid-hit Games, with a haul of 65, including 22 golds. Mr Knight said: ""It's incredible to think that the plucky Brits have won more golds than the Russians, Australians and many of the nations of the EU combined."" The Queen said in a message to Team GB they had been ""an inspiration to us all"". Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: ""Our athletes have trained in the most difficult of circumstances and, despite the challenges of the pandemic, they have brought the entire nation together as we've cheered them on from our TV screens."" Ex-Sports Minister Tracey Crouch urged the Government to continue backing them with funding."
129,129,The Sun,Harry Cole,Temporary pop-up accommodation planned to house Britain’s record number of migrants crossing Channel,"MINISTERS warn that pop-up accommodation will soon be needed to house Britain's record number of small-boat migrants. About 10,000 have already made the dangerous, illegal Channel crossing this year. Many more are expected as the good weather returns, and Border Force warn that the total could top 20,000 by the end of the year. Huge numbers of arrivals are being housed in budget hotels in Kent and the home counties but insiders say capacity is ""utterly full"". Town halls are struggling to find so-called dispersal accommodation in their housing stock — and hotels 85 miles away in upmarket areas of London such as Islington and Kensington are being used to accommodate migrants. Now the Home Office wants to speed up plans for temporary facilities to cope with the huge influx, and locations for reception centres near Dover are now being scouted. Home Secretary Priti Patel wants ""one-stop"" facilities — as used in Denmark and Switzerland — to ""provide basic accommodation in line with our statutory obligations"". They could also be used to detain failed asylum seekers as they wait to be deported. Last night an ally of Ms Patel told The Sun: ""Priti hates using hotels. She's made that very clear to her officials. ""That's why her Nationality and Borders Bill sets out her plans to end our reliance on hotels by using purpose-built reception centres which can provide simple but safe accommodation."" French police have managed to stop just 8,000 would-be migrants reaching English beaches, sparking growing tension between Ms Patel and her Paris counterparts."
130,130,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Just 607 criminal behaviour orders slapped on thugs last year – down a third in five years,"JUST 607 Criminal Behaviour Orders were slapped on convicted thugs and antisocial menaces last year - down a third in five years. The court orders are designed to tackle persistent offenders and can be handed out alongside any other conviction for a criminal offence. They were introduced in 2014 in a bid to toughen up ASBOs, but Labour say they have been abandoned and the justice system cannot cope with cases. In 2015, 952 criminal behaviour orders were issued but their use has plummeted ever since. Labour's Shadow Justice Secretary David Lammy said last night: 'The Government is failing to tackle sky-rocketing anti-social behaviour because its 11 years of cuts have pushed the justice system to the brink of collapse. ""Labour will ensure victims of persistent antisocial behaviour get justice, by investing in their communities and strengthening their rights."" The orders can last up to two years. Controls can include banning offenders from drinking in public places or meeting at certain times."
131,131,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Voters in ‘Red Wall’ areas a third more likely to be murdered as Boris Johnson falls short on vow to level up Britain,"BRITS in ""red wall"" areas were almost third more likely to be murdered last year, a damning report reveals. Boris Johnson is falling woefully short on his vow to level up Britain according to a study that lays bare the North/South divide. In the 43 mainly northern and midlands areas that switched from Labour to Conservative in the 2019 General Election, around a third more adults have no qualifications when compared with the rest of the country. Big private investment firms plugged just £83.20 per head into those regions, compared to a national average of £145.60 last year. And businesses in other parts of the country were able to borrow at rates 42 per cent higher, and start up rates are almost a fifth lower in the red wall. A landmark study by Legatum Institute on prosperity in Britain shows just how far Boris Johnson is falling short of his vow to level up the nation so far. Their UK Prosperity Index 2021 found there are 13.8 per cent more deaths between the ages of 20 and 64 in the ""red wall"" and 31 per cent more homicides compared with the national average. The ""red wall"" seats swept the Tories to an historic Election win in 2019, but those voters are still amongst the most left behind in Britain. The study compared more than 256 different indicators of prosperity across all 379 local authorities in Britain. And it found that the Red Wall areas that put Mr Johnson into power remain significantly less well off that the rest of the country. But 35 of the 43 areas - four fifths - are in the bottom half of the league table. Voters there are also more likely to have diabetes, be disabled or be obese and rates for alcohol misuse are higher and life expectancy is more than a year lower. Last night, the PM's own Tory MPs in the North and Midlands called for action. Hartlepool came 361th out of 379 on the prosperity rankings - and their MP Jill Mortimer said: ""My town voted Conservative for the first time in a generation because of our promise to level up and create better opportunities. ""After two years of a pandemic and lockdown, that task has been made so much harder. ""My constituents don't want Government handouts - they want targeted solutions that empower them, their families and their communities to earn their way to prosperity. And Jonathan Gullis MP for Stoke-on-Trent North - which came 356th out of 379 in the Index - added:  ""The Prime Minister was absolutely right to promise to level up and bring opportunity to the Midlands and the North. ""But now we've got to deliver. Levelling up must be about skills and jobs."" The study found that the number of adults with no qualifications in the 43 Red Wall seats that went from Labour to Tory in the 2019 election was a third higher than elsewhere. Baroness Philippa Stroud, CEO of the Legatum Institute, said of Red Wall levelling-up: ""The lack of access to business loans and adult qualifications are clearly some of the key places to start."""
132,132,The Sun,Harry ColeJonathan ReillyJoe Duggan,Boris Johnson will swerve traffic light travel chaos and take a staycation with Carrie in the UK this summer,"BORIS Johnson will swerve the travel traffic light chaos and ""staycation"" in Britain this year. Amid a massive backlash over dithering government advice on holidays, the PM and Carrie Johnson will stay at home for a break later in the coming weeks. But it's unlikely they will pick Scotland again after a disastrous camping trip last year ended in testy Commons scenes with Mr Johnson blaming the SNP for leaking his location, forcing him to abandon his tent in a security scare. Sources say the PM and his wife will also stay with Queen at Balmoral later this month in the premier's traditional holiday with Her Maj. Last night, he scrapped plans for a new amber watchlist travel tier after criticism from industry experts, airlines and MPs. The PM said he hoped to make holiday advice ""as simple as possible"" for Brits heading abroad. Officials had wanted a new tier added to the red, amber and green system warning holidaymakers warning their destination could turn red soon. But the move was scrapped over fears it would over-complicate travel plans. It means the amber plus sub-category will also probably be axed, with Brtis wanting to head to France getting a holiday boost. France is currently the only country on the amber-plus list, after it was excluded from the amber list restrictions being lifted. Brits who have had both jabs can currently return from amber destinations - which includes Spain, Greece and Portugal - and follow the same rules as the green list. The Sun understands that the extra category for France is set for the axe within days if the Beta variant cases continue to fall there. This week, the findings of the government's next travel review are set to be unveiled, when the changes are likely to be confirmed and would come into effect from Monday. Mr Johnson said: ""I obviously understand that people care very much about holidays. People want to go abroad. ""I understand how much people plan, prepare, for the summer holidays. ""But we've also got to remember that it's still a dangerous virus. What I want to see is something that is as simple and as user- friendly for people as possible ""We must stop importing variants from abroad and we have to have a balanced approach. ""What I want to see is something that is as simple and as user- friendly for people as possible."" MPs had warned the Government risked creating travel havoc. Tory Henry Smith said: ""If you add extra layers in a traffic light so it becomes almost like a rainbow, it just creates confusion which is unnecessary."" Holiday operators and airlines welcomed the Prime Minister stepping in. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, which represents BA, easyJet and Ryanair, said the decision would be a victory for common sense. He added: ""The PM has hit the nail on the head."
133,133,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Brits face norovirus epidemic which could spread in ‘combination’ with Covid from next month,"BRITS face an ""unpredictable epidemic"" of messy norovirus from next month that could spread in ""combination"" with Covid. Government scientists have raised the alarm that rates of the seasonal vomiting and tummy bug are way down this year - and could explode from September. Because we have all been washing our hands more, wearing masks and staying at home, there has been a drop in colds, flu and other seasonal illnesses spreading. So the boffins fear Britain is ripe for an unusually large outbreak because the ""transmission dynamics"" have changed. They point to September and October as ""particularly risky points"" and flagged the grim norovirus as a particular cause for concern. They had already warned that flu could be particularly bad this year - with more flu jabs rolled out in preparation - but now norovirus has been added to the list of concerns. Noro's most common symptoms include diarrhoea, vomiting and a high temperature. But scientists warn that could make spotting Covid cases ""more difficult"" if there is a big peak of both bugs. An inner committee of the SAGE group of scientists that advises Downing Street have now warned ministers it could get so bad that pressures on the NHS would be ""exacerbated"". Last month top doc Chris Whitty warned the NHS to ""brace"" itself for a hard winter – with a flu surge likely. He told a medical conference ""the coming winter may well be quite a difficult one"". On Covid he warned: ""We know that winter and autumn favour respiratory viruses, and therefore it'd be very surprising if this particular highly transmissible respiratory virus was not also favoured."" There is also a fear that such a big outbreak could trigger unknown problems that the NHS is not yet prepared for should there be ""interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and other infections, both in combination and in competition"". The warning came from the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, Operational sub-group, in a paper dated July 15. To reduce the risk of infection: Pay close attention to hygiene. Wash your hands frequently, using soap and water. Avoid close contact with people who are obviously sick. If you or members of your household are ill: It reads: ""During the past 18 months, diseases such as influenza, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and norovirus, have been circulating much less in the population than in previous years. ""Their transmission dynamics have changed due to the measures to control COVID-19 and, as a result, there may be a period of unpredictable epidemics of these diseases before their normal seasonal patterns return.

134,134,The Sun,Harry ColeChris Pollard,Teenagers aged 16 and 17 to be offered vaccine within days in drive to stop Covid spread before new school year,"YOUNGSTERS aged 16 and 17 will get the green light for Covid jabs within days. The news comes as a study found having two vaccine doses makes people at least half as likely to catch it. But Brits also face an ""unpredictable epidemic"" of the norovirus winter vomiting bug from next month that could spread in combination with the coronavirus. With most people washing their hands more, wearing masks and staying at home, there has been a drop in colds, flu and other seasonal illnesses spreading. So the experts fear Britain is ripe for an unusually large outbreak because the ""transmission dynamics"" have changed. They view September and October as a ""particularly risky point"" and flagged the grim norovirus as a particular cause for concern. And the vaccines plan for 16 and 17-year-olds comes amid growing fears of a fresh wave of Covid cases when kids go back to school and the weather gets worse. Ministers have been privately pushing for a jabs drive for those ages before they return. And the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation is poised to give the nod as soon as the weekend, The Sun has learnt. The roll-out to children would begin almost immediately, insiders were saying. A Whitehall source told The Sun last month they were pushing for the move, saying: ""Late teens are some of the most socially active members of society so if we can cut that transmission, it can only be a good thing."" A hint of the coming decision was dropped by Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon last night, who said: ""I am hoping, possibly veering towards expecting, updated advice from the JCVI literally in the next day or so. And I very much hope that expectation will prove to be the case. ""And I am hoping, but this is the JCVI's advice, that they will recommend further vaccination of people in the 12 to 18-year-olds age group. ""But I'm particularly hopeful that we will see some updated recommendations in relation, as a priority as a first part of this, for 16 and 17-year-olds."" Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""With the JCVI apparently about to give the green light to vaccinating 16-year-olds, ministers need to ensure plans are in place to roll out this vital next stage of vaccination while ensuring parents have all the facts and information they need."" Meanwhile, double-jabbed people were estimated to have a 50 to 60 per cent reduced risk of infection compared to unvaccinated people. The React-1 study by Imperial College London found 3.84 per cent who had recent contact with a known Covid case tested positive, compared to 7.23 per cent of unvaccinated. Those who were fully vaccinated are also less likely to pass on the virus to others. Prof Paul Elliott, of ICL, said: ""Both doses of a vaccine offer good protection against getting infected. ""However, there is still a small risk as no vaccine is 100 per cent effective, so we should still act with caution to help protect one another and curb the rate of infections."" The study found prevalence of the virus has grown, with around one in 160 infected — a four-fold rise compared with last month. The rate among the unvaccinated was 1.21 per cent, compared with 0.40 per cent among those who were double-jabbed. More than half of people admitted to hospital with Covid are unvaccinated, and just 19 per cent had two jabs. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""Our vaccination rollout is building a wall of defence that means we can carefully ease restrictions and get back to the things we love, but we need to be cautious as we learn to live with this virus."" Data from Public Health England shows vaccines are highly effective against all variants of Covid. Jabs have prevented 22 million infections, 52,600 hospitalisations and up to 60,000 deaths. Amid the latest positive Covid news, Government scientists have raised the alarm that rates of the norovirus could explode from September. They had already warned that flu could be particularly bad this year — with more flu jabs rolled out in preparation. But now norovirus has been added to the list of concerns.

The PM blamed the hostile state for the hit on oil tanker Mercer Street that left the security guard and a Romanian sailor dead - and is working with the US and Israel on how to respond. Government sources said a ""range of options"" was being drawn up for retaliation after Thursday's attack off Oman. A senior defence source said the most likely would be in cyberspace, warning ""nobody will see it here but they will be left in no doubt you cannot kill a Brit unchecked"". A Foreign Office insider added: ""A British national was killed and we have to make clear there are certain lines that can't be crossed."" But the Foreign Secretary's first priority yesterday was rallying the UN Security Council and other powers in the Gulf to condemn Tehran's behaviour. A Special Forces team flew out to join the stricken tanker and take charge of the investigation tonight. A source said they did not believe the unnamed Brit had been deliberately targeted. Iran's ambassador to the UK was summoned for a dressing down in London, but insiders said the regime's response was ""all smoke and mirrors"". Middle East minister James Cleverly told the Iranian diplomat that Tehran must ""immediately cease actions that risk international peace and security"". The PM said Iran should ""face up to the consequences of what they have done"" and called on them to ""respect freedoms of navigation"". Chair of the Commons Defence Select Committee Tobias Ellwood said the attack ""demands a proportionate response"". ""For too long the West has allowed Iran's interference across the Middle East to go unchecked,"" he said. ""This latest drone strike on the high seas, which saw a Briton, killed absolutely demands a proportionate response from the UK, in concert with our allies."" The Mercer Street is managed by London-based Zodiac Maritime, part of Israeli billionaire Eyal Ofer's Zodiac Group."
136,136,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Kids from poorest parts of Britain TWICE as likely to be mugged,"KIDS from the poorest parts of Britain are TWICE as likely to be mugged, Labour said tonight. They are also SEVEN times more likely to be the victim of a snatch theft - like a rapid drive-by moped mugging. And crime data shows the under-18s growing up in the most deprived parts of England and Wales are also TWICE as likely to experience violence at home. New analysis of the Office for National Statistics crime data by the opposition shows that households in the very poorest areas of the country are more than FOUR times more likely to have their car stolen and TWICE as likely to have it damaged. Labour have studied the Crime Survey of England And Wales for the first quarter of 2020, comparing the rates of crime hitting the poorest 20 per cent of areas, compared to the richest fifth. Overall the poorest areas have 14 per cent more violent crime hitting the under 18s. And across nearly all categories of household crimes, those living in the most deprived areas are far more likely to be victims than those in the least deprived. The study was undertaken by Labour's new Child Poverty Secretary Wes Streeting, who told The Sun: ""Boris Johnson's Tories have become the party of crime and disorder, letting down the most vulnerable kids in our country."" The revelations are particularly concerning given that just last month the Home Office admitted the Covid crisis and poverty are causing growing alarm about soaring crime rates. They said: ""unemployment, poverty and income inequality could lead to upward pressure on crime and increased support for extremist groups or political parties; both factors are heavily influenced by the duration and scale of impacts from Covid-19."" Mr Streeting  is demanding the PM ditch plans for a £200 million for a new Royal yacht to drum up trade around the world and spend the earmarked cash fighting crime instead. He hit out: ""Labour has consistently called for the Government to scrap the PM's vanity yacht project and to use that money to tackle the rise in anti-social behaviour""."

Courageous Carrie, 33, revealed she lost a baby earlier this year but is now expecting her second child with Boris Johnson. In a statement on Instagram, the PM's wife said they were expecting a brother or sister to their first child Wilfred due to arrive in the winter. Ruth Bender Atik, of the Miscarriage Association, said talking about pregnancy after losing a baby was important as it can be an anxious time for a couple. She added: ""It's vital we think about partners and remember their needs and ask them how they're doing."" And Zoe Clark-Coates, of the Mariposa Trust, a baby loss and bereavement charity, told the BBC: ""We see a massive influx of people asking for support if anybody of note, or even a TV show covers the story of baby loss in their shows, we see a real influx of people. ""When people of note talk about their own loss it gives a lot of people the confidence to start speaking about it — and sharing their own personal stories."" Baby charity Tommy's said: ""Baby loss at any stage in pregnancy is one of the most devastating things that can happen to any family – and as Carrie said, this heartbreak is endured frequently but often silently because of the taboo in society."" Boss Jane Brewin added: ""Our research estimates that 1 in 4 pregnancies ends in loss but it's shrouded in secrecy, stigma and shame; mothers like Carrie sharing their stories is a vital step in tackling that. ""Some bereaved parents choose to grieve privately, but they can still find comfort and connection in reading others' stories, and people like Carrie speaking out sends a powerful message: this may feel incredibly lonely, but you are not alone. Friends and family, doctors and midwives, all of us at support organisations like Tommy's, we're here."""
139,139,The Sun,Jacob Bentley-YorkHarry Cole,Tory backbench revolt over ‘complicated’ amber watchlist plans that could wreck summer holidays,"TORY backbenchers have blasted the government's ""inexplicably complicated"" plans to introduce an amber watchlist over fears they could ruin summer holidays. The scheme, which was agreed in principle this week, would see holidaymakers warned that while they are abroad certain amber countries could go straight on to the red list. Under current rules, tourists have to quarantine for ten days on their return to Britain — even if they are double jabbed. And if the country suddenly moves to a red list, travellers would face compulsory hotel quarantine on their return, at a cost of £1,750 a head. Spain could be one of the countries added to the list after experts previously cited that cases are looking ""worrying"" and ""bleak"". It would be likely to cause an exodus of up to a million British tourists who are on holiday there now. Furthermore, fears are also mounting that Italy and Greece could be included as well as they begin enforcing their own measures to curb the spread of the virus. It has promoted Tory backbenchers to pressure Boris Johnson and his government regarding any changes to the traffic light system that could leave the travel industry in jeopardy. Huw Merriman, the Tory Chairman of the Commons transport committee, said the proposal for an amber watchlist was a ""giant red flag"" that would cause bookings to collapse. ""The government has used the vaccine dividend to make some positives strides in the last few weeks, making it easier for those travelling in and out of the UK. ""This is not the time be adding further complexity, uncertainty and anxiety to an already beleaguered sector."" Ministers were set to meet on Thursday to review which countries Brits can safely visit, but a decision has now been delayed amid the government split. Chancellor Rishi Sunak reportedly told Boris Johnson that the UK's current border restrictions were ""out of step with our international competitors"". He warned that the curbs were having a damaging effect on jobs, amid mounting fears for the tourism and hospitality industries. A source told the Sunday Times: ""Rishi has called time on the travel restrictions."" Frustrated travel bosses also fear the PM risks is squandering our vaccine rollout with complex rules. The boss of trade body Airlines UK told The Sun that the Government was just ""tying itself in knots with inexplicably complicated rules."" Tim Alderslade said: ""We have totally squandered our vaccine dividend, no doubt to the amusement of the EU who have successfully opened up faster. ""This is the last chance saloon for the summer. Amber to most people is a glaring warning sign not to travel. ""Who would book a holiday knowing there's a fair chance you will have to self-isolate when you get back?"" It was announced last week that double jabbed EU and US citizens — and British expats — could avoid quarantine when they arrive in the UK. However, the bosses of BA, Virgin, easyJet, Ryanair, Jet2, LoganAir and TUI UK urged Transport Secretary Grant Shapps to expand the green list in a letter that warned: ""We cannot afford to stand still over this vital summer period. ""Expert Paul Charles, boss of The PC Agency, said: ""The traffic lights have failed because it is chaotic."" Currently, France is the only country's on the new ""amber plus"" category. The move meant France was excluded from the quarantine exemptions for fully vaccinated travellers - so holidaymakers have to isolate even if they are double jabbed. It resulted in a furious backlash from France and our own MPs who called it discriminatory and ""scientifically unfounded"". The Sun understands that the extra category for France is set for the axe within days — if Beta variant cases continue to fall there. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps insisted on Friday that the concerns over the Beta variant were based on cases in mainland France, not the tiny department of Reunion island in the Indian Ocean. He said it was right to continue with a ""cautious"" approach."

141,141,The Sun,Harry Cole,"Deliveroo, Uber and Bolt among firms lined up to offer discounts to jabbed students","FIRMS are lining up to give students incentives to get Covid-19 jabs — including discounts on pizzas and taxi rides. Uber confirmed yesterday it will offer them £10 off a journey or takeaways such as kebabs this autumn. Bosses of the ride-hailing and food delivery apps said any fresher who posed for a selfie outside a vaccination centre would receive the voucher treat. Rivals Bolt and Deliveroo, as well as restaurant Pizza Pilgrims, were among two dozen other big brands tonight in talks with the Government to offer similar incentives. Ministers are concerned that only 67 per cent of people aged 18 to 29 in England have received a first dose of a vaccine. They are trying to use a ""carrot and stick"" approach to encourage greater take-up — especially before university terms start next month. The students' return will spark fears of a new Covid wave. Two jabs will be compulsory to enter a nightclub from the autumn. However, early efforts to look at forcing all students to be double jabbed were ditched after a backlash. In the coming weeks, a number of other incentives will be rolled out to sit alongside the threat of banning unvaccinated younger adults from venues. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said yesterday: ""Thank you to all the businesses who are stepping up to support this important vaccine drive."" And he urged young people: ""Once available, please go out and take advantage of the discounts."" Jabs minister Nadhim Zahawi added: ""Thank you to the businesses who have backed this mission — please get your jabs as soon as you can and grab a bargain."" Uber said it was proud to be working with the Government on this ""important campaign to encourage everyone to get their jab"". It said it would send a push notification to millions of its users' mobile phones next week to remind them to get jabbed as soon as possible. Bolt was ""delighted"" to support the campaign, declaring: ""Get a Bolt, grab a jab, get living."" The taxi firm will offer free ride credit for people to get to a vaccination centre across university towns and cities after a similar £250,000 offer to London vaccination facilities this year. Pizza Pilgrims founder Thom Elliot said: ""By making getting your jab as easy as grabbing a pizza, hopefully we can help our teams and our customers get their first and second doses as easily and quickly as possible."" Opinion was split on the latest move, with some of the most outspoken critics of vaccine passports giving the plan a cautious welcome. Broadcaster and former politician Nigel Farage said: ""It's better than bullying us I suppose."" But Tory MP Steve Baker hit out, saying that it would be ""simpler just to pay them a straight fee"". And Tim Blake, professor of politics at London's Queen Mary's University described the scheme as a ""gimmick"". He said young people have a right to expect more than ""a handful of vouchers for rides and pizza"". He added: ""Gimmicks are great and the Government should get some credit for thinking outside the box. ""But what young people really need — and deserve — from the Government is a far-sighted and properly funded post–Covid recovery plan."" Yesterday — amid growing concerns that vaccine passports would be sneaked in by the back door over the long Parliamentary summer holiday — one politician even called for MPs to be recalled to Westminster. Andrew Bridgen is one of 43 Conservative MPs who have signed a declaration opposing vaccine passports. He warned that Prime Minister Boris Johnson would be heading for an ""embarrassing defeat"" if he pushed on with plans to ban unjabbed Brits from nightclubs and big events. Mr Bridgen, MP for North West Leicestershire, told LBC radio: ""I think if the Government is serious about the threat of bringing in domestic vaccine passports then, of course, Parliament should be recalled. ""This is a very serious infringement on people's liberties, it is basically unprecedented in this country, and I and a number of colleagues would oppose it."" He was tonight backed by Tory grandee Sir David Lidington who said a ""Government certificate of approval"" to access certain events would set a ""dangerous precedent""."
142,142,The Sun,Harry Cole,Shocking figures show cops charged just 7% of violent criminals last year,"FEWER than seven in 100 violent crimes saw anyone charged last year, damning data shows. That has plummeted from more than one in five suspected crimes heading to a courtroom just six years ago. Almost 1.67 million violent offences were reported to have taken place in the year to March 2021 but just 139,805 thugs faced the rap. In 238,000 of the crimes probed by cops, no suspect was even identified. Of 55,227 robberies reported, just 6,800 charges were brought, with no suspect identified in more than two thirds of cases. The Home Office stats for England and Wales out this week, detail charge rates for violent offences dived from 22 per cent in 2014/15 to just 6.8 per cent in 2020/21. Shockingly the charge rate for rape has hit just 1.5 per cent of those reported. Sarah Jones, shadow policing minister, said: ""Under Conservatives, criminals have never had it so good. ""It is shocking so many crimes don't even lead to a charge and victims of the most serious violent offences, like rape, are being denied justice. ""Labour would put victims first, boost community policing and bring criminals to justice."" The Home Office said the pandemic has ""significantly affected"" crime figures with a 13 per cent fall in total police recorded crime, excluding fraud. While theft stats plunged in lockdown, there was no reduction in violent crimes. But officials insist year-on-year comparisons have been made more ""challenging"" by the impact of Covid."

144,144,The Sun,Harry Cole,PM’s dog neutered to stop him humping as ‘romantic urges’ were out of control,"BORIS Johnson has had his randy dog Dilyn neutered to stop him humping legs. The Prime Minister admitted last week that the Jack Russell-cross's ""romantic urges"" were out of control. And now that vets' procedures are up and running post-lockdown, the terrier has got his comeuppance. Rescue dog Dilyn arrived at Downing Street in 2019, shortly after Mr Johnson and wife Carrie got the keys to No10. Since then, the so-called First Doggy has repeatedly hit the headlines for bad behaviour. He was accused of jumping on antique furniture and peeing in staff's handbags. The PM's former chief adviser Dominic Cummings is said to hold a grudge against Dilyn amid claims the dog tried to hump his leg at Chequers. This week the PM met German shepherd Zorro while visiting a police dog academy in Guildford, Surrey. Chatting with the dog's handlers, Mr Johnson asked: ""Do you have to worry about his romantic urges?"" After being told Zorro was a good boy, the PM shook his head and chuckled: ""My dog is endless…. on people's legs."""
145,145,The Sun,Harry Cole,Keir Starmer accused of having ‘more positions than Kama Sutra’ after Covid U-turns,"FLIP-flopping Sir Keir Starmer was accused of having ""more positions than the Kama Sutra"" as he called for an early end to the pingdemic. Forced isolation will no longer apply for the double-jabbed from August 16, but the Labour leader has now demanded it be brought forward to August 7. His plea yesterday came just weeks after he opposed lifting lockdown rules and scrapping masks — and his blasting of the relaxation of travel restrictions. Tory party chairwoman Amanda Milling compared Sir Keir to a weather vane as well as the ancient sex manual, saying: ""He points different ways depending on which day it is, changing position more often than the Kama Sutra to chase headlines and play politics."" Labour had said the latest border rules were ""reckless"" and that Boris Johnson was opening up the UK too fast. However, wobbly Sir Keir now says bringing forward the self-isolation exemption date for the fully vaccinated would make a ""huge difference"" to businesses and holidaymakers. He points different ways depending on which day it is, changing position more often than the Kama Sutra. The Labour chief's U-turn came after he said in March that vaccine passports would be ""un-British"" — only to say last week they made sense. He also previously criticised calls for the NHS app to be altered to stop so many people being ""pinged"" after contact with a Covid sufferer. In his latest about-face yesterday, Sir Keir urged the PM to follow Labour's lead in Wales after its First Minister Mark Drakeford confirmed August 7 as the day when double-jabbed adults can escape isolation. Scotland is expected to remove the need for fully vaccinated people to isolate on August 9. But Mr Johnson has insisted England is ""nailed on"" not to make the same move until August 16. Sir Keir said: ""There is a huge difference between these dates. In that nine-day difference, there are hundreds of thousands of working days that will not be lost. ""There are businesses that won't have the chaos they are facing at the moment. ""And lots of people who are planning to go on holiday will have the peace of mind they can actually go."""
146,146,The Sun,Harry Cole,Britain will likely slap a political boycott on the Winter Olympics in China,"BRITAIN will likely slap a political boycott on the Winter Olympics in China, The Sun can reveal. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced yesterday he will shun the Beijing games next year as pressure mounts for a full ministerial and royal no show. UK athletes will compete but its becoming increasingly likely the Government will stage a protest snubbing. Diplomatic relations with the Communist superpower are in the freezer over human rights abuses, Hong Kong and Covid lies. Anti-China MPs do not want the UK to send any political representation to the games games year like the 2018 Russia World Cup boycott. And last night a senor Government source said it was now very unlikely any minister would attend the 2022 event. The said it is ""increasingly hard to justify the idea of ministers swanning off to watch sport in a country where you know terrible and awful things are happening just down the road."" The United States is consulting allies on a ""shared approach"" to the Winter Olympic amid global criticism of China's human rights abuses. When asked if he would attend, Mr Raab told Sky News: ""I doubt it."" ""I think it would be very unlikely that I would go,"" he added."
147,147,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Boris Johnson shoots down Home Office plans that could see journalists and whistleblowers jailed for 14 years over leaks,"BORIS Johnson has shot down planned changes to the Official Secrets Act that could jail journalists for 14 years for exposing public interest stories. After a massive backlash to a suggested Home Office clampdown that would treat newspapers like spies, the PM mounted a passionate defence of Britain's free Press. And he vowed to protect it as ""​​a search light that will continue to shine on every crevice."" In the wake of the Matt Hancock scandal the PM offered his full throated defence of whistleblowing that has produced ""the best and most important stories."" Mr Johnson's comments came amid alarm that a review of the Official Secrets Act could curtail reporting like The Sun's expose of the Health Secretary's lockdown breaking affair. Fears have been raised that a Home Office consultation into updating the 1989 Act could lead to reporters who are given leaked documents or information being treated similarly to hostile intelligence agents. Journalists could face jail sentences of up to 14 years under planned changes that could criminalise the Press for upsetting the current and future governments. But in an interview with LBC radio, Boris Johnson said he did not think ""for one minute"" that the alterations, designed to account for shifting threats in the digital age, would be allowed to prevent journalists from carrying out investigations. The former journalist said: ""We don't - I don't - want to have a world in which people are prosecuted for doing what they think is their public duty and... in the public interest. ""I'm full of admiration for the way journalists generally conduct themselves. ""Whatever this thing is, I don't for one minute think it is going to interrupt the normal process."" And he insisted: ""The best and most important stories, whether they're Watergate or Thalidomide or whatever come from tainted sources. ""One man's, you know, treacherous betrayer of confidences and irresponsible leaker is another man's whistleblower."" And he vowed: ""What we want to do is make sure that we don't do anything to interrupt the operation of good journalism and bringing you new and important facts into the public domain."" But, asked whether the consultation on the Official Secrets Act should be ""ripped up"", Mr Johnson suggested the review of the feedback should continue but sources today gave strong hints the contentious parts will be dropped or tweaked to allow a public interest defence. Asked whether there would be a public interest defence being included in the updated Act, Mr Johnson's spokesman said last week: ""It is a consultation so it is important we allow that to run its course and we study the responses closely before we set out any more details in due course."""
148,148,The Sun,Harry ColeSam BlanchardNiamh Cavanagh,"Britain HAS reached herd immunity, minster says as Covid cases fall for SEVENTH day in a row","BRITAIN has reached herd immunity, a minister has claimed - as Covid cases fell for the seventh day in a row. Hopes the Covid pandemic is finally beginning to end in the UK have emerged as the infection rate appears to have slowed, with deaths remaining comparatively low. And a top expert whose grim predictions on deaths led to the first lockdown believes the country will be past the pandemic by the autumn. Herd immunity refers to where enough people in a population have immunity to infection to be able to effectively stop that disease from spreading. Despite Boris Johnson warning against ""running away"" with ""premature conclusions"", one senior minister said the jabs roll-out - along with 5.72million positive tests in Britain - means the virus will struggle to spread. Speaking to the Mail Online, the Government official said: ""It is all over bar the shouting, but no one has noticed. ""Of course, we have to guard against the emergence of some terrible new variant. ""But otherwise Covid is on the point of becoming something you live with. ""It drops into the background, but it does not change anything terribly – maybe you have to take a test once in a while."" There were just 23,511 cases reported yesterday — half the nearly 47,000 reported a week ago — despite Tuesdays often seeing spikes in numbers because of the weekend lag in reporting. Deaths jumped to 131, the highest daily total since March, but the figure is nowhere near the levels seen in previous waves as vaccines continue to blunt Covid's power. ""Professor Lockdown"" Neil Ferguson — who just days ago predicted there could soon be 200,000 cases a day — declared the crisis would be over by the autumn. The government adviser and virus expert at Imperial College London said he was positive the worst of the pandemic would be over within months. He said: ""The effect of vaccines has been huge in reducing the risk of hospitalisation and death and I'm positive that, by late September-October time, we will be looking back at most of the pandemic. ""We'll still have Covid with us, we'll still have people dying from Covid, but we'll put the bulk of the pandemic behind us."" He said the spike in July, which saw infections rise to 55,000 in a day, could have been caused by Euros football parties. It might have dropped because people went out in sunny weather and schools started to close. He added: ""I think we'll see a clear plateau emerge later this week. The real issue is will that turn into a long-term decline . . . or will we see a resurgence of hospitalisations and deaths as we go later into summer and autumn?"" His concern was echoed by the PM who told reporters in Surrey that people must still take care. He said: ""Step 4 of the opening up only took place a few days ago. People have got to remain very cautious. That remains the Government's approach."" There is a concern in Whitehall that the seven-day drop may reflect the fading effect of indoor mixing to watch the Euros and that the virus could still be spreading. One source said: ""We need more data to know if this is just the football spike normalising, or things really are in retreat."" On the rising deaths, Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said rates were still high. She said: ""The pandemic is not over yet . . . we are still in the third wave."" She said yesterday's figure reflected, in part, the high number of cases recorded in recent weeks. She said: ""We know deaths follow when there are a high number of cases."" Meanwhile, the Test and Trace ""pingdemic"" continued to blight workplaces. Mr Johnson repeated that the double jabbed will be able to swerve isolation by mid-August after ministers publicly cast doubt on that date. He said: ""I know that people have been frustrated about the pinging and the self-isolation . . .  particularly now as we're starting to see some better figures. ""But I think everybody understands that this is still a very dangerous disease. We do need to use the tools that we have. ""Self-isolation is the one that we've got. But don't forget, folks, that we're coming forward with the new system from August 16. ""We'll come forward with the test-to-release approach then."" Earlier, Policing Minister Kit Malthouse said the government would have to wait and ""see what's happening on the numbers"" before confirming the relaxation. He said: ""Let's all hope the numbers go well. People will be assessing in the week before what the numbers look like and then taking a decision nearer the time."""
149,149,The Sun,Harry Cole,Michael Gove blasts ‘selfish’ Brits who refuse the Covid vaccine and says they should be banned from big events,"BRITS who refuse the Covid vaccine are ""selfish"" and deserve to be banned from big events like the Premier League, Michael Gove blasted last night. In the most direct assault on adults who have so far not taken up an offer of a jab, the Cabinet Office minister hit out: ""Ultimately, if you can be vaccinated and you refuse to, that is a selfish act."" Speaking on a visit to a virus testing lab in Glasgow, he added: ""You're putting other people's health and lives at risk, you should get vaccinated."" And he added ""some form of certification is the right way to go"" to prove if you have been jabbed. Mr Gove warned: ""If you deliberately refuse to get vaccinated and there are certain venues and certain events that require a certain level of safety, then, you know, the terms in which you will be able to get into those venues and those events will be barred to you."" Ministers are considering whether to make Covid passports compulsory for football stadiums and larger venues, as well as night clubs. Probed on the state of those talks, Mr Gove said: ""I think we do have to have some way of making sure that for certain venues and certain events, that people can be confident that those who are attending those events are less likely to be carriers of the virus."" And citing football specifically, he added: ""Ultimately, we all want to make sure that major activities, Premier League games, other major activities, are safe."" Last night the boss of the Tory backbencher anti-lockdown Covid Recovery Group hammered Mr Gove's comments, accusing him for forcing mandatory jabs through the back door. Ex-Cabinet Minister Mark Harper said: ""I strongly support vaccination, have been double jabbed and would recommend others do likewise. I do not support compulsory vaccination or measures dressed up to achieve that result - like domestic vaccine passports."" Mr Gove's comments about football came as Tottenham announced they will trial the use of the NHS Covid Pass for fans who want to attend friendlies against Arsenal next month. Attendees will have to show official proof through the NHS app that they are double jabbed, or have had a negative test within 48 hours."
150,150,The Sun,Harry Cole,"Boris Johnson will gift 800,000 doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid jab to Kenya","BORIS Johnson will today hand 800,000 doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab to Kenya, The Sun can reveal. The UK's key ally in the East Africa has currently only vaccinated about 2 per cent of its population so far. Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta flew into London last night with the pair due to meet at Chequers this afternoon where they will announce the life-saving gift. The AZ jabs are make up the first tranche of 100 million doses the UK vowed to share with poorer countries at June's G7 through the global Covax programme. It's understood other countries set to received doses from Britain will be unveiled in the coming weeks, with Mr Johnson promising the UK will donate 5 million doses by the end of September. The UK helped to establish the international Covax jab effort last year and is its fourth-biggest donor, pledging £548 million to the scheme. Last night a senior government source said: ""It's right that as the UK continues our world-beating vaccine rollout at home, we support other countries to get the pandemic under control. ""No one is safe from this virus until we're all safe."""
151,151,The Sun,Harry Cole,Burglars and thieves to be electronically tagged 24 hours a day to stop them reoffending,"BURGLARS and thieves will be electronically tagged 24 hours a day to stop them reoffending in an anti crime blitz. Boris Johnson is also announcing a huge boost to stop and search powers to tackle the deadly knife crime epidemic. While criminals will be put to work cleaning up streets, estates and parks in a ""visible"" push for the public to ""see justice being done"". Lags convicted of booze related crimes - which the Home Office says drives 39 per cent of all violent crime - will also be tagged to stop them drinking. The massive law and order crackdown comes after a torrid few weeks of negative headlines has seen the PM's approval ratings sink. But after 10 days in isolation at Chequers, Mr Johnson is hoping to use a week focused on tackling crime to turn the page and get back onto the front foot. He will appear with Home Secretary Priti Patel this morning for a visit. Announcing the massive crime crackdown, the PM said: ""When I first stood on the steps of Downing Street as Prime Minister, I promised to back the police and make people safer, because we cannot level up the country when crime hits the poorest hardest and draws the most vulnerable into violence. ""That is why my Government has remained unstinting in its efforts to protect the British public and this plan delivers a fresh commitment, as we emerge from the impacts of the pandemic, to have less crime, fewer victims and a safer society."" The flagship measure will be a permanent uplift for sweeping powers for the police to Stop and Search suspected criminals to drive down soaring knife crime. So called Section 60 powers allow police to dramatically increase their Stop and Search tactics in areas where they anticipate violence - or following a stabbing to help find weapons and stop reprisals. The move consigns Theresa May's legacy to the dustbin of history. As both Home Secretary and PM, she battled against Stop and Search suggesting it was discriminatory and capping its use. But within days of taking over in 2019, Mr Johnson began unpicking that. Pilots have been running since then to allow all 43 police forces to use Stop and Search powers more often - and that will now be put on a permanent footing. MEASURES in the crime crackdown include: Home Office sources say the test schemes had led to officers having more confidence using Stop and Search and a knock on deterrent effect to would-be offenders. Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ""We're putting 20,000 new police officers on the street, equipping them with new powers to catch criminals and take away knives."" But Labour branded the Beating Crime Plan ""all talk and no action when it comes to tackling crime."""
152,152,The Sun,Harry ColeTariq Tahir,"Binmen, soldiers and prison workers added to list of key workers exempt from self isolation in bid to ease pingdemic","BINMEN, soldiers and prison workers are to be added to the list of key workers exempt from NHS test and trace isolation. The move is aimed at keeping key public services running during the crippling pingdemic, which has seen piles of rubbish building up as binmen are forced to quarantine. A million people were pinged by the NHS Covid app in just one week with pubs, factories, hospitals and airports being forced to shut because of mass staff isolations. Fears of 1970s style scenes of garbage piled high on Britain's streets mean binmen are now set to be included in the isolation swerving scheme. It comes as Boris Johnson pleaded with Brits not to go wild last night despite Covid cases plunging for a SIXTH consecutive day. But a staggering two million Brits are thought to be stuck at home and there have been fears food supplies could be affected as supermarkets battle staff shortages. Under new government plans those on the exempt list will now be given daily tests instead of having to isolate after coming into contact with a Covid victim. Telecoms, pharmaceutical and prison staff will join binmen on the pingdemic exemption list. Defence workers and power plant staff will also be able to dodge isolating. The government has added 1200 new workplace sites that will carry out testing, taking the total to 2000. But there there has been fresh blow for the battered hospitality industry which is set to miss out again, prolonging the uncertainty for pubs and restaurants. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""Whether it's prison guards reporting for duty, waste collectors keeping our streets clean or workers in our energy sector keeping the lights on, critical workers have been there for us at every stage of this global pandemic."" And Defence Secretary Ben Wallace added: ""Our Armed Forces have worked tirelessly throughout this pandemic, ensuring operations and training at home and abroad continue while at the same time providing round the clock support to the nation's response to Covid. ""Expanding the daily contact testing scheme is hugely welcome, allowing our personnel to continue that vital work across the UK and abroad. Covid data shows 24,950 lab-confirmed cases in the UK in the previous day and 28 deaths. That's almost half the 48,161 recorded a week ago on July 18. Mr Johnson's spokesman said the fall in coronavirus cases was ""encouraging"" but numbers were still expected to rise. He said: ""Throughout the pandemic we have always said it's encouraging when cases are falling."" But he also said the pandemic ""is not over"", and ""we should still expect to see a rise in case numbers given the move to Step 4 last week"". The spokesman added: ""The Prime Minister thinks we're not out of the woods yet."" In a bid to keep the country functioning, Whitehall departments have been encouraging different sectors to come forward with the roles they think ought to be added. Ministers rolled out exemptions last week amid warnings the country is on the brink of starting to run out of food. Workplace testing sites were announced for the food industry, transport workers, Border Force staff, frontline police and fire services. Public transport has also been badly hit with train, bus, and Underground services all being cancelled due to worker shortages. But militant union bosses are threatening to derail plans to get the country back on its feet again. They're threatening to launch strike action over the Government's plans, claiming they could put members at risk."
153,153,The Sun,Harry Cole,Data watchdog chief ‘passionate’ about whistle-blowers despite raids to catch sources for The Sun’s Matt Hancock story,"DATA watchdog chief Elizabeth Denman has said she is ""passionate"" about whistle-blowers — days after launching raids to catch sources for The Sun's Matt Hancock story. The Information Commissioner triggered a furious backlash from campaigners, politicians and the Press for seizing computers in two homes last week. They were looking for the source of leaked CCTV footage showing the disgraced Health Secretary canoodling in his office with an aide at the height of lockdown. But yesterday Denman was forced to issue a statement attempting to justify her heavy-handed response - claiming she loves journalists. She insisted she had a ""statutory responsibility"" to investigate reports of a data breach ""administering the laws that Parliament has given us"". But she claimed: ""I'm also passionate about free journalism, the importance of an independent press and I'm also passionate about whistleblowers."" ""But whistleblowers and the public interest turns on us establishing the facts in this case, so it's important that we go in and we look at the facts and only then will we make a determination as to whether this data breach was in the public interest. ""You know, from the other side of the equation, there is a lot of concern in the security community and among the public that their personal information collected on CCTV is used for security purposes. ""On the one hand, we have the security stakeholders saying, 'Get in there and investigate' and on the other side people somehow think we're investigating The Sun or journalists and we are not, we're looking at whether or not there was a contravention of the law, the data protection law."" The ICO said at the time of the raids that Emcor Group, which provides CCTV services at the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), submitted a breach report alleging the images were taken from the system without consent. According to the regulator, the alleged breach falls under Section 170 of the Data Protection Act 2018, which does include a ""public interest"" defence under certain circumstances. Ms Denham also said she would not be seeking information from The Sun, after our editor-in-chief Victoria Newton said she would rather go to jail than reveal the names of their informants."
154,154,The Sun,Harry Cole,Planned national insurance hike to pay for social care opens split in Cabinet,"PLANS to hike national insurance contributions to pay for social care have opened a split in the Cabinet. Kwasi Kwarteng claimed the move would break the Tories' election manifesto pledge. The Business Secretary spoke out as anger erupted over the mooted £10billion raid on wages to pay for elderly care costs and to help clear the NHS backlog. Mr Kwarteng said that he believes a social care plan will come ""by the autumn"". But he added: ""I don't see how we could increase National Insurance. ""Yet his comments were slapped down by No 10. Boris Johnson's spokesman said: ""The PM has been clear we will set out details later this year and that no decisions have been made."" The Government was also on the backfoot after claims an NICs rise could be used to fund the three per cent pay rise for nurses. Furious nurses said the rise was not enough and did not rule out striking. Other public sector staff, such as teachers and police, will see only their lowest-paid get a boost in wages, putting ministers at war with most of the public sector. Downing Street insisted that ""it will not impact funding already marked for the NHS frontline"". But it could not say where the cash for the uplift could come from. Pat Cullen, from the Royal College of Nursing, said: ""This pay announcement is fast unravelling. ""Not only is the figure scandalously low but Downing Street has been forced to admit the money isn't new. ""It is brutally unfair to force the NHS to do yet more with the same money. ""The union will poll members to see if they will strike. The Police Federation said it no longer had confidence in the Home Secretary after it was revealed officers will not get a salary rise next year."
155,155,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson shelves fixing social care until autumn — after leaked plans to hike National Insurance were panned,"THE Prime Minister yesterday shelved fixing social care until the autumn — after leaked plans to hike National Insurance were panned across the board. Both left and right exploded in anger following The Sun's revelation that Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak were close to agreeing a multi-billion pound raid. Tory MPs were livid that manifesto commitments not to hike taxes are on the cusp of being ripped up. One raged: ""It seems if Boris can't ban something he wants to tax it."" The lefty Resolution Foundation said the idea would hit the young disproportionately. They said: ""It asks younger and lower-paid workers to contribute more than older and wealthier people, compared to a fairer rise in income tax."" Meanwhile the Taxpayers' Alliance branded a one per cent NI hike ""smoke and mirrors"" that would punish workers and businesses alike. And the right-of-centre Institute of Economic Affairs called it an income tax rise by the back door. Mike Cherry, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ""After the huge amount of damage wrought to businesses over the last 16 months, the Government cannot be serious about a strong economic recovery if it thinks hiking the jobs tax is a good idea."" Yesterday Downing Street declined to deny The Sun's story that a rise was coming. The PM's spokesman said: ""The process for agreeing our proposals is still ongoing. We will set that out before the end of the year."" Mr Johnson had hoped to reveal his plans this week, but ditched that after being forced into isolation in a Whitehall Covid outbreak. Sources say he will return to the issue after the summer break, despite promising to fix the blackhole in elderly care provision funding two years ago."
156,156,The Sun,Harry ColeNicholas Gutteridge,EU demands Spanish border guards be posted at Gibraltar’s port and airport,"A FRESH battle with Brussels has exploded after EU officials demanded Spanish boots on Gibraltar. They want their border guards posted at The Rock's port and airport. And an incendiary document also proposed their police have the right to enter the territory unannounced if chasing a criminal. Uniformed officers could enforce EU rules and Spanish taxes without the people of Gibraltar having a say. Britain and Madrid were in the process of negotiating how the border between the tiny UK overseas territory on the southern tip of Spain will work in practice after Brexit. But Brussels weighed in with a fresh blueprint. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab declared it dead on arrival and accused the EU of seeking to ""undermine the UK's sovereignty of Gibraltar"". He claimed they were trying to blow up the talks. Mr Raab added: ""We have consistently showed pragmatism and flexibility in the search for arrangements that work for all sides. We urge the EU to think again."" A senior UK Government source went even further by saying: ""Instead of allowing the UK and Spain to sort this, the EU is proposing Spanish boots on Gibraltar."" The Rock's chief minister Fabian Picardo said: ""There is no possibility of this forming the basis for an agreement."""
157,157,The Sun,Harry ColeSam BlanchardDan Jones,Brits will be REFUSED entry into clubs from September unless they can show proof of two Covid jabs,"CLUBBERS will have to show proof of two Covid jabs to get into venues from September, Boris Johnson said last night. The shock announcement came after ministers had previously ruled out ""papers to party"" and insisted any such scheme would be voluntary for nightclubs. But concerns under-30s are not taking up the vaccine quickly enough sparked a U-turn on Covid passports — intended as an incentive for the young to get jabbed. More than three million 18 to 30- year-olds have yet to take up the offer of a first jab — prompting the PM to fire his ""policy bazooka"". Mr Johnson even left the door open to extending the move to pubs and football clubs saying he ""reserved the right to do what's necessary to protect the public"". One senior government source said: ""Other countries have seen rapid take-up of the jabs once the incentive is there for young people to get one. It is clear the carrot hasn't been working, so I'm afraid it is time for the stick."" But last night, the nightclub industry blasted the move. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, described the plans as an ""absolute shambles"". He said: ""So, 'freedom day' for nightclubs lasted around 17 hours then. The announcement from the Prime Minister that Covid passports will be made mandatory for nightclubs in September comes after his health secretary said only one week ago that they would not be compulsory. What an absolute shambles."" The PM yesterday appealed directly to under-30s to do their bit and get their jabs. He said: ""Come on folks, this is it, you won't regret it. It's the right thing to do for you, for your family and for everybody out there. Above all, it's the right thing for you to help get back the freedoms you love."" Speaking from Chequers where he has been forced to isolate for ten days, the PM added: ""We're concerned, as they are in other countries, by the continuing risk posed by nightclubs. ""I should serve notice now that by the end of September, when all over-18s will have had their chance to be double jabbed, we're planning to make full vaccination the condition of entry to nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather. ""Proof of a negative test will no longer be enough. I don't want to have to close nightclubs again as they have elsewhere, but it does mean nightclubs need to do the socially responsible thing and make use of the NHS Covid pass."" Asked by The Sun if this policy was the ""thin edge of the wedge"" and ""passports for pints"" would soon be coming in, the PM did not rule it out. He said: ""I certainly don't want to see passports for pubs. But where the settings are closed, crowded and close social contact, we reserve the right to do what's necessary to protect the public."" Mr Johnson was also pushed on whether large gatherings for mandatory Covid jabs could include football stadiums next season, but he dodged the question. He later said he wanted to ""avoid a situation where people are asked to produce papers"" but again repeated he reserved the right to ""do what's necessary"". Chief Medical Officer Sir Patrick Vallance added: ""Nightclubs and venues where you've got lots of people indoors crowded together are a focus for potential super-spreading events. ""That's why it's so important everybody gets a vaccine so we can reduce the chance of spread and consequences of that spread."" NHS England figures show a third of 18 to 29-year-olds have not yet had their first dose, with men more likely than women not to have come forward. Last night Peter Marks, boss of Rekom UK which runs 47 of the UK's biggest clubs such as Pryzm and Atik, said: ""The people making these decisions have this outdated idea of what nightclubs were like in the 1980s and 1990s. ""We have the best air purification around. We change our air every four minutes for fresh air from outside. No other venues, pubs and so on, can compete with that. So why are nightclubs being targeted?"""
158,158,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Boris and Rishi eye National Insurance hike to pay for Social Care – smashing Tory manifesto promise,"BORIS Johnson and Rishi Sunak are close to agreeing to hike National Insurance Contributions by at least one per cent to raise billions to pay for social care, The Sun can reveal. The planned new Health Tax is modelled on Gordon Brown's 2002 NICs raid - that the Tories dubbed at the time a ""tax on ordinary people"". The then Labour chancellor was accused of breaking election promises not to raise income tax by hiking national insurance to boost NHS spending. Senior sources say the PM and Chancellor were ""almost there"" at crunch talks on Friday aimed at filling a £7 Billion funding shortfall. But plans to announce the package later this week were plunged into chaos after the pair were forced into isolation when Health Secretary Sajid Javid got Covid. One Downing Street source said: ""It's going to be controversial and you can't really do much when the three salesmen pitching this to the country are locked up."" Voters and MPs have been crying out for a solution to the funding crisis, as thousands of people face crippling costs in old age. But such a move would smash the Conservatives manifesto commitment not to raise NICs, VAT or income tax in this parliament. However government sources say no other taxes are broad enough to raise money quickly to fill the blackhole in Britain's elderly care provision and the 2019 manifesto has been eclipsed by the pandemic. NICs are currently the Treasury's second-biggest revenue raiser, bringing in more than £150 billion in 2021/22 – accounting for one in five pounds raised in taxation. The tax is levied on the earnings of all individuals aged 16 or over and their employer. Most contribute around 12 per cent on their weekly earnings up to £967. A further 2 per cent is paid by the rich with any earnings above £967, with the self employed paying a lower rate. But using a hike to pay for social care risks a major row as over 67s do not pay it even if they are still in work - despite older people being the ones that will need the care soonest. Senior figures involved in the discussions say it would be pitched as an insurance option for younger people against bigger bills later in life, but did not dispute the fact the Tory manifesto ""tax lock"" is hanging by a thread. Last night The Sun probed the PM directly on whether his manifesto commitment not to raise National Insurance still stood. And Mr Johnson refused to answer. He simply said: ""On the long awaited plans to deal with social care and how to how to cover all that, a problem that has bedevilled governments for at least three decades... You've just got to wait a little bit longer. ""I'm sorry about that, but it won't be too long, it won't be too long now, I assure you.""

159,159,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson could unveil a new tax raid to pay for social care within days,"BORIS Johnson could unveil a new tax raid to pay for social care within days. Last night there were mounting suggestions in Whitehall that the PM would unveil his long awaited plans to fix the blackhole in care for the elderly next week. He has been locked in talks with Chancellor Rishi Sunak and new Health Secretary Sajid Javid after vowing to fix the problem when he took office two years ago next Friday. It was reported this week that Mr Johnson had softened his opposition to a new tax to take the burden on paying to help the aged from their struggling families. And it's thought a cap on what families will have to pay for care will be introduced. However any new tax is likely to be politically toxic for the government given the Tories were elected in 2019 on the back of a promise not to put up income taxes. Yesterday health minister Lord Bethell said ""details are emerging"" of Mr social care reforms, that would provide ""affordable, high quality and sustainable"" system. Sources said last night the outlines of the plan could be published ahead of Mr Johnson's second anniversary in power next week. Yesterday Downing Street did not deny reports that Mr Johnson is backing a new tax to pay for social care reforms or that a cap on payments could form part of his plans."
160,160,The Sun,Harry ColeRob PattinsonJonathan Reilly,Matt Hancock: Fury as homes raided in hunt for affair whistle-blowers after CCTV video leak despite YOUR right to know,"BRITAIN'S data watchdog was hit by a furious backlash last night after they raided homes in their hunt for the Matt Hancock scandal whistle-blowers. The former Health Secretary quit after The Sun last month revealed CCTV of his office clinch with aide Gina Coladangelo, which broke lockdown rules. Yesterday the Information Commissioner's Office seized computers and other devices after searching two properties in the south of England. But their ""overkill"" probe was branded a menace to the free Press by MPs, campaigners and the public — who said the tipsters should be ""given a medal"". The Information Commissioner's Office was accused of behaving like the East German Stasi. Plasterer Craig Wells said: ""The whistleblowers should be getting medals for this."" There were also fears the raids may act as a deterrent to other whistle-blowers — leaving other scandals uncovered as a result. In a bombshell front-page last month, The Sun revealed CCTV images of married Mr Hancock's steamy office clinch with aide Gina Coladangelo that broke his own lockdown rules — which triggered his resignation. A concerned whistle-blower passed us footage of the affair — with the UK's most senior lawyer declaring our revelation was squarely in the public interest. While fighting to survive, Mr Hancock's allies tried to claim the cheating Tory had been targeted by Russian or Chinese spies, or a bug was planted in his office. Now the leak is subject to an ICO investigation under the Data Protection Act — with the quango relying on little-used powers to conduct their raids yesterday. But the body was hit by a massive backlash last night, with politicians, campaigners and voters in Mr Hancock's constituency accusing it of a massive overreaction. Labour's Shadow Security Minister Conor McGinn hit out: ""This story was clearly in the public interest. Any illegality must be investigated but we need to ensure that whistle-blowers can continue to play their vital part in the keeping organisations accountable."" Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said: ""The Sun were right to publish these photos, they were clearly in the public interest. The Sun is also absolutely right to protect its sources."" Tory Julian Knight, boss of the powerful Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee said: ""I can't comment on an investigation in progress but freedom of the Press and their ability where necessary to act in the public interest is a cornerstone of our democracy and we endanger it at our peril."" Sam Armstrong, of think tank the Henry Jackson Society, said: ""If a national security leak has indeed been ruled out by police, this is nothing more than a heavy-handed attempt by a bureaucratic agency to intimidate the source of a story in the public interest."" Jim Killock, executive director of Open Rights Group, which campaigns to protect our rights to privacy and free speech, said: ""This is a drastic step by the ICO to intervene in this case which has such obvious public interest."" Mick Hume, a free speech campaigner, added: ""The UK's 'data watchdog' is acting more like a Stasi police dog, launching morning raids on people's homes and impounding personal computers in its desperation to hunt down the whistle-blower."" ""The Sun's exposure of the arrogant double-standards of a government minister, who thought strict rules he imposed on others did not apply to him, is in the best tradition of public interest journalism."" Last night there was growing disquiet within government over the ICO's heavy-handed tactics. One Whitehall figure added: ""You really have to question whether a quango which spends most of its time fielding complaints about nuisance marketing calls should have the power to kick down doors as if they're breaking up a major drug smuggling ring"" Another said: ""They think they're the FBI when they're more like the IT Crowd."" In Mr Hancock's West Suffolk constituency, plasterer Mr Wells said: ""We're meant to live in a free society, this is the kind of move you'd expect from a government in China or North Korea. Hancock is not popular round here. This latest move won't do him any favours."" Nigel Underwood, 60, added: ""When I read that story, I was really pleased he'd been caught out as the hypocrisy was shocking. But straight away I thought, 'I bet that they'll go after the whistle-blowers'. ""It's typical of a government under fire — it's a classic deflection tactic, they should be ashamed. The whistle-blowers should be given a medal, not persecuted."" West Suffolk Tory councillor Ian Houlder said: ""Why don't they put so much effort into questioning Matt Hancock on the other breaches he's probably made over the past few months? Hancock let the people of his constituency down badly — but now they seem to be more interested in a witch-hunt to find whoever leaked the evidence. ""This search for a whistle-blower is total overkill —- that isn't what is important."" ICO director of investigations Steve Eckersley said: ""We have an ongoing investigation into criminal matters and will not be commenting further until it is concluded."" THE Information Commissioner's Office acts as Britain's data watchdog. It was set up to ensure that the personal details we all hand over to the Government and businesses are kept responsibly. The ICO polices the Data Protection Act and is also the gatekeepers to information accessed via the Freedom of Information Act. Earlier this year it was handed new enforcement powers — along with the ability to conduct raids, carry out financial investigations and probe online security. Its boss, civil servant and Canadian citizen Elizabeth Denham, came under fire during the pandemic for working from home — in British Columbia, Canada."
161,161,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson wants to create county ‘sheriffs’ with the same powers as big city mayors,"BORIS Johnson wants to create county ""sheriffs"" with the same powers as big city mayors. The PM suggested these local leaders could have control over policing, travel and planning as part of his ""Levelling Up"" agenda. The former Mayor of London offered scant detail yesterday of how his plan would work in unveiling proposals that would take powers from Westminster. He even asked in his speech in Coventry for punters to email him with a name for the new politicians — with social media quick to brand them sheriffs. But the PM told the UK Battery Industrialisation Centre it was time to ""rewrite the rule book"" and to take a ""more flexible approach to devolution"" in England. He said towns should get ""the tools to make things happen for their communities"". And Mr Johnson argued: ""There is no reason why our great counties cannot benefit from the same powers we've devolved to city leaders."" But he cautioned it could yet come back to haunt the Tories if left-wing and Labour leaders seized control. The PM got into hot water last year for branding devolution to Scotland a ""disaster"" and has had battles with Labour mayors such as Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham on Covid. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called the ideas ""all soundbites and no substance"". Mr Johnson also took aim at Dominic Cummings. He vowed to stick to his goal of rebalancing Britain, after the ex-No10 aide called the PM a ""shopping trolley"" veering in different directions. Mr Cummings wrote on his blog the speech was a ""joke""."

Relatives of those slain in the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings slammed plans to call time on Troubles- related prosecutions. British troops and spies — and IRA terrorists — will be granted clemency in a bid to shut down the witch-hunt against veterans. But Julie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine was among 21 people killed in the Birmingham blasts and represents their families, said: ""If one of your loved ones was blown up beyond recognition, where you were only able to identify your son or daughter by their fingernails because their face had been burned so severely from the blast, would you be so quick to agree to such obscene legislation being implemented?"" Speaking for the Justice 4 The 21 campaign group, she added: ""You would do everything in your power to find the murderers and bring them to justice — which is exactly what we campaign for every day."" And Ulster Human Rights Watch slammed the proposals as a ""betrayal to victims and former police and military veterans"". Spokesman Axel Schmidt described the Government's position as a ""sorry mess"" and an ""affront to men and women who wore a uniform to counter gangs of terrorist murderers"". But Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said it was ""the best and only way to help Northern Ireland move further along the road to reconciliation"". Boris Johnson added that it was a way for the Province to ""draw a line under the Troubles"""
163,163,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson blasts Tory critics who think he’s too focused on Red Wall seats he won in 2019,"BORIS Johnson will today confront those Tory critics who believe he is too focused on the North. The Prime Minister will try to cool tempers within his party amid claims he cares only about the Red Wall seats he won in 2019. In the wake of last month's by-election defeat in a southern Tory stronghold, Mr Johnson will launch a passionate defence of his ""levelling up"" agenda. It comes as there are calls from his own MPs not to forget more traditional Conservative areas down South. And there was new pressure on the PM last night after polling showed his government was hit by its worst ratings since last October. But today he will vow to plough on pumping cash into ""left behind"" areas, adding: ""It is vital to understand the difference between this project and levelling down. ""We don't want to decapitate the tall poppies. You can't make the poor parts of the country richer by making the rich parts poorer. ""Levelling up is not a jam-spreading operation."" Mr Johnson insisted that plans to spend more in the North were ""not robbing Peter to pay Paul — it's not zero sum, it's win win"". Last month, the Lib Dems seized Chesham and Amersham in Bucks — a Tory seat since 1974 — amid rows over planning rules and the HS2 rail route that carves through the constituency. But Mr Johnson will insist that big building plans and travel projects to tilt the economic growth away from the ""overheating"" South will help all parts of the country. He will point to ""areas where house prices are sky high and where transport is already congested"". And he will blame his predecessors for putting too much focus there. On a visit to the West Midlands, he will say: ""By turbo-charging those areas — especially in London and the South East — you drive prices even higher and you force more people to move to the same expensive areas. ""The result is their commutes are longer, their trains are crowded, they have less time with their kids."" But a blow to him came with a survey by Ipsos MORI for the Evening Standard that showed 55 per cent of adults are dissatisfied with the Government — up seven percentage points from last month. Just 35 per cent are satisfied, down nine points. It gave ministers a net satisfaction rating of minus-20, compared to minus-four in June — with a strong collapse in support from female voters in the wake of the Matt Hancock affair scandal."

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps also confirmed that Hong Kong and Taiwan were going green while the British Virgin Islands turn amber. Cuba, Indonesia, Myanmar and Sierra Leone will be added to the red list when the changes come into effect from 4am on Monday, July 19. While Bulgaria and Hong Kong will be fully-fledged green list members, Croatia and Taiwan are on the green ""watch list"". Brits jetting to watch list countries are warned they could revert back to amber at any moment. The Balearics were added to the list only two weeks ago - meaning unjabbed Brits who have already booked now have holiday plans in tatters. Confirming the update - revealed earlier by the The Sun - Mr Shapps said: ""Travel is not the same as it was before the global pandemic. ""Clearly if you're booking to a green watch list country you need to make sure you can get your money back and change accommodation."" Reminding Brits of new rules, he added: ""Of course, for some people, children, those under 18, plus people who've been double vaccinated fully vaccinated, you won't have to quarantine you treat it as if it is still a green country."" Under new rules coming in next week, double-jabbed Brits will still be able to take advantage of the holiday destinations without the need to quarantine on return. But it means evicted Love Island stars who have not been fully vaccinated will be forced to isolate when they are booted out of the villa on Majorca. We are still living unfortunately in a world where things can and do change quite quickly Cases on the islands have soared to 258 cases per 100,000 people. It could spark a mad dash to get home for younger holidaymakers who have not yet received both doses of the vaccine. Double-jabbed Brits coming back after the switch will not have to isolate, but will still need to take a test before their return to the UK, and on the second day after getting home. Kids will also be exempt from isolation but those without a vaccine passport will have to spend ten days at home, and take three expensive tests. Travellers will be able to prove their vaccine status on their NHS app. Brits can still travel to the islands by showing their app, or proving they have had a negative test 72 hours before travel. It means the Costas of Spain and the campsites of France will remain off limits to the un-vaccinated as they will remain amber. The islands of Malta and Madeira, are currently on the green or green watch list. The rule change will open up travel abroad to 140 amber countries. However, anyone returning from green or amber countries must take a PCR test on return - with a second taken on the second day after arrival. Anyone arriving from a red country is forced into a quarantine hotel for ten days which costs £1750 per person. Green list countries from Monday 19"
165,165,The Sun,Harry ColeJerome Starkey,IRA terrorists to be given amnesties for Troubles in shock bid to end witch-hunt against British troops,"IRA terrorists will be given amnesties for Troubles atrocities in a shock bid to end the witch-hunt against British troops. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis will today announce a cut-off of 1998 for prosecutions against both sides. PM Boris Johnson had vowed to end British veterans being dragged through the courts over historic allegations — but ministers have conceded there is no way round an amnesty for the terrorists. Government lawyers warned protecting one side from prosecution would fall foul of European human rights laws unless legal clemency was also extended to Republican murderers. The amnesty will apply to all Brit soldiers and spies who served in Ulster from the late 1960s until the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. But it will spark massive controversy as it will include IRA bombers who killed and maimed on the mainland, too. Tonight, a senior Government source told The Sun: ""We want to give Northern Ireland society the best chance of moving forward. ""We must confront the difficult and painful reality that the realistic prospect of prosecutions is vanishingly small and while that prospect remains, Northern Ireland will continue to be hamstrung by its past."" But ex-Veterans Minister Johnny Mercer, who resigned in April after claiming our troops are being abandoned, branded it a cop out. He said: ""We should not cut off pathways to justice where evidence exists, simply because of time passed. It would be wrong to do so."" However, ex-SAS commando and author Andy McNab, who served in NI, told The Sun it was ""fantastic news and about time."" He said: ""You were left with a situation where the only side we were going after was our own, the security forces. People can jump up and down but this needed doing."" Meanwhile, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood used Parliamentary Privilege to name a soldier he said was involved in Bloody Sunday."
166,166,The Sun,Harry ColeJerome Starkey,Royal Navy’s most powerful flotilla since Falklands hit by major Covid outbreak after sailors went partying in Cyprus,"THE most powerful naval flotilla to sail from Britain since the Falklands War has been struck by a major Covid outbreak - after sailors went raving in Cyprus. Almost half the warships in the Royal Navy's carrier strike group have been hit by positive cases. They include at least 100 crew of the flagship aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth - who were all double jabbed. The virus ripped through the strike group's 3,700-strong crew after sailors were given a run ashore in Limassol. Navy sources insisted that none of the positive cases needed sick bay admission and numbers are starting to fall. But the ships will have to stay at sea for at least another three weeks and their next port calls could be postponed if the virus continues to spread. Commodore Steve Moorhouse, the carrier strike group commander, ordered all crews to take emergency measures including daily tests and staggered dining times where possible in a bid to limit infections. The Navy insisted the outbreak would not affect the strike group's mission. A Royal Navy spokesperson said: ""As part of routine testing, a small number of crew from the Carrier Strike Group have tested positive for Covid-19. ""All personnel deployed have received both doses of the Covid vaccine and there are a number of mitigation measures on board including masks, social distancing and a track and trace system. ""The Carrier Strike Group will continue to deliver their operational tasks and there are no effects on the deployment."" It is at least the third time HMS Queen Elizabeth has been struck by the virus which has crippled US and French warships. A defence source said: ""Affected personnel are under medical supervision and are isolating on their respective ships."" A US Nimitz class aircraft carrier was knocked out action for weeks after 900 crew tested positive last year."
167,167,The Sun,Jack ElsomHarry Cole,Boris Johnson sees off furious Tory rebellion led by Theresa May over £4bn cuts to foreign aid budget,"BORIS Johnson has seen off a furious Tory revolt led by Theresa May over £4billion cuts to the Government's foreign aid budget. The PM caught rebels flatfooted by ambushing them with a surprise vote in Parliament today - which he won this afternoon by a majority of 35. His predecessor was among a gang of Conservatives trying to overturn the Government's planned cut to the aid budget from 0.7 to 0.5 per cent of GDP. Rishi Sunak insists that the cut was needed to help plug the Covid black hole - and would save more than £4 billion every year. But a heated Commons debate saw angry rebels skewer ministers for ""turning their backs on the poorest in the world"". Announcing she will be voting against her party for the first time in a quarter of a century, Ms May said: ""This isn't about palaces for dictators and vanity projects. ""It's about what cuts to funding mean - that fewer girls will be educated, more girls and boys will become slaves, more children will go hungry and more of the poorest people in the world will die."" Ringfencing the 0.7 per cent commitment was a Conservative 2019 manifesto pledge but Mr Sunak took an axe to the budget at last November's Spending Review. Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle ruled that Mr Sunak needed the legal underpinning of a vote to go ahead. Ahead of the vote Mr Sunak picked off wavering rebels by offering a compromise plan. Under his proposals the Aid budget will be restored once the independent Office of Budget Responsibility rules that we are no longer having to borrow cash for day to day spending, and our national debt falls to a specific percentage of GDP. The tests mean aid spending might not return to 0.7 per cent before the next general election, scheduled for 2024. Rebel ringleader and ex-Development Sec Andrew Mitchell blasted the plan as ""no compromise at all"" - but a ""fiscal trap for the unwary""."

Marcus Rashford, 21, Jadon Sancho, 20, and Bukayo Saka, 19, received vile online abuse after missing penalties in Sunday's Euro final shootout — despite having been brave enough to take them. Furious Boris Johnson told racist trolls hounding the three young England aces to ""crawl back under your rock"". The PM led howls of outrage as police pledged to bring the racist abusers to justice. He said: ""To those who have been directing racist abuse at some of the players, I say shame on you. ""I hope you will crawl back under the rock from which you emerged."" He hailed the England players as ""heroes"" and said he had been ""sad and rueful"" but ""filled with pride"" like millions of people when he woke up yesterday. Mr Johnson also thanked the Three Lions' manager Gareth Southgate ""for the best campaign by any England team in any tournament that I can remember."" He added: ""They made history. They lifted our spirits — and they brought joy to this country and I know they will continue to do so."" Prince William — who attended the final at Wembley with wife Kate and Prince George, added his voice to the chorus of disgust. He tweeted: ""I am sickened by the racist abuse aimed at England players after last night's match. ""It is totally unacceptable that players have to endure this abhorrent behaviour. It must stop now and all those involved should be held accountable."" Southgate, 50, called the abuse his players faced ""unforgivable"". He said: ""It's just not what we stand for. We have been a beacon of light in bringing people together, in people being able to relate to the national team, and the national team stands for everybody and so that togetherness has to continue. We have shown the power our country has when it does come together and has that energy and positivity together ""We have shown the power our country has when it does come together and has that energy and positivity together."" England captain Harry Kane, 27, backed the youngsters who failed to convert their penalties. The Spurs striker tweeted: ""Three lads who were brilliant all summer had the courage to step up & take a pen when the stakes were high. ""They deserve support & backing and not the vile racist abuse they've had since last night. If you abuse anyone on social media you're not an England fan and we don't want you."" Arsenal rising star Saka, 19, touched the nation's hearts as he wept after missing the last penalty in the shootout against Italy. But moments later monkey and banana emojis began flooding into his Instagram account. Rashford, 23, and Sancho, 21, both faced similar online abuse. A mural of Manchester United star Rashford in his hometown of Withington was defaced with racist obscenities in the early hours. Later, residents flocked to the wall to leave messages of support for their local hero and love-heart stickers on the vandalised artwork. Rashford responded online with a statement, saying: ""The messages I've received today have been positively overwhelming and seeing the response in Withington had me on the verge of tears. ""The communities that always wrapped their arms around me continue to hold me up. ""I'm Marcus Rashford, 23-years-old, black man from Withington and Wythenshawe, South Manchester. If I have nothing else I have that."" Home Secretary Priti Patel said of online giants: ""They can no longer ignore some of the appalling, vile, racist, violent and hateful content that appear on their platforms. ""We have been clear that if they do not stamp this out, we will take action against them in the Online Safety Bill."" But last night England defender Tyrone Mings blasted Ms Patel who had previously accused members of the England team of being overly political, and refused to condemn people who booed the team when they took a knee. Mings, 28, tweeted: ""You don't get to stoke the fire at the beginning of the tournament by labelling our anti-racism message as 'Gesture Politics' & then pretend to be disgusted when the very thing we're campaigning against happens."" London's Met Police vowed to go after the trolls. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said: ""We've launched a post-event investigation and will actively pursue and investigate offenders and criminal offences."" The UK Football Policing Unit (UKFPU) will co-ordinate efforts to identify the hatemongers who could be charged under the Malicious Communications Act — punishable with up to 12 months in jail. Alternatively, the could be prosecuted for racially-aggravated harassment, which has a two-year term. Cheshire Chief Constable Mark Roberts, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead on football policing, said: ""Investigations are under way."" He said reports of online racist abuse would be assessed by the UKFPU and perpetrators identified with the help of social media firms. Ken Marsh, chairman of the Met's rank and file Police Federation branch, said: ""Every one of the trolls needs to be tracked down, named and shamed and prosecuted."" TV pundit and England legend Rio Ferdinand urged Twitter, Instagram and Facebook to take action. He tweeted: ""You can bet ya last pound they would have sung the Raheem Sterling song almost bursting the veins in their bodies doing so. ""But England lose and that joy and sense of being united immediately evaporates and our black players become the target."" He added: ""Social media companies please can we come together in creating a way to protect people on your platforms please…. Our young heroes need your attention too!"" The Sun's lion mascot Harry Mane had his head held high after England lost by a whisker. Brave Harry watched at a Rome bar and later enjoyed banter with 1,000 Italian fans in a square. Subjected to boos and chanting, he jokingly gave them a thumbs down. Harry said: ""I'm gutted but very proud. The players are heroes. ""I've been with hundreds of Italian fans but it's been very friendly. ""It's heartbreaking — but we all know the World Cup isn't far away."" Expat Simon Robinson, 44, who lives in Rome said: ""I'm sure Harry Mane gave us that fantastic extra edge but it wasn't to be."" Fellow expat Trevor Mills, 60, added: ""Harry, you've done so well. Our lads did so well. There's so much to be proud of."" By ex-West Ham goalie Shaka Hislop AS they took their penalties, I feared for Marcus, Jadon and Bukayo. I was worried that they might be scapegoated if they failed to score because they are black. The abuse they later received was awful. Over the last 25 years we've seen steady progress on racial equality but there needs to be much stronger and meaningful action between government and social media firms. The three who volunteered to take a penalty knew the racist abuse that would come their way if they missed. That shows courage and commitment to the country. They must be shown that level of respect in return."
169,169,The Sun,Harry Cole,Gareth Southgate on course to be given knighthood in New Year Honours list,"GARETH SOUTHGATE looks set to become a 'Sir' in the New Year Honours list. Boris Johnson wants to give the England boss a knighthood after his side's scintillating run to the Euro 2020 final lifted the entire nation. Southgate was handed an OBE when the Three Lions made the 2018 World Cup semis — but now a knighthood is in his grasp despite the pain of Sunday's penalty shootout heartbreak against Italy. Sources say the Prime Minister is ""supportive"" of the top honour after England's first major final in 55 years. Last night Johnson declared: ""They made history. They lifted our spirits and they brought joy to this country — and I know they will continue to do so. Like millions of people across this country I woke up sad and rueful but also filled with pride and hope. ""And with thanks to Gareth Southgate and the whole England squad for the best campaign by any England team in any tournament that I can remember."" And last night a senior No 10 source told The Sun that gongs await the squad, with a knighthood likely to come for the gaffer: ""There's a process to go through but Gareth's achievements have been incredible. ""He's brought the country together in an amazing way. The PM would certainly be supportive of a knighthood."" The honours system recognises people who have ""committed themselves to serving and helping Britain"" and made achievements in public life. They must be ""outstanding"" in their field, or make life better for others — which millions of fans will argue England have done. After a nomination, the decision to proceed — and which honour they will receive — is decided by the sports honours committee in Whitehall. The body reviews applications, sending their recommendations to the PM and the Queen, who awards the honour. Health minister Edward Argar told LBC radio: ""I'm sure there will be many ways to say thank you to them and recognise that, and I suspect that will be looked at in the coming days."" Southgate's next mission is to lead England to glory with his young stars at the World Cup in Qatar next year. The Three Lions boss will honour his deal, which runs to 2022, but will not yet commit any further. Southgate, 50, said: ""I don't want to commit to anything longer than I should and I never want to outstay my welcome. ""I'd want to be taking the team to Qatar. I feel we've made progress in four years. It's probably as good as any team in Europe bar those who won the tournaments themselves."" Southgate was gutted by the final defeat but sees great hope in young stars like Bukayo Saka, 19, Phil Foden, 21, Jude Bellingham, 18, and Jadon Sancho, 21. He said: ""When you're so close it's more painful — it feels like my stomach has been ripped out. ""But our young ones are two, four years from peaking. This team can go again, no doubt about it."""

The Chancellor has been under mounting pressure to give MPs a say over his plan to reduce the UK's legally binding pledge to giveaway 0.7 per cent of the country's output to the needy. He insists that the cut to 0.5 per cent of GDP is needed to help plug the Covid black hole - and would save more than £4 billion every year. But Labour and a significant number of Tories are firmly against the plan, even though No. 11 say it will be a temporary pandemic fix. After the plan was announced at last November's Spending Review, the Commons Speaker ruled that Mr Sunak needed the legal underpinning of a vote to go ahead. But Conservative MPs including ex-Aid boss Andrew Mitchell and ex-PM Theresa May had warned they would vote against the move. Voting it down would plunge Treasury spending plans for the next year into chaos - prompting the government to initially try avoid a Commons showdown. But The Sun understands Mr Sunak has spent the weekend working on a compromise  - promising the reduction will automatically expire when the nation's finances are more stable. Under the compromise plan, the Aid budget will be restored once the independent Office of Budget Responsibility rules that we are no longer having to borrow cash for day to day spending, and our national debt falls to a specific percentage of GDP. Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg announced today that MPs will debate the cut - and details of the Treasury compromise - in a three hour session and vote on Tuesday. He told MPs ""it will be a yes or no answer."" ""If the House were to negative the motion.. then the government would consequently return to spending 0.7 on international aid"" with ""consequences for taxation."" But the short notice for such a major vote will lead Mr Sunak open to accusations he is attempting to catch the rebels off guard. More follows..."
171,171,The Sun,Jerome StarkeyHarry Cole,Veterans accuse Boris Johnson of relying on ‘hope’ to save Afghanistan,"VETERANS slammed the PM yesterday for relying on 'hope' to save Afghanistan as the country careers towards civil war and the last foreign troops withdraw. He said he hoped rampaging militants would make a deal with the Afghan government to protect the fragile gains that British soldiers fought and died for. And he said he hoped the blood and treasure - 457 soldiers lives and £37 billion - would not have been spent in vain. President Biden ordered a US withdrawal without a proper peace deal and British and NATO commanders said they had no choice but to follow suit. Asked about the country's future Boris Johnson said ""hope"" three times. He told MPs: ""What we have to hope is that the blood and treasure spent by this country over decades in protecting the people of Afghanistan has not been in vain."" He added: ""We must hope that the parties in Kabul can come together to reach an agreement. ""Somehow rather we must hope that the accommodation must be found eventually with the Taliban."" Army veteran Tobias Ellwood, the chairman of the defence committee, said: ""Hope is not a strategy. ""We are abandoning the country to the very insurgent organisation that we went in to defeat in the first place."" Britain lost 454 troops and spent £37 billion trying to rebuild the country after helping the US topple the Taliban in October 2001. Thousands more lost limbs or suffered life-changing injuries on a mission to install democracy and improve women's rights. ""We cannot say Afghanistan is any safer today than it was after 9/11 because the country could easily harbour terrorist organisations including Daesh and Al Qaeda in the future,"" Ellwood added. ""There will be many military families and veterans asking themselves what was it all for."" Taliban insurgents seized more than 130 district centres in a brutal three-week onslaught as Afghan forces collapse without western support. Hundreds of Afghan troops fled across a border to neighbouring Tajikistan while others surrendered their weapons after running out of ammo. Prince Harry's hero Ben McBean, who lost an arm and a leg in a Taliban blast, said: ""If scrapping didn't work, I don't think hope is going to work. ""I won every war that I was involved in and so did everyone else. We did the best job we could do with what we had. ""But the bigger picture war, that was different. Everyone knows the score. To rely on hope, it's false hope."" Taliban insurgents seized a quarter of the country as Afghan troops collapsed without western support and warlords threatened to mobilise forces along old civil war lines. On Friday looters ransacked Bagram airbase - the largest foreign base in Afghanistan - after US troops snuck out in the night without telling its new Afghan commander. In April, US President Joe Biden announced the remaining 2,500 US troops would leave by September 11 - the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on America. Other NATO allies then confirmed they would follow suit, including the UK - which in May began withdrawing its remaining 750 military trainers. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace previously said Britain had been put in a ""very difficult position"" to continue the mission once the US announced its decision to leave."
172,172,The Sun,Harry ColeJonathan Reilly,Amber list travel update: Double-jabbed Brits can fly without quarantining from July 19,"DOUBLE-jabbed sunseekers will be able to fly to amber list countries without quarantining on return from July 19, The Sun can reveal. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will unveil the rules change on Thursday. It means hassle-free holidays to Spain, France and Greece will be back on for millions, all of which are on the amber list. A source told the Mail Online: ""Border Force do have to make some technical changes and they had asked for a bit longer to get the new systems in place. But they can see the writing on the wall on this and they have accepted it will be the 19th."" But travellers must take a test before they come back to Britain and another gold standard PCR test on the second day of return. It is understood those who cannot be jabbed will also be exempt from quarantine - children travelling with double-jabbed parents would swerve the ten-day isolation with extra testing. Ministers had been warned that delaying the boost for vaccinated holidaymakers would be a body blow to the summer travel season. Holidays expert Paul Charles said: ""It would be pointless introducing it in mid-August as the summer travel season will have been lost almost entirely — along with tens of thousands of jobs."" Many European countries are also only allowing in Brits who have had both jabs. Both Portugal and Malta are only welcoming fully-vaccinated Brits, along with France while Spain now requires a negative test, or proof of both jabs, from all UK arrivals. Brits heading to Cyprus will need to have two Covid tests unless they are fully vaccinated from tomorrow. However, Germany has recently lifted restrictions for Brits who are fully vaccinated, after initially closing their borders to the UK due to the Delta variant. While just the Balearic Islands, Malta and Madeira are on the green list as holiday hotspots, it is hoped that more destinations could also be added. Brits who have had both Covid shots will also be able to zoom through fast-track lanes at Heathrow under blueprints to open up travel to amber list countries without the need to quarantine. Travellers will be able to digitally upload their vaccination certificates ahead of their flights and be directed to separate queues at the London airport after presenting them on arrival. It will mean passengers who are fully vaccinated with be able to skip lengthy queues - slashing the time it takes to get through border controls and stamping out congestion. The scheme will be trialled by British Airways, Virgin and Heathrow following a meeting last week with Downing Street officials. Healthy Secretary Sajid Javid confirmed earlier this week that double-jabbed Brits will be allowed to skip self-isolation from August 16. He revealed plans to rip up the mandatory 10-day quarantine for close contacts of positive cases. People who test positive will still have to self-isolate for 10 days even if they're jabbed, he warned, and close contacts will still be urged to get a gold-standard PCR test to ""get certainty"" that they're not infected. Mr Javid also confirmed under-18s - who are not eligible for vaccines - will be able to avoid quarantine if they come into contact with a Covid case. He also gave further hope for normality, and said school bubbles will end on July 19, giving a major boost to pupils and parents. Mr Javid told MPs: ""On July 19 it is our plan to remove bubbles and to end the requirement for early years settings, schools and colleges to routinely carry out contact tracing"".

173,173,The Sun,Harry Cole,Gavin Williamson SCRAPS school bubbles from August 16 following clamour of parents and MPs,"SCHOOL bubbles will be scrapped in time for the new school year after another 640,000 children were forced to isolate last week. Nearly one in 12 state school pupils did not attend classes last week after coming into contact with a fellow student who tested positive. That was up 384,000 on the previous week, plunging schools across the country into disarray. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson announced last night bubbles would be replaced by focused testing and contact tracing from August 16. Under current guidance, children have to self-isolate for ten days if another pupil in their bubble — which can be an entire year group — tests positive. Schools will be able to continue with that system for the rest of term if they wish but the legal requirement will end before September. Instead, NHS Test and Trace will carry out contact tracing on pupils rather than the school or college working out who is at risk. The Education Sec also announced... Mr Williamson told MPs: ""Keeping children in consistent groups was essential to control the spread of the virus when our population was less vaccinated. ""We recognise that the system of bubbles and isolation is causing disruption to many children's education. ""That is why we'll be ending bubbles."" Mr Williamson added it would not be necessary to stagger start and finish times at schools. But the Education Secretary said some protective measures — such as enhanced hygiene and ventilation — would stay in place in schools for the autumn term."
174,174,The Sun,Harry ColeDan Keane,Lockdown easing: What you can and can’t do from July 19 from social distancing and Rule of Six to face masks,"BORIS Johnson has announced a wealth of new freedoms Brits will be able to enjoy from July 19 as the country emerges from lockdown. Social distancing, working from home and compulsory face masks are among the measures that will be scrapped on 'Freedom Day' - here's everything you can and can't do in a fortnight. The PM announced the measures in a press conference this evening as he told Brits that the country must now live with the virus. The relaxation of all measures will be confirmed on July 12, once the PM has reviewed the latest data. There was no confirmation just yet on the scrapping of school bubbles or whether double-jabbed Brits can travel to amber-listed countries or skip self-isolation. Mr Johnson said that Britain's vaccine rollout will allow ministers to swap ""Government diktats"" with the public's ""individual judgement"" - but stressed ""the pandemic is far from over"". Here we look at everything you can do in just fourteen days time. Brits will no longer receive a fine if they don't wear a face covering on public transport, the PM has announced. Commuters will still be encouraged to wear a mask while on a bus or train - but this will not be legally enforced. However, businesses will be able to set conditions for their premises - but Brits do not have to wear a face mask by law. Under current guidance, Brits face fines of up to £6,400 if they don't wear a face covering on public transport - unless they are medically exempt. Masks are also compulsory in shops, supermarkets, theatres, libraries, churches, youth and social clubs, hotels and most other indoor settings. A first offence carries a fine of £200, reduced to £100 if paid within 14 days. The penalty doubles for repeat offences up to a maximum of £6,400. But ministers will shift the emphasis onto personal responsibility rather than state-enforced rules as the nation emerges from the pandemic. Boris Johnson said he would wear a mask in crowded places full of strangers but suggested he would not on an empty train carriage late at night. The PM told the Downing Street press conference: ""I will obviously wear a mask in crowded places where you are meeting people that you don't know, as Chris (Whitty) was saying, to protect others and as a matter of simple courtesy. ""There's a difference between that, and I think everyone can understand that, and circumstances where you might find yourselves sitting alone for hours late at night on a train with no one else in the compartment and there I think people should be entitled to exercise some discretion."" The one-metre-plus social distancing rule will be scrapped on July 19 in a huge boost for the hospitality industry, Mr Johnson has announced. There will be no limits on how many people can meet socially, or where they can meet. This applies to weddings, funerals and other life events. Punters will finally be allowed to mingle and stand once again, while ordering from the bar will also be permitted. It comes as a huge boost to the hospitality industry, which has struggled to make a profit with limited capacity allowed indoors due to social distancing regulations. The PM tonight acknowledged that scrapping the rules was a risk, but said: ""If we don't go ahead now, when the summer fire break is coming up, the school holidays, all the advantages, that that should give us in fighting the virus, the question is, when will we go ahead?"" Punters will no longer need to check in to venues by scanning a QR code using the Test and Trace app, it was confirmed tonight. There will no longer be a legal requirement for Covid certification for any setting - though businesses will be permitted to continue to use the app if they wish to do so. It came after complaints from hospitality bosses that the app is leading to staff shortages as increasing number of employees are ""pinged"" and told to self-isolate. Brits will be heading back to the office from July 19 after months of remote working, the PM announced. Current guidance states that employees who can work from home must do so - despite swathes of the economy being open. But the rules will change from July 19 to allow firms to tell employees how and where they should work. The move comes as a boost for city centres, with many businesses seeing a plunge in revenue due to the lack of commuters. The Rule of Six will finally be scrapped in a huge boost for the hospitality industry. Groups of more than 30 people will also be allowed to meet up as limits on large gatherings are eased, Mr Johnson announced. Mass events, including festivals, will also be allowed from July 19, the PM said tonight. Festivals and concerts have been cancelled for the past 18 months as a result of social distancing restrictions. But mass events outdoors, such as full stadiums and festivals, are expected to get the go-ahead but with some element of testing or proof of vaccination required. Plans for double-jabbed Brits to be able to skip quarantine when travelling back from amber-listed countries were not announced tonight, with formal guidance expected this week. Under current guidance, anyone returning from an amber-listed country - including holiday hotspots such as Spain and Greece - must self-isolate for ten days when they return to the UK. Ministers are currently working on plans to allow anyone who is double-vaccinated to skip self-isolation with a rigorous daily testing regime - but this is not expected to be unveiled this evening. Travel guidance for those who are double-jabbed is expected to be updated later this week. There was no announcement this evening on when school bubbles will be scrapped. However, the school bubble system is still expected to be shelved and replaced by daily testing. Mr Johnson is set to announce that kids will no longer have to miss school if a student in their bubble has Covid. Those deemed close contacts will have to take lateral flow tests instead. Currently, anyone alerted by Test and Trace or the NHS App that they have been in contact with someone who has tested positive must — by law — isolate at home. But after a successful pilot scheme running since April, ministers are set to replace that rule for the fully vaccinated with 20-minute lateral flow tests taken each day for the same amount of time. However, the cabinet is still signing off the plans - with no announcement tonight. If you present a negative result, you would be free to leave the house that day. It comes after businesses complained that the number of staff being ""pinged"" by the app and told to self-isolate was causing staff shortages. Last week, around 400,000 people were told to self-isolate by Test and Trace staff or the NHS Covid-19 App. Plans will also soon be revealed let fully-vaccinated passengers returning from abroad duck quarantine. The PM hailed the vaccine rollout as the key clincher allowing him to take off the restraints. His spokesperson said today: The delay to step four has allowed our vaccination programme to save thousans more lives by vaccinating millions more people. ""As a result, the data shows the link between cases and hospitalizations has been severely weakened but not broken. ""We know that cases will continue to rise as society opens up further. This means that hospitalisation serious illness and deaths from Coronavirus will continue, albeit at a much lower level than before the vaccination."""
175,175,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson extends pub opening to 11.15pm for Euro 2020 final on Sunday in case of ET and penalties,"PUBS will be allowed to open until 11:15pm on Sunday night - in case the Euros final goes to extra time and penalties, The Sun can reveal. Boris Johnson this morning signed off plans for extra drinking time this weekend regardless of whether England make Sunday night's Wembley showdown. An emergency tweak of the law will be put forward to the Commons imminently to allow pubs to open for an extra 45 minutes serving on Final day. Normally they have to shut at 10:30pm on a Sunday but that risked fans - hopefully Three Lions ones - being turfed out if the showdown goes long. And the change to the law will happen regardless of whether England make the final after their crunch Semis clash with the Danes tomorrow evening. If the Three Lions are victorious tomorrow evening they will meet the winner of tonight's last four decider between Spain and favourites Italy at Wembley on Sunday evening at 8pm. But given Covid means a cap on the number of fans at the home of football, millions of Brits are hoping to cheer on England from the boozer. Last night Boris Johnson urged the nation to support the boys ""enthusiastically but sensibly"", but Downing Street was worried of upheaval if drinkers were turfed onto the streets at a crunch moment. A No10 source said: ""As the entire nation comes together to enjoy the Euros final on Sunday, we're putting extra time on licenses so fans can watch the whole game without fear of being kicked out before it's over. ""And we're backing England to make it there."" ⚽ ENGLAND vs DENMARK BETTING SPECIAL ⚽ England go into Wednesday night's Euro 2020 semi-final knowing they face not only Denmark - but the demons of the past, too. The Three Lions booked a spot in the Euro 2020 semi-finals with a crushing 4-0 win over Ukraine in Rome on Saturday night. Gareth Southgate's squad return to Wembley on Wednesday taking on a resurgent Denmark in the last-four. But Southgate knows more than anyone else in the squad how tough England's challenge will be.

176,176,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha Clark,Boris Johnson urges nation to cheer on England ‘enthusiastically but sensibly’ as he declares end to lockdown rules,"BORIS Johnson urged the nation to cheer on England ""enthusiastically but sensibly"" as he lit a bonfire of Covid laws ahead of Freedom Day on July 19. The Prime Minister declared an end to social distance rules and limits on how many people can meet up after 480 long days and will scrap almost all other regulations. In just two weeks' time, there will be no punishment or fines for mixing indoors in large groups in England for the first time since March 2020. The rule of six will be scrapped and mass gatherings will be allowed outside for the first time in 18 months. There will be no legal requirement to wear a mask on trains or in shops for the first time since last June, and no fiddly QR code check-ins at pubs. Defying critics who say Freedom Day should be delayed because of rising Covid cases, BoJo told the nation it was ""now or never to unlock"" thanks to the vaccine keeping deaths low. Hailing the end to ""government diktats"", the PM said now was the time for ""careful and balanced individual judgements"" as we learn to live with the bug. He said he would continue to wear a mask out of choice in crowded places as a ""common courtesy"" to others. It will remain illegal to defy orders to self-isolate on testing positive for Covid or coming into contact with a patient without being double jabbed. But speaking from No10, Mr Johnson warned: ""We must be honest with ourselves that if we can't reopen our society in the next few weeks, when we will be helped by the arrival of summer and by the school holidays, then we must ask ourselves when will we be able to return to normal?"" Further changes to school bubbles that force all kids into isolation if one in the class gets sick, as well as ending ten-day isolation and relaxing travel for the double jabbed are also coming this week. Mr Johnson confirmed ""we're looking to move to a different regime for fully vaccinated contacts of those testing positive, and also for children."" But gloomy top docs Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance were incredibly cautious about the months to come, saying cases will rise and the pandemic is far from over. And Boris himself refused to rule out ""contingency measures"" for the autumn and winter, saying we must prepare for more deaths from Covid and cases may hit 50,000 a day in weeks. The PM explained: ""We will continue to monitor the data, and retain contingency measures to help manage the virus during higher risk periods, such as the winter. ""We will place an emphasis on strengthened guidance, and do everything possible to avoid reimposing restrictions with all the costs that they bring."" However, Sir Patrick warned that ""hospitalisations are rising and rising quite steeply in some places, and we would expect them to continue… ""Vaccines have weakened the link between cases and hospitalisation, but it's a weakened link, not a completely broken one."" Professor Whitty weighed in to say he thinks mask-wearing should continue. He vowed to continue to use one in crowded places, or if others felt uncomfortable and wanted him to. Gloomster Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer took a swipe at the rules relaxing, saying: ""Lifting all protections in one go when the infection rate is going up is reckless."" But Tory MPs piled in to slam the possibility of bringing more restrictions back over the winter, if cases spiral yet again. Health Secretary Sajid Javid responded that extra powers were necessary for councils in case of local outbreaks. He added: ""There's no intention at this point that these powers are used, but we believe that it is necessary to have the powers in place."""
177,177,The Sun,Harry Cole,"Ordering pints at the bar to return in two weeks, Boris Johnson will reveal today","DRINKERS will be back standing at the bar ordering pints in TWO weeks time, Boris Johnson will declare today. The Prime Minister will address the nation this afternoon to set out his plans for Freedom Day - set for July 19 - that will see masks become voluntary in almost all settings and the end of table service in pubs and bars. Life will ""return to normality as far as possible"" with the one-metre plus social distancing rule lifted so punters can mingle and stand once again and will not need to scan QR to enter venues. And the rules telling people to avoid the office if they can will be changed to allow firms to choose how and where people work from July 19. Nightclubs will get the green-light to reopen without masks, although Brits will be urged to wear them in enclosed spaces like buses and trains - but only if they want to - with no fines for refusing. Tomorrow, the Government will finally publish their long awaited review into social distancing and vaccine passports - with widespread domestic use expected to be rejected. Mass events outdoors like full stadiums and festivals are also expected to get the go ahead, but with some element of testing or proof of vaccination. But plans for double jabbed Brits to no longer have to isolate after coming into contact with a Covid victim and mass-testing to replace bubbles that sees thousands of school kids sent home every week will NOT be announced today. A final decision on replacing both of those measures could come within days subject to Cabinet signing them off. And The Sun understands travel rules for fully vaccinated to visit amber-list countries without the need to quarantine are also set to be updated later in the week. We're going to now move into a period where there won't be legal restrictions, the state won't be telling you what to do Freedom Day will go ahead on July 19, subject to a final review in seven days time - even though cases continue to rise. Yesterday, another 24,258 positive cases were confirmed - but only 15 deaths were reported down nearly two per cent on week on week. Hospitalisations were up 24 per cent, with 1,953 admitted suffering from the disease in the last seven days. But with the arrival of upbeat new Health Secretary Sajid Javid - who declared on Sunday that lifting lockdown will actually help suffering Brits be HEALTHIER as well as boost the economy -  Boris Johnson has won his battle against Cabinet naysayers and overly cautious docs to push on for a ""maximalist"" approach to lifting Lockdown when Freedom Day comes. Yesterday top Cabinet Minister Robert Jenrick declared the data was looking ""very promising"" for a July 19 to go ahead, and top NHS boss Stephen Powis agreed the vaccine had ""weakened"" the link between Covid cases and deaths. Mr Jenrick confirmed the Freedom Day good news, telling TV interviews: ""We're going to now move into a period where there won't be legal restrictions, the state won't be telling you what to do"". He added: ""You will want to exercise a degree of personal responsibility and judgement - different people will come to different conclusions on things like masks, for example"" . The PM is expected to say:  ""Thanks to the successful rollout of our vaccination programme, we are progressing cautiously through our roadmap. Today we will set out how we can restore people's freedoms when we reach step 4. But Mr Johnson will warn the nation that cases will continue to soar and hospitalisations and deaths WILL go up in the coming weeks and months - but the time has come to live with the virus like the flu as the jab has slashed serious illness and deaths from Covid. He will add: ""I must stress that the pandemic is not over and that cases will continue to rise over the coming weeks. ""As we begin to learn to live with this virus, we must all continue to carefully manage the risks from Covid and exercise judgement when going about our lives."" As 20,000 a year die from influenza, with PM likely to face a barrage of questions on what he feels is an acceptable number of annual Covid deaths. Mr Johnson also faces a rearguard action from medics who want mask wearing to continue for months to come yet. Professor Adam Finn, from the Government's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said mask wearing is extremely valuable under certain circumstances and he does not plan to ditch his masks this month. He told Sky News: ""Well on a personal level I shall certainly be continuing to wear a mask if I've got any symptoms or if I'm in an enclosed space with lots of other people for a prolonged period of time, indefinitely in fact."" ""So I think mask wearing is obviously something we've learned is extremely valuable to do under certain circumstances. That doesn't mean I'll wear a mask all the time but it does mean I will some of the time."" Professor Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England, said he believed people would naturally be more cautious and may continue to wear face masks out of choice. He told Andrew Marr: ""I think some people will choose to be more cautious. Some people may choose to wear face masks in particular circumstances, such as crowded environments, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Those habits to reduce infections are a good thing to keep."" However, booster jab plans - with the most vulnerable given a third covid jab alongside their flu shot - are hoped to see off the worst return of Covid in the winter months, SAGE scientist Dr Mike Tildesley, said he was ""cautiously optimistic"" that widespread return to restrictions would not be needed: ""Hopefully we'll be well prepared moving forward and we won't need any sort of restrictions to be put in place as we move into the autumn and winter."" He added: ""I hope when we move into the autumn we can start to have a little bit more of what I call the flu relationship with Covid."""
178,178,The Sun,Joe DugganHarry Cole,Ordering at the bar could still be banned AFTER July 19 easing as councils force venues to keep table service and masks,"ORDERING at the bar could still be banned after July 19 with councils forcing venues to keep some rules, it's reported. Table service and masks in pubs may remain after Freedom Day in two weeks - despite Boris Johnson announcing later today the lifting of remaining Covid curbs. Masks will become voluntary in almost all settings and there will be an end to ""table service only"" in pubs, the Prime Minister will tell the nation. Life will ""return to normality as far as possible"" as the PM sets out his plans on ending restrictions, scheduled for July 19. The one-metre-plus social distancing rule will be lifted so punters in boozers can mingle and stand once again and they will not need to scan QR codes to enter venues. But hospitality chiefs warned punters some pubs and restaurants may keep masks, table service and the rule-of-six, as doomster councillors aim to keep  restrictions. Venues could keep the measures to reassure ""reticent"" customers, or if councils require them, The Telegraph reports. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of trade body UK Hospitality, said: ""There's going to be customers who are expecting everything to fall away and there's going to be places that they won't be able to do that."" She called on councils not to hammer pandemic-hit businesses with tough rules as they enforce Covid-risk assessments. Ms Nicholls said: ""I think there might be a temptation of local authorities, that needs to be resisted, to put in place actual fixed regulations or rules that are more restrictive than they need to be."" I think there might be a temptation of local authorities, that needs to be resisted, to put in place actual fixed regulations or rules that are more restrictive than they need to be Yesterday, 24,258 positive cases were confirmed along with 15 deaths reported, down nearly two per cent week on week.

Government guidance will advise people to consider wearing face coverings in crowded, enclosed places, it's reported. To add to the confusion shops and public transport may still enforce mask wearing after July 19, despite the PM tearing up the laws. People will be urged to use ""common sense"", but there is concern the new rules could cause chaos with pandemic-weary Brits. Meanwhile, millions of commuters on London's Tube may also need to keep wearing masks after July 19. London mayor Sadiq Khan has refused to rule out making face coverings compulsory on the network. Transport for London (TfL) could set its own conditions of carriage, but sources told the Daily Mail that would be ""very difficult"". TFL commissioner Andy Byford said: ""If Government advice is to drop masks, we will still take into account what our customers have said. ""What our customers have said is that they want to see a clean, safe,orderly environment."" Mask laws mean it is an offence for people to board a train, bus, plane or taxi without wearing one, unless medically exempt."
179,179,The Sun,Harry Cole,"Over 3million manual workers need to retrain to meet Boris Johnson’s green targets, experts warn","MORE than three million manual workers will have to retrain to meet Boris Johnson's green targets, experts warn today. In carbon-heavy industries such as building nearly a third of employees will have to be taught skills for equivalent roles in a net zero future. Brickies and bus drivers are among those who may have to learn to adapt if the UK is to meet its commitment to decarbonise industry completely by 2050. Think-tank Onward reckons 3.2million workers could be left behind without ""radical"" policy action now. It calls for new apprenticeships in green industry and ""net zero academies"" for regions with most high carbon jobs such as the North East and East Midlands. The organisation also wants to see tax credits for firms training workers in new jobs. It points out that the transport and construction industries are ""woefully prepared"" for the changes. But wages for the new green jobs, it adds, are almost a fifth higher than the national average and a third higher than existing roles in carbon-heavy jobs. Ted Christie-Miller, of Onward, says in a report that Whitehall has not woken up to the ""scale and urgency of the labour market challenge"". He states: ""Radical policies will be required to retrain or upskill millions of workers in both high-tech roles and low and medium-skilled technical qualifications to meet the challenge of net zero."" Caroline Flint, co-chair of the Getting to Zero commission, backed the report. The former Labour minister said: ""As Britain emerges from the economic trauma of this pandemic there's not a moment to waste. ""Onward has laid out in stark detail how ill prepared the British workforce is to meet the net zero skills challenge. Government must step up and skill up Britain to create a green recovery with better paid, secure jobs."" A Government spokesman said: ""We are committed to delivering the green jobs and skills needed for our net zero future and to seizing the economic opportunities of the global green industrial revolution. We are making considerable progress through embedding the skills agenda into our latest strategies on decarbonising industrial sectors and our landmark North Sea oil and gas deal, supporting the industry's transition to clean, green energy. ""Our jobs and skills programmes, such as apprenticeships, and Skills Bootcamps, are supporting people of all ages develop and thrive in green careers, and our Green Jobs Taskforce is helping us to develop plans for new long-term good quality, green jobs by 2030 and advise on what support is needed for people in transitioning industries""."

Gove ally Robert Jenrick slammed calls from the opposition for the Cabinet Office boss to publicly declare where has been living as ""appalling"". After suggestions Mr Gove had moved out of his family home, Mr Jenrick hit back: ""They have no evidence at all, it is utterly unsubstantiated."" Shadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said Mr Gove ""should clarify"" if he's broken any social distancing rules during the breakdown of his marriage to journalist Sarah Vine. The pair announced they were splitting up after 20 years on Friday. But Mr Jenrick blasted the call - made in light of the Matt Hancock affair scandal. He told Times Radio: ""I think it's appalling if Labour have said that. ""I've not seen any evidence to suggest anything of that sort and this seems to me to be an entirely private matter for Michael Gove and his family so I don't intend to comment on that at all. ""I don't think Labour have any evidence to support that claim. It seems like that's entirely unsubstantiated. This is a personal matter. ""Michael Gove and his wife are friends of mine. ""Of course I wish them well but it's not something that we should be commenting on as politicians and it's very unfortunate that the Labour Party have chosen to make a statement like that."""
181,181,The Sun,Olivia BurkeHarry Cole,Ordering at the bar set to return from July 19 as social distancing comes to an end in huge boost for pubs,"BRITS will reportedly be able to order at the bar in boozers from July 19 as the government scrap social distancing measures. The Prime Minister will address the nation this afternoon to set out his plans for Freedom Day - set for July 19 - that will see masks become voluntary in almost all settings and the end to hated table service only orders in pubs and bars. He plans to tear up the Covid rule book in England on his ""terminus date"" - which many have dubbed Freedom Day - as restrictions are finally set to ease completely. But Mr Johnson will warn the nation in a conference on Monday that cases will continue to soar and hospitalisations and deaths will  go up in the coming weeks and months - but the time has come to live with the virus like the flu as the jab has slashed serious illness and deaths from Covid. ""I must stress that the pandemic is not over and that cases will continue to rise over the coming weeks,"" he will add. ""As we begin to learn to live with this virus, we must all continue to carefully manage the risks from Covid and exercise judgement when going about our lives."" Mask-wearing will become voluntary in all settings and punters will be able to drink at the bar as the requirement for table service is ditched, The Sunday Times reports. It would see the back of masks, distanced tables, and screens in venues across the country, allowing the hospitality industry a chance to heal as they could operate at a larger capacity and serve more customers. Large events such as festivals will also be given the green light, according to the paper. It comes as: Businesses have been exasperated with the constant shutdown of venues as a result of positive cases recorded by the NHS Test and Trace app - which was ""casting the net wide"" on who it pings. Chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, Emma McClarkin, said pubs were ""closing or greatly reducing their opening hours due to staff shortages caused by app pings"", despite staff testing negative for coronavirus using quick-result tests. But according to the publication, the need to scan QR codes when entering establishments will be axed after July 19, allowing bars and restaurants to continue operating instead of being shut after being flagged for self-isolation by Test and Trace. The use of vaccine passports will also be assessed this week as the results of the task force reviews roll in, the Sunday Express said. A Downing Street source told the paper that although modelling suggesting the unlocking would see a spike in cases, the UK's pioneering vaccine rollout allows the Government to be ""confident there will be no risk of additional pressure on the NHS"". The Prime Minister is set to address the nation on Monday to set out his plans for Freedom Day - set for July 19. He is expected to announce: 1 - No fines for not wearing masks on busses and trains but you can wear if you want. 2 - No social distancing in pubs, bars and clubs and end to table service only. 3 - No need to scan QR code to enter venues. 4 - No order to work from home - its up to firms to choose. 5 - No widespread domestic use for vaccine passports to get a pint. 6 - No more ban on mass outdoor events like festivals. BUT THREE BIG FREEDOMS STILL TO BE ANNOUNCED LATER... HOPEFULLY: 1 - No need to quarantine for double jabbed Brits travelling back from Amber countries. 2 - No more school ""bubbles"" that see thousands of kids send home because a handful of cases. 3 - No more isolation for double jabbed Brits after being ""pinged"" for coming into contact with Covid victim - details still being argued about by Ministers. They hope to get rid of self-isolating for close contacts with a positive case, seeing the end of the chaotic school bubble system, provided they undergo repeated tests that have a negative result. Double-jabbed Brits are also expected to be able to return from amber list countries without having to quarantine from July 19. It comes as Sajid Javid vowed to lift the remaining coronavirus restrictions on July 19 as he plans to make Britain the ""most open country in Europe"". He wrote in the Mail on Sunday, ""The economic arguments for opening up are well known, but for me, the health arguments are equally compelling. The pandemic has hit some groups disproportionately hard. Rules that we have had to put in place have caused a shocking rise in domestic violence and a terrible impact on so many people's mental health."" A Downing Street spokeswoman told reporters, ""No decisions have been made but more details will be set out soon."" Although Brits will be buzzing to get back to a taste of normality, the news is set to unnerve some senior doctors who petitioned for some restrictions to remain due to an ""alarming"" rise in Covid cases. As of 9am on Saturday, there were another 24,885 lab-confirmed Covid cases, the Government confirmed, while 18 others had died within 28 days of testing positive."
182,182,The Sun,Harry ColeDr Robert Lefever,Boris Johnson’s food tsar to recommend SIX per cent tax on salty foods in bid to get Brits healthy,"BORIS Johnson's food tsar is to recommend a tax on salty foods, The Sun can reveal. Millionaire Leon founder Henry Dimbleby will put the new levy front and centre of his government review into getting Brits to eat healthier. Sources familiar with drafts of the upcoming National Food Strategy say it suggests a tax of SIX per cent on high-salt content foods. That could see the price of a McDonald's Big Mac soar by 20p and push a bag of Quavers to 91p. The levy would hit processed meats like bangers and bacon particularly hard but is modelled on the sugar tax in a bid to get manufacturers to slash the amount of salt in their products. The 18p per litre tax on sugary drinks came into force in 2018, but supporters claim it led to companies changing recipes to swerve the levy. Mr Dimbleby has been tasked to find ways to get the nation to eat less salt, red meat, saturated fats and sugar, and more vegetables and fruit. Last night a source familiar with the draft said: ""Meat products contribute to 26 per cent of our daily sodium intake, with bread making up up 10 per cent. ""All of this would be hit by the high salt tax."" Last night No10 said the report was ""still a piece of work that's ongoing"". But angry campaigners demanded plans for a salt tax be killed off immediately. John O'Connell, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: ""This is yet another case of middle-class meddling that will hit the poorest families hardest."" SAVOURY foods like crisps and pizza are set to become more expensive, with the Government recommending a six-per-cent tax rise on salty foods. Food tsar Henry Dimbleby, the millionaire founder of the Leon restaurant chain, wants the new levy on everything from a bag of Quavers to McDonald's Happy Meals. Just like the sugar tax before it, this approach simply won't work. Those who like and enjoy salty foods will seek them out and eat them anyway. Sadly, it is always the UK's poorer households that will feel the financial burden most acutely and this comes in the midst of a pandemic when many are already struggling. As we saw with the sugar tax, it is these hard-working families that tend to buy more sugary drinks and snacks and despite a rise in cost, they will continue to do so. Little has changed since the sugar tax was introduced in April 2018 and obesity is still a huge problem. Statistics from NHS Digital show that more than 60 per cent of the UK's adult population are now overweight or obese and those figures have been rising steadily since the Nineties. The result will be the same for salty foods. It is cheaper, processed foods that tend to contain a lot of salt. Those in low-income households are buying these foods because of a six-per-cent rise in cost and this tax in no way improves their health. They are still consuming the salt. The only difference is that their bank balance is struggling more because of it. Instead of hitting our waistlines, it is hitting most of us in the pocket as well now. So who does this tax benefit? Only the Government, who will always look for ways to tax us as they are so good at spending our money. It wins them votes, and consumption taxes like this one help them to avoid rising income tax, which would make them very unpopular. They like to think they are doing good and, in this case, they claim they are lowering salt consumption and saving us all from high blood pressure, preventing thousands of strokes and heart attacks. Salt CAN increase blood pressure and, if you eat too much, it is bad for your health. But the truth is, for many of us, salt isn't the evil it is made out to be. It's a preservative and many food companies add it just to prolong the shelf life of products. If your blood pressure is at a healthy level then there is no harm in eating some of the foods you enjoy — in moderation, of course. Food is meant to be pleasurable but the Government never tells us to go out and have a bit of what you enjoy. One thing a salty diet always does is to make us more thirsty. Does the Government really want us to cut down on everything we drink. What fun will be left? And what will they tax next to make up for the lost revenue from beer, wine and spirits? If anyone is to blame it is the companies making these products and producers should be forced to make these products healthier before they hit supermarket shelves. Salt stimulates the appetite. It hits the tongue with a real whammy and then you crave more. There's little harm in eating the odd bacon sandwich or handful of Pringles. My heart goes out to people who just want a little treat here and there and are already living hand to mouth. Instead of punishing hard-working Brits with rising food bills and costs, the Government should persuade companies to do something to make their own products healthier so we can all get on with our lives."
183,183,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson says Britain is in the ‘final furlong’ of the fight against Covid,"BRITAIN is in the ""final furlong"" of the race to beat Covid, Boris Johnson said today. Hailing the vaccine as a ""an amazing thing"", the PM declared hospitalisation and deaths remaining low means Freedom Day is in ""scope"". And he said he would set out exactly how far restrictions will be lifted in ""the coming days."" The PM has been pushing for a ""maximalist"" approach to lockdown lifting with an end to social distancing and mask wearing in pubs and shops. But it is thought he's backed down to medics who want masks to continue on public transport. Speaking on a visit to Nissan in Sunderland, Mr Johnson hinted at some rules staying, saying ""there may be some things we have to do and some extra precautions that we have to take, but I'll be setting all that out."" But in a upbeat assessment of the latest data, the PM added: ""All I am saying to people is we're now in the final furlong, I really believe."" ""We have to look very carefully at the data and at the moment what we're certainly seeing is a big increase in cases - 26,000 as you will have seen - but that is not translating into a big increase in serious illness and death. ""And so it looks ever clearer that the vaccination programme, the speed of that vaccine rollout, has broken that link between infection and mortality. That's an amazing thing."" Mr Johnson continued: ""I know how impatient people are to get back to total normality as indeed am I and I will be setting out in the course of the next few days what Step 4 will look like exactly. ""But I think I've said it before, we'll be wanting to go back to a world that is as close to the status quo ante Covid as possible, to try to get back to life as close to it was before Covid."""
184,184,The Sun,Harry Cole,Rishi Sunak unveils his new top dog – a red Labrador pup named Nova,"RISHI Sunak has unveiled his new top dog Nova. The eight week old fox red Labrador posed for The Sun on the Chancellor's lap in his 11 Downing Street study yesterday. After meeting neighbour Boris Johnson's rescue pooch Dilyn, Mr Sunak's young daughters had been pestering him for months to get their own. A No11 source said: ""Rishi was fighting it but finally gave in, and the whole building is cooing over him."" Pals say the tiny pooch has a taste for roast chicken and napping in the Chancellor's famous red Budget box. Like her owner, Nova will have to share the Downing Street garden with their number No10 neighbour. Lively two year old Jack Russell Dilyn was rescued by Boris and wife Carrie Johnson in 2019, and has become a regular feature in official meetings and events. Dogs now equal cats in Downing Street, in bad news for Larry the No10 cat and Gladstone the Treasury moggy."
185,185,The Sun,Harry ColeJonathan Reilly,Double-jabbed Brits won’t have to isolate for 10 days if they come into contact with Covid victim from July 19,"BRITS who have had both jabs will no longer have to isolate for ten days if they come into contact with a Covid victim from July 19, The Sun can reveal. Currently, anyone alerted by Test and Trace that they have been near someone who has tested positive must — by law — isolate at home. But after a successful pilot scheme running since April, ministers are set to replace that rule for the fully vaccinated with 20-minute lateral flow tests taken each day for the same amount of time. If you are negative, you would be free to leave the house that day — in a major boost for workplaces. Our revelation comes as travel bosses, publicans and punters demand clarity from the Government about exactly what next month's Freedom Day will mean. PM Boris Johnson said this week he wants to go ""back to life as it was before Covid as far as possible"" on July 19. But there are major headaches for the Government over European travel, with the EU threatening to slap Brits with quarantines because of the surging Delta variant cases. Talks with Washington about opening the US border have also stalled. In angry Commons exchanges, MPs demanded answers from Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. Tory grandee Liam Fox said: ""We are welcome in France if we have had two jabs as they cover all the main variants — equals good sense. ""If we have had two jabs, we have to isolate on return from France to UK — equals no sense. French Uefa official comes to the UK and does not have to isolate — equals second-class citizens in our own country."" Tory MP Huw Merriman told Mr Shapps there was a need for clarity for ""industry and passengers alike."". He said: ""We have a roadmap with data and dates. For international travel, can we have the equivalent of a flight path so we know what is going to happen and when and by what measure?"" Fellow Tory MP Julian Sturdy welcomed ministers' plans to scrap quarantine rules for amber list countries but demanded clarity on when the rules would come in. He said: ""Ideally, we need it in place at the start of the summer holidays to give families the confidence to book and ensure it has the maximum impact in helping the travel sector to recover. If this is delayed for too long, the summer for the travel sector will be lost."" And Crawley MP Henry Smith warned last night: ""If we don't have a meaningful summer of transatlantic operations, it's expected to cost the UK economy £2.5billion and up to 52,000 jobs lost."" Last night, their demands were backed by travel industry leaders worried many Brits will end up on staycations in resorts like Blackpool unless there is more certainty. Tim Alderslade, CEO of Airlines UK, which represents BA, Virgin and Easyjet, told The Sun: ""It's madness to waste our vaccine dividend in the way we are. More than 60 per cent of the population have now been fully jabbed and we should be allowing them to travel without restrictions. ""Instead, all we have is a vague commitment to do so 'later in the summer', which, frankly, will be too late to save the summer season. We need to get on with it."" Travel expert Paul Charles, of the PC Agency said: ""The vaccines are clearly working, so Sajid Javid has an opportunity to make this summer better than last summer, in terms of letting people travel. There's no reason not to open up more overseas travel to other countries and remove onerous testing required on returning to the UK. ""The US and UK have such a special relationship that they should be opening up in July, enabling people to see family and friends they haven't seen for over a year."" And an ABTA spokesman said: ""With the successful vaccine roll-out both here and across the pond, the Government should be making progress on opening up travel between our two nations."" The pub and hospitality industries also demanded better clarity and action from Government yesterday. Kate Nicholls, of UK Hospitality said: ""Hospitality is desperate for a full lifting of all restrictions on July 19 and we need early clarity and certainty that will be the case. This is not just about social distancing. Scrapping the rule of six, table ordering, bans on standing at the bar, music and capacity caps are all vital to secure the survival of our pubs and restaurants. ""At best, our businesses are losing money hand over fist every day those restrictions remain in place. At worst, they cannot trade at all. We cannot continue to operate with one hand tied behind our back, constrained by rules meaning pubs and restaurants remain in a fragile state and can't make enough cash to survive long-term."" Emma McClarkin, CEO of the British Beer & Pub Association, said: ""We have all played our part in the fight against Covid. Now it is time to get on with it and return our lives to normal, with our freedom protected by the vaccine. Restrictions from seated-only drinking, no bar service and social distancing are ruining our pub experience."" Meanwhile, the Balearics were gearing up for the arrival of the first ""green-flight"" Brits yesterday. Changes by the Spanish government to entry requirements for UK holidaymakers did not appear to have dampened the optimism among expat bar workers on the islands. By the weekend, Brits jetting to Majorca, Ibiza and Menorca will have to be double-jabbed or produce a negative PCR Gold Standard test. But Tommy Goodwin, 35, of Stockport, manager of Mr Miyagi's and Tiger Tiger bars in Magaluf, said: ""The Balearics going on the UK's green light list is definitely going to have a positive effect on business."""
186,186,The Sun,Harry Cole,Matt Hancock and aide Gina Coladangelo ‘are now living together’ days after ex-Health Secretary revealed affair to wife,"MATT Hancock and his lover aide Gina Coladangelo are believed to be living together just days after he revealed the affair to his wife. The disgraced ex-health secretary, who resigned over the weekend, quit on his wife Martha last week after 15 years of marriage. Gina, 43, has also called time on her own 12-year marriage with Oliver Tress - who was said to have been left ""devastated"" by the shock revelations. Hancock is now understood to be living with his lover - less than a week after their affair was revealed by The Sun. Gina was last seen loading her £70,000 Audi outside the pair's £3.6million home just hours before news of her affair with boss Matt broke last Friday. And The Sun revealed last night that the ex-minister will try to turn his affair with his aide Gina Coladangelo into a proper relationship, her friends claim. A neighbour in Wandsworth, South West London, said: ""Gina and Matt are giving it a proper go and Olly was left reeling. ""They had lots of friends here so we are all trying to help look after Olly."" Martha Hancock, 44, had no idea that her husband of 15 years was having an affair until he broke the news on Thursday night and announced their marriage was over. Friends have rallied around her after Hancock, 42, and millionaire lobbyist Ms Coladangelo were caught on CCTV in a clinch at his Whitehall office. Martha, who has maintained a dignified silence after revelations of her husband's affair broke, has been seen out wearing her wedding ring since the scandal emerged. Family friends told the Daily Mail that the revelation of Mr Hancock's affair had come as a shock to his wife and she had no suspicions over Ms Coladangelo. Like her husband, she had met Ms Coladangelo at Oxford University - and the pair were friends on Facebook. Ms Coladangelo, who has been a close friend of the former cabinet minister since their time at university, was appointed as a non-executive director at the Department of Health and Social Care last year. She is the marketing and communications director at popular British retailer Oliver Bonas, which was founded by her husband Oliver Tress. According to her LinkedIn profile, she has been working as a non-executive director at the Department of Health since September 2020."
187,187,The Sun,Harry Cole,Matt Hancock’s mistress Gina Coladangelo saved string of posts on social media that could allude to love life,"MATT Hancock's mistress saved a string of posts on social media that could allude to her love life. Gina Coladangelo used her profile on Pinterest to declare ""the longer the wait, the sweeter the kiss"" in a ""pin"" to her board. The account, which also features references to her family, has numerous pins of quotes and interior design ideas saved in the last six months and back to 2019. Pinterest is often used as an online mood board for people to save photos, recipes and pleasing designs. Other quoted messages she saved on her profile recently include: ""It's ironic how you feel most alive when your heart skips a few beats."" Another message said: ""I'd rather die of passion than boredom."" One she saved to her mood board reads: ""People will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel."" Another on the publicly visible account says: ""Have you ever felt a connection with someone? ""Not in lust, or in their image, but in the richness of their soul and the vibes they give off."" And an F. Scott Fitzgerald quote she saved reads: ""They slipped briskly into an intimacy from which they never recovered."""
188,188,The Sun,Harry Cole,Matt Hancock’s mistress Gina Coladangelo dumps husband Oliver Tress for relationship with shamed ex-minister,"MATT Hancock will try to turn his affair with his aide Gina Coladangelo into a proper relationship, her friends claim. The ousted Health Secretary quit on his wife Martha last week after 15 years and is now understood to be living with his lover. Gina, 43, has called time on her own 12-year marriage with Oliver Tress after her affair was exposed. Oliver, 54, the millionaire Oliver Bonas founder, is said to be ""devastated"" by the shock revelations, as family pals confirmed the split. Gina was last seen loading her £70,000 Audi outside the pair's £3.6million home just hours before news of her affair with boss Matt broke last Friday. A neighbour in Wandsworth, South West London, said: ""Gina and Matt are giving it a proper go and Olly was left reeling. ""They had lots of friends here so we are all trying to help look after Olly."" The latest twist in the scandal came as Britain's most senior lawyer declared The Sun was right to reveal cheating Hancock's lockdown-breaking office clinch. Asked if there was public interest in our scoop, Lord Chancellor Robert Buckland said: ""In a nutshell, there was. I think it's important those of us who help set the rules, adhere to them."" Boris Johnson yesterday appeared to suggest he had sacked Mr Hancock. The PM said: ""I read the story on Friday and we've got a new Health Secretary in post on Saturday. ""I think that's about the right pace to proceed in a pandemic."" No10 later confirmed Mr Hancock had resigned. Meanwhile, the Commons erupted in fury after ministers denied claims that the camera in Mr Hancock's office had been planted. Labour MP Chris Bryant said: ""The Government is saying the camera was not covert. The Secretary of State knew it was there. If that's true, he must be the stupidest man on Earth."" No10 also dismissed wild claims the camera could have been planted by a hostile state and was being investigated by spooks. Mr Johnson's spokesman said: ""I've seen a lot of reported speculation I don't recognise at all."""
189,189,The Sun,Harry ColeKate Ferguson,"Matt Hancock backed by Boris but as the questions pile up, will he survive?","BORIS Johnson's attempt to rule Matt Hancock's affair ""a closed matter"" bombed last night as questions mounted for the cheating Health Secretary. The unfaithful Cabinet minister is engulfed in allegations he broke the lockdown law and the ministerial code after The Sun revealed his office canoodling with an aide. And he has still been unable to explain how glamorous pal Gina Coladangelo — exposed as his lover by this newspaper — got a £15,000 advisory role last September. Tory colleagues blasted Hancock's ""phenomenal sense of self-entitlement"" after his attempt to tough out the scandal by saying he was getting on with the day job of fighting the pandemic. And opposition parties branded the PM spineless for not giving him his marching orders. The minister's rule book explicitly states ""working relationships should be proper and appropriate"" and ""ministers must ensure that no conflict arises, or appears to arise, between their public duties and their private interests."" But Hancock was caught in a steamy clinch with Ms Coladangelo in his office in the Department of Health on May 6, as Covid raged. Yesterday, top barrister Adam Wagner said it was one of the worst cases of lockdown law-breaking because ""it is his law — his name is on the paperwork"". It comes as: The Sun can reveal today the pair were still enjoying passionate canoodling sessions on official premises as recently as this week. Yesterday, the married father of three issued a 46-word apology for flouting social distancing and cheating on his wife. But he refused to quit. Hancock said: ""I accept that I breached the social distancing guidance in these circumstances. I have let people down and am very sorry. ""I remain focused on working to get the country out of this pandemic, and would be grateful for privacy for my family on this personal matter."" Boris refused to sack him despite growing rage from his own MPs. Desperately trying to bat away the sleaze scandal, the PM's official spokesman said: ""The Prime Minister has accepted his apology and considers the matter closed."" In a 30-minute briefing with journalists, the PM's spokesman dodged crucial questions about whether Hancock breached the ministerial code and the law. Meanwhile, both Downing Street and health officials refused to say what role Hancock had in appointing Ms Coladangelo and if their affair started before she was brought into government. Pals say they struck up a romance last month but no spokesman would confirm this formally amid rumours the pair had been close for years. Parliamentary records show he sponsored her for a Commons pass in 2019. It gave her unfettered access a year before she became his adviser at the Department of Health. Last night No10 insisted that her appointment followed ""all proper procedures"" but no further details were given. Hancock ducked questions by cancelling a planned visit to a vaccine centre at Newmarket Racecourse in Suffolk. But as he was hammered by criticism from legal experts and MPs, a growing number of Tory insiders called for his scalp. A senior minister said of the former aide to ex-Chancellor George Osborne: ""He was part of that George Osborne crew who had everything handed to him on a plate: the seat, the jobs, everything. So they have very little self-awareness and don't realise how bad things like this look to normal people. The sense of entitlement is phenomenal."" Another senior Tory aide said: ""There's not a lot of love lost for Hancock. He should just go and not hang around. ""You can't take away people's freedoms for the best part of a year while having it off with an aide in an office and expect to get away scot-free."" One senior Conservative MP told The Sun: ""The pandemic may save him until the reshuffle — but he is toast."" Hancock was also labelled a hypocrite after slamming Professor Neil Ferguson over his lockdown-breaking affair — a year before his own was exposed. Speaking on telly last year, the Health Secretary said he was left ""speechless"" after discovering ""Professor Lockdown"" had broken rules to meet his married lover indoors. The Imperial College prof quit as a Sage adviser over the breach. Labour seized on the scandal to call for Hancock's head. Party chairwoman Anneliese Dodds fumed: ""If Matt Hancock has been secretly having a relationship with an adviser in his office — who he personally appointed to a taxpayer-funded role — it is a blatant abuse of power and a clear conflict of interest. His position is hopelessly untenable."" Rumours swirled around Westminster that Vaccines Tsar Nadhim Zahawi is lined up to replace him. And in yet another kick in the teeth, his arch nemesis Dominic Cummings launched a fresh assault on his handling of Covid."
190,190,The Sun,Rob PattinsonHarry Cole,Matt Hancock’s secret affair with aide Gina Coladangelo is exposed after office snogs while Covid raged on,"HEALTH Secretary Matt Hancock has been having a secret affair with his closest aide, The Sun can reveal today. He cheated on his wife with Gina Coladangelo, 43, who he hired last year with taxpayers' money, as Covid gripped Britain. Mr Hancock, 42, and millionaire lobbyist Gina were caught on camera in a steamy clinch at his Whitehall office. Whistleblowers revealed the Health Secretary had been spotted cheating on his wife of 15 years with married Ms Coladangelo. He was seen kissing her at the Department of Health's London HQ during office hours last month as the mutant strain began spreading. And today, Mr Hancock apologised for his actions, saying: ""I accept that I breached the social distancing guidance in these circumstances. ""I have let people down and am very sorry. It comes as: ""I remain focused on working to get the country out of this pandemic, and would be grateful for privacy for my family on this personal matter."" A Whitehall whistleblower told The Sun it was ""shocking that Mr Hancock was having an affair in the middle of a pandemic with an adviser and friend he used public money to hire"". Last night, a friend of the Health Secretary said: ""He has no comment on personal matters. No rules have been broken."" Mr Hancock was pictured embracing his aide. The image was from just after 3pm on May 6 — as the rest of Westminster was engrossed by the local elections. He is seen in his distinctive ninth-floor office inside the sprawling Department of Health building, which is a stone's throw from the Houses of Parliament. During the pandemic, the office has provided the backdrop to his Zoom appearances on TV — including the Andrew Marr Show. Mr Hancock is seen checking the corridor is clear before closing the door and then leaning on it to ensure he cannot be disturbed. Ms Coladangelo then walks towards him and the pair begin their passionate embrace. According to a whistleblower, who used to work at the department, the pair have regularly been caught in clinches together. The source said: ""They have tried to keep it a secret but everyone knows what goes on inside a building like that. ""I'm just amazed he was so brazen about it as he was the Secretary of State. ""It has also shocked people because he put her in such an important, publicly-funded role and this is what they get up to in office hours when everyone else is working hard."" The office where the tryst happened is where Mr Hancock famously hangs his Damien Hirst portrait of the Queen. The affair will inevitably raise questions about his focus on the UK's virus battle after he was accused of ""lies"" over his handling of the pandemic. He stands accused of failing care home patients with botched testing, wasting billions on a bungled Test and Trace rollout and squandering millions on PPE contracts which failed to deliver. It's shocking he was having an affair with an aide he used public money to hire. Anneliese Dodds MP, chair of the Labour Party said today: ""If Matt Hancock has been secretly having a relationship with an adviser in his office - who he personally appointed to a taxpayer-funded role - it is a blatant abuse of power and a clear conflict of interest. ""The charge sheet against Matt Hancock includes wasting taxpayers' money, leaving care homes exposed and now being accused of breaking his own COVID rules. ""His position is hopelessly untenable. Boris Johnson should sack him."" And it is not the first time he has been accused of misusing public funds as the virus crisis raged. His former neighbour was awarded a lucrative contract worth millions to help make Covid tests, despite having no previous experience in the field. Alex Bourne, who ran Mr Hancock's local in Suffolk, WhatsApped the Health Secretary to offer his services, sparking sleaze allegations from opposition MPs. Former No10 adviser Dominic Cummings also launched an astonishing tirade against Mr Hancock's handling of the crisis. Mr Cummings, 49, suggested the health supremo should have been sacked for dozens of failures and had lied to the Prime Minister on multiple occasions. Mr Hancock has repeatedly challenged Mr Cummings to present evidence for his claims and appeared to have toughed out the row. Boris Johnson had thrown a supportive arm around his embattled cabinet colleague, but faces a tough decision in light of The Sun's bombshell revelations. Word of the affair has been circulating within the department with colleagues openly discussing the situation on WhatsApp. Mother-of-three Ms Coladangelo is communications director at Oliver Bonas, the fashion and lifestyle store founded by her husband Oliver Tress. She is also a director and major shareholder at lobbying firm Luther Pendragon, which offers clients a ""deep understanding of the mechanics of government"". Mr Hancock secretly appointed her to his department as an unpaid adviser on a six-month contract in March last year. It sparked claims of a ""'chumocracy"" when it became public knowledge in November. It also emerged she had accompanied Mr Hancock to confidential meetings with civil servants and visited No10. Sunday Times sources revealed at the time: ""Before Matt does anything big, he'll speak to Gina. She knows everything."" I'm just amazed he was so brazen about it as he was the Secretary of State. In September, Mr Hancock appointed her as a non-executive director at DHSC, making her a powerful member of the department's oversight board. It hit the headlines as there was no public record of the appointment, which was set to see her earn at least £15,000 of taxpayers' money, potentially rising by a further £5,000. The role makes her responsible for ""overseeing and monitoring performance"" — in effect, scrutinising matters of concern to Mr Hancock. A DHSC spokesman said the appointment was ""made in the usual way and followed correct procedure"". It is also understood that since April, she has had a parliamentary pass, giving her unregulated access to the Palace of Westminster. It bears her husband's surname, which she does not use professionally, and is sponsored by Lord Bethell, the hereditary peer, health minister and former lobbyist. She was working previously for Luther Pendragon. The firm boasts clients who have secured lucrative contracts during the pandemic, including British Airways and Accenture, which received £2.5million to help build the NHS Covid-19 app. The pair first met at Oxford University in the early 2000s but Mr Hancock went on to wed Martha Hoyer Millar in 2006. The Hancocks remain married and have three children. Mr Hancock is not the first senior figure to be embroiled in a pandemic sex scandal. Professor Neil Ferguson had to quit his government advisory role after meeting his married lover during the first lockdown. The boffin, 51, broke social distancing rules when he allowed Antonia Staats, 38, to visit him at his home at least twice. Prof Ferguson led the team at Imperial College London which honed Britain's Covid-19 battle plan while claiming 500,000 Brits would die unless it was enforced. Other high-profile individuals caught out for breaking Covid rules included Dominic Cummings. He travelled 260 miles from London to a family cottage in Durham while suffering Covid symptoms at the height of the pandemic in March 2020. His rule-breaking was exposed in May 2020, sparking national fury despite him saying he had acted ""reasonably and legally""."
191,191,The Sun,Harry Cole,"Matt Hancock’s job hangs by a thread after ‘f**king useless’, PPE & care home rows and now CHEATING scandal","MATT Hancock's career at the top of the Conservative Party was hanging by a thread last night as he was engulfed in a sleaze scandal. The shock development follows a torrid 18 months for the Health Secretary in which he has been battling the Covid pandemic — even catching it himself last year. Mr Hancock has spent the past few weeks dodging claims he bungled his handling of the bug — and was left embarrassed over leaked texts in which the PM branded him ""f***ing hopeless"". Just this week, the Queen was overheard describing the exhausted minister as a ""poor man"" but still ""full of promise"". Despite the runaway success of the vaccine rollout, it was already shaping up to be a bruising summer for the usually energetic Tory amid rumours he was for the chop at a pending reshuffle. He has been dogged by ""chumocracy"" claims that he had hired his mates and given party donors special VIP access to Covid contracts. Earlier this month, he was hauled before MPs for a gruelling evidence session to defend his record. But it is our bombshell revelation today that will be cricket-mad Matt's toughest wicket yet. And this afternoon, Mr Hancock apologised for his actions, saying: ""I accept that I breached the social distancing guidance in these circumstances. ""I have let people down and am very sorry. ""I remain focused on working to get the country out of this pandemic, and would be grateful for privacy for my family on this personal matter."" He has been privately canoodling with a glamorous pal he hired as his aide — in the very office from which he is meant to be leading Britain's response to the virus. After a meteoric rise through the backrooms of Westminster, he even had a tilt at the party leadership in 2019 — but bowed out to Boris Johnson after a poor show of support from colleagues. Already in his third cabinet post, aged just 42, he has had a relatively blemish-free career until this year. Like many a Tory MP before him, he drifted from an elite public school to Oxford to read philosophy, politics and economics — the training manual for Britain's modern political class. It was at Oxford that his path first crossed with Gina Coladangelo, a fellow undergraduate who would remain a close pal for the next two decades. But it was his fateful decision to hire her — first as an unpaid adviser last April and then as a £15,000-a-year non-executive director at the Health Department — that could yet be his undoing. After a masters at Cambridge in economics, Mr Hancock walked into a plum job at the Bank of England. While at Threadneedle Street, the rising star first caught the eye of the Conservative Shadow Chancellor at the time, George Osborne. And the lure of Westminster was too much for the nerdy twenty-something to resist. In 2006, Mr Osborne drafted the young whizzkid in to be his top adviser. But it was soon clear to colleagues that Matt was not content on a career in the shadows and eyed his own path to power. He married Martha, an osteopath, in 2006 and the pair have three children together. Elected MP for the ultra-safe seat of West Suffolk in 2010, he set his eyes on climbing the greasy pole as quickly as possible Sticking close to his powerful mentor Mr Osborne, he quickly drew ire from jealous colleagues who could see Matt destined for the fast track. One joke levelled at other ambitious MPs back then was they were ""so far up George Osborne's a*** they could see Matt Hancock's shoes"". Although he made enemies, the blessing of Mr Osborne soon saw him on the Government payroll, first as a junior minister in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in 2013, entering the Cabinet in 2016 as Minister for the Cabinet Office. Under Mr Osborne's guidance, he voted Remain in the 2016 referendum, and looked to be in the wilderness when his political godfather was dramatically sacked by new PM Theresa May in the wake of the historic vote. He accepted a demotion to a junior role at Culture, winning him plaudits as other key figures flounced off to the backbenches — and going some way to countering his Westminster reputation as an arrogant upstart. And his loyalty to the party and the new PM was rewarded with a Cabinet return in 2018 as Culture Secretary, and a massive promotion to Health shortly after. While seen as a ""safe pair of hands"" in Cabinet, regularly tasked with tricky media performances defending the Government, the pandemic that began to engulf Britain early in 2020 would be Mr Hancock's biggest test. A regular face seen fronting Government press conferences, with boundless enthusiasm for the jabs rollout, that handling of the crisis has come under fresh scrutiny in recent weeks as a massive row with No10 exploded into public view. Mr Hancock is one of the most powerful officials in government and a member of the ""quad"" of Cabinet ministers who determine Covid-19 policy. Some even credit him with persuading the PM to return to a second lockdown. But two weeks ago, astonishing private WhatsApp messages leaked by sacked No10 aide Dominic Cummings showed Boris had branded Mr Hancock ""totally f***ing hopeless"" in the darkest days of March 2020. The vengeful Mr Cummings published a 7,000-word blog laden with messages from the PM complaining about the Health Secretary's handling of the Covid crisis, and said he should have been sacked for dozens of reasons. One message from March 2020 shows Mr Cummings complaining to the Prime Minister about Mr Hancock's handling of Britain's testing programme. The PM bluntly replies: ""Totally f***ing hopeless."" Mr Johnson later blasted attempts to buy more PPE as a ""disaster"" and suggested Mr Hancock be stripped of responsibility. In a message from April 2020, the PM said: ""I can't think of anything except taking Hancock off and putting Michael Gove on."" When questioned about Mr Cummings's allegations by MPs probing the pandemic fall-out, Mr Hancock hit back alleging that the Prime Minister's former top aide had briefed newspapers against him. He told reporters that ""governing has been easier"" since Mr Cummings was forced out late last year. And he has repeatedly challenged Mr Cummings to ""put up or shut up"" with evidence he lied about discharging elderly hospital patients to care homes in the early days of the pandemic without proper testing. Mr Hancock looked to be over the worst of the crisis before today. As well as facing accusations his department had wasted billions on a shaky Test and Trace system, spending watchdogs also criticised multi-million pound contracts for PPE that failed to materialise. He was also found to have committed a ""minor breach"" of the ministerial rule book after failing to declare his 20 per cent stake in his sister's company that was awarded a Covid contract. No stranger to tough questions, the Health Secretary now faces his toughest grilling yet. While Boris has thrown a protective arm around him so far amid the firestorm of claims from Mr Cummings, No10 may not have the political capital to save Matt this time."
192,192,The Sun,Harry Cole,Government bid to challenge release of double child killer Colin Pitchfork,"JUSTICE Secretary Robert Buckland is poised to tell the Parole Board to rethink its decision to free double child murderer Colin Pitchfork, The Sun can reveal. Government lawyers say there is an ""arguable case"" that it is ""irrational"" to release the fiend, who raped and killed two girls of 15 in 1988. Sources say Mr Buckland may act on their advice this weekend. Pitchfork — the first person to be convicted using DNA evidence — was jailed for life over the deaths in Leicestershire of Lynda Mann in 1983 and Dawn Ashworth in 1986. Dawn's mum Barbara, 75, has backed Mr Buckland's attempts to keep the ""psychopath in prison where he belongs"". Lynda's mum Kath said Pitchfork should be ""locked up forever"". Baker Pitchfork was denied parole in 2018. The matter was reconsidered in March this year and, on June 7, the Parole Board ruled him suitable for release. The Ministry of Justice had three weeks to challenge the decision, which expires on Monday. Sources believe it may follow lawyers' advice A spokesman for Mr Buckland last night declined to comment."
193,193,The Sun,Natasha ClarkJonathan ReillyHarry Cole,"Travel green list set to include Malta, Madeira and ‘Balearic Islands’  TODAY in boost for sun-starved Brits","MILLIONS of sun-starved Brits will today finally get the green light for travel to a slew of  sunshine isles. Holidaymakers can jet off for a week or more in Malta and Madeira and avoid quarantining when they get back as a new travel green list kicks in at 4am next Wednesday. The Balearic islands of Ibiza, Majorca and Menorca were last night also on the cusp of being added, with a final decision being made at a meeting today. And in more good news, The Sun can reveal family holidays abroad could cost £500 less under plans to slash the number of expensive tests faced by double-jabbed Brits on their return. Instead of up to three, they may need just one. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is expected to bump up the holiday islands in changes separate to the Government looking into allowing those who've had two vaccine doses, and their kids, to  avoid quarantine. Pressure is mounting for those measures to be unveiled  when lockdown is due to end on July 19. Travel expert Paul Charles, from consultancy The PC Agency, said: ""The data proves most amber countries are safe to travel to and from now, so quarantine should be removed in line with the great UK unlocking."" Currently,  Brits have to get at least two tests when returning from green-list countries, while amber countries require a minimum of three. Gold standard PCR tests required for entry to the UK cost around £120, meaning a massive burden on travelling families. But the Transport department has drawn up plans to slash the number of tests for double-jabbed returnees from amber countries in August. Ministers are meeting today to hammer out the new rules, though they have been met with fierce resistance from the Home Office and Department of Health. Last night, a Government source told The Sun: ""We want to get things moving, but the usual suspects want to be more cautious."" Meanwhile, hundreds of cabin crew, pilots and travel agents called on ministers to relax the rules to avoid a summer of ""chaos"". They joined a day of action organised by industry body Abta outside Parliament in Westminster, Holyrood in Edinburgh and Stormont in Belfast. The demonstrators, many wearing uniform, took over College Green in central London, carrying placards reading ""speak up for travel"" and ""allow safe travel overseas"". Paul Naylor, 49, from Steppes Travel, said: ""We've got people crying out for a holiday whether short or long-haul, and our industry is totally and utterly dependent on the Government regulations. ""We understand safety comes first but we just need the help and support to get us through because an industry in demand should not be allowed to go under."" Arron Mitchell, director of Syte Travel, said: ""What we really need is a tourism minister that understands the entire outbound tourism industry, because no one in Parliament understands how travel works. They refuse to meet with the industry leaders. ""We need tailored support for the travel industry, an expansive green list and freedom to travel for those that are double vaccinated."" Protesters also  demanded transparency over why the Government has failed to put countries with low Covid rates on the green list despite them apparently meeting the criteria for inclusion. Travel operators said they had been hit with costs and had not been able to take full advantage of support measures such as the furlough scheme because staff were needed to manage bookings and process refunds for cancellations. Bharat Gadhoke, of the Association of Independent Tour Operators, added: ""People have sold their house, their car, taken their pension out to pay money back and we are still in the position where the Government slops around what they're going to do. It's been chaos."" Mark Tanzer, chief executive of Abta, said:  ""They've created a traffic light systems which has tests, it has quarantine, it has checks and is risk-assessed and we understood that. ""And then it is suddenly overlayed by, 'You shouldn't be travelling anyway' — and that has dented consumer confidence and bookings."" While Brits are kept at home, Germans have been allowed to fly to islands such as Majorca. Last night, Mr Shapps said: ""Of course I very much hope the world could open up. ""We've got to follow the data, and that's what we'll be doing in the meetings over the next few days."" He spoke as the number of Covid cases in the UK rose by  16,135 — the highest daily number of new infections in almost five months. The  total since the pandemic began now stands at 4,667,870. Deaths also rose, by 19, taking the toll to 128,027. A total of 75,188,795 vaccinations have been given with 31,740,115 people having had two doses."
194,194,The Sun,Harry ColeJack Elsom,Indoor mixing joy as Rule of 6 WILL finally be ditched on July 19… but not masks,"FAMILY and friends will be able to meet in unlimited numbers indoors from July 19 — but the country will be stuck with mask wearing on trains and buses for months. The six-person cap on mixing inside is to go and the number who can meet outdoors will also be unlimited. But masks look set to continue to be a part of everyday life, dashing hopes of a full lifting of lockdown. It is likely the £6,000 fines for failing to muzzle up on public transport will be dropped, we can reveal. However, government scientists want recommendations for masks to stay to prevent the spread of Covid. Ministers last night scotched fears that punters could be forced to wear masks in nightclubs after leaked government modelling showed the idea had been tested. One told The Sun: ""I don't think it will be feasible. ""There's a big question about whether or not you could even enforce masks. People might just take them off."" Government sources said ministers had been examining several scenarios for months before deciding that the idea was ""unworkable"". In key Covid developments: It came as the drive to vaccinate teenagers and people in their 20s gathered pace across the UK in an effort to crack down on the spread of Delta variant. Boris Johnson wants to defy doomster scientists and rip up the hated curbs. Senior Government sources said the PM is set on giving Brits as many freedoms as possible, which will help breathe life back into hard-hit pubs and restaurants."
195,195,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson hails UK’s Covid vaccine rollout as key win from Brexit – but vows best is yet to come,"THE PM hailed the UK's jabs scheme as a key win five years on from the Brexit vote but vowed the best is yet to come. Boris Johnson said unshackling from the EU, despite the tortuous divorce, will help us recover more quickly from the pandemic. Mr Johnson declared we could not have ""delivered the fastest vaccine rollout anywhere in Europe"" still tied to Brussels. And he added that we can now ""shape a better future for our people"". BoJo, in a statement to mark the five-year anniversary of the day more than 17million Brits voted to quit the EU, insisted it remains his ""mission"" to use the freedoms won in that fight to rebuild Britain. Mr Johnson added: ""The people made the momentous decision to take back control of our destiny. ""This Government got Brexit done and we have already reclaimed our money, laws, borders and waters. ""Now, as we recover from this pandemic, we will seize the true potential to unite and level up our whole United Kingdom. ""With control over regulations and subsidies, and with freeports driving investment, we will spur innovation, jobs and renewal across every part of our country. ""Our clear mission is to utilise the freedoms it brings to shape a better future."" The PM has repeatedly teased Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer for voting to keep Britain a member of the European Medicines Agency. Had we been tied to the regulator, experts say our rollout success would not have been possible as Brussels were weeks behind us in starting to jab citizens. But last night devout Remainer Sir Keir risked a fresh row by promoting a key pro-EU aide to be Labour's Brexit spokesman. Baroness Jenny Chapman, a passionate campaigner for a second referendum, will shadow Brexit guru Lord Frost in the Lords."
196,196,The Sun,Harry Cole,Double-jabbed Brits could take unvaccinated kids abroad in WEEKS in mega boost for holidays,"DOUBLE-jabbed mums and dad could take unvaccinated kids abroad in just WEEKS in a huge boost for summer holidays. Plans to allow adults with two doses to travel in August to amber list countries are due to be announced within days. However, ministers are under growing pressure to bring forward the move to next month to save school holidays overseas. Some MPs are even said to be pressing Boris Johnson for travel curbs to be eased at the same time as restrictions are lifted at home  - on July 19. At the moment only people going to green-list countries are automatically free once they return home from travelling - although they do have to take at least two expensive PCR tests. Anyone coming back from an amber-list country has to quarantine for ten days at home. But a new system to allow adults who have had two doses to travel in August to and from such countries - including holiday France, Spain, Italy and Greece - without quarantining are set to be announced within days. And unjabbed family members aged under 18 will be able to fly too as they have not been offered the vaccine. Brits will find out later this week about any updates to the important green and amber travel lists. It comes as: Ministers will meet on Thursday to decide if any new countries should be added to the list of destinations where foreign holidays are currently allowed. However it's been reported official scientists have advised ministers that the Balearic Islands are now safe to be given green status. That would mean quarantine-free breaks to Ibiza, Mallorca Menorca and Formentera could resume within days.  Malta is also being tipped to be added. They would be the first mainstream holiday destinations on the list since the sudden removal of Portugal last month. However, mainland Spain will remain on the amber list, meaning that travel is advised against, and quarantine is required on return. Meanwhile, akey ally of Chancellor Rishi Sunak has already called for the changes to kick in sooner rather than later. Tory MP James Cartlidge has written to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps to demand double jabbed Brits be given freedom next month. He said: ""The proposal to restart international travel by allowing fully vaccinated people to go on holiday would be an absolute lifeline for this industry."" He added: ""I believe that allowing fully vaccinated people to travel is reasonable, and an important step we can take to support our fantastic travel business."" Sources have said Mr Sunak was supportive of the call but did not put his  right hand man up to writing the letter Earlier today Matt Hancock revealed that ministers were indeed looking at plans for whether double-vaccinated Brits might be able to avoid quarantine in future when they travel abroad. The Sun understands the new rules will mean under 16s will be able to go with their parents on holiday - but only if both parents have had two jabs. And it's likely they will have to wait two weeks after that for their protection to kick in - as is already the case in the EU travel rules. An announcement is expected as early as this week, alongside an update on the green, amber and red-list destinations. But as The Sun revealed yesterday, it's unlikely that many will be added - if any. At the moment only people going to green-list countries are free once they return home from travelling - though they do have to take at least three PCR tests. Anyone coming back from an amber-list country has to quarantine for ten days at home. And those returning from a red-list destination have to stay in dedicated quarantine hotels, paying a whopping £1,750 for the privilege. Boris Johnson has been accused of letting Germans steal a march in the sunbed wars - as double-jabbed Brits still have to stay away from many beach destinations thanks to strict travel rules. Germans are free to travel and have wasted no time getting the towels down despite the EU's bungled jabs rollout and the country averaging more than 100 deaths a day. Scientists, MPs, travel bosses and holidaymakers last night warned Brits risk being left behind despite our plummeting death rate and the fact that almost all adults have had at least one vaccine shot. Mr Johnson did say the country was ""looking good"" for domestic unlocking on July 19 but he was downbeat about foreign holidays. Government adviser Professor Robert Dingwall, a public health expert at Nottingham Trent University who sits on the government's Nervtag advisory group, told The Sun last night that it was time to ""stop jumping at shadows"" and give Brits their holiday freedoms back. He said: ""Fully vaccinated people should have freedom of movement, or as much freedom of movement as any other country will allow them. ""We have a persistent misunderstanding of risk. If you're double vaccinated, there is very little risk to you from travelling anywhere else on the planet, because the vaccines would work just as well in Kathmandu as in Kenya. ""The concern is that vaccines do not stop you getting a mild infection with some local variant. ""If you bring it back into the country where pretty much everybody else is double vaccinated, they are all protected to the same extent that you are. ""There's a failure to think this through from a risk management perspective perhaps rather than a public health perspective."" Prof Karol Sikora, of the University of Buckingham, said: ""It's cruel to ruin everyone's summer holiday for reasons which simply aren't backed up by the science. ""Current travel restrictions will not stop new variants coming in anyway because the actual procedures are not rigorous enough. Cases will inevitably slip through. ""The Government should either shut down the borders completely and not let anyone in, or open up travel for the rest of us. ""It's no good preaching about the risks while allowing world leaders to enjoy a jolly on the beach in Cornwall."" His plea was echoed by senior Conservative MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith, who urged: ""Let's just get this all into some perspective and re-evaluate the risks faced by people."" The former Tory leader warned: ""We cannot totally eliminate the risk but the vaccines should be acknowledged as the game-changer they are. ""There is no reason for the summer to be tough for people who have been double jabbed."" Asked about the proposals to let double-jabbed Brits out of quarantine this morning, Mr Hancock said: ""It is absolutely something we're working on, it's something I want to see. ""We're working on plans to allow the vaccine to bring back some of the freedoms that have had to be restricted to keep people safe. ""We'll get there when it's safe to do so. We want to do this right, we want to do this carefully and properly. ""But of course we do want to get those freedoms back. That's the whole point of the vaccination programme. ""When I'm in a position to be able to say something more concrete then we will do."" A top Public Health England medic also hinted double-vaccinated Brits won't have to isolate after foreign trips in future. Dr Susan Hopkins said there may be ""alternatives to isolation"" for holidaymakers who have received both of their Covid jabs. But she warned that Brits should stick to home holidays this summer. Asked if there is a chance those who have had two jabs could go abroad, she told the BBC's The Andrew Marr Show: ""We'll be looking at the evidence from other countries. ""We've talked a lot to countries like Israel who are ahead of us in the vaccination campaign, and they are now really looking at allowing people to come into their country who've had two vaccines and not needing to isolate. ""And they are allowing their population to travel more. ""We will need to be alert and will need to consider how we can measure the response of these vaccines to new variants that come along. ""But we are moving steps forward, and I think that in a time in the future, I'm not sure when, I can imagine a situation where we will have alternatives to isolation for people who have two doses of the vaccine."""

198,198,The Sun,Harry ColeJonathan Reilly,Boris Johnson accused of letting Germans steal a march in the sunbed wars as double-jabbed Brits languish at home,"BORIS Johnson was last night accused of letting the Germans steal a march in the sunbed wars as double-jabbed Brits languished at home. Germans are free to travel and have wasted no time getting the towels down despite the EU's bungled jabs rollout and the country averaging more than 100 deaths a day. Thousands hit beaches in Gran Canaria, Majorca and mainland Spain to soak up the warm sun while frustrated Brits were stuck at home in the cold and rain. They have free access to travel to most of Europe and only need one negative PCR test before going home while Brits returning from amber list countries — such as France, Greece and Spain — must isolate for ten days and get tested twice. German health minister Jens Spahn has launched a digital vaccine passport valid across the EU and from Friday the fully vaccinated can enter Germany if two weeks have passed since their jab. Scientists, MPs, travel bosses and holidaymakers last night warned Brits risk being left behind despite our plummeting death rate and the fact that almost all adults have had at least one vaccine shot. Yesterday just five Brits were confirmed to have died as hospitalisations remained extremely low sparking claims the spooked PM is ""jumping at shadows"". Despite the statistics, The Sun can reveal the green list for safe travel is ""unlikely"" to be added to at a review this week. Another is due at the end of July, but will come too late for many holidaymakers. Mr Johnson did say the country was ""looking good"" for domestic unlocking on July 19 but he was downbeat about foreign holidays. He said: ""There will be hassle, there will be delays I'm afraid, because the priority has to be to keep the country safe and to stop the virus coming back in."" Warning of a ""rough winter"", he said: ""You can never exclude there will be some new disease, some new horror that we simply haven't budgeted for, or accounted for."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said his department was working on measures to allow fully vaccinated Brits more freedom, but he warned: ""We're not ready to be able to take that step yet, but it's something I want to see and we will introduce, subject to clinical advice, as soon as it's reasonable."" The foot-dragging comes despite Department of Health figures showing that no vaccine-busting Covid strains have been imported from amber list countries. In the three weeks to June 9, of 1,418 people to arrive home from Spain, 1,222 from France, and 484 from Greece, only four tested positive, none with a mutant variant currently of concern to ministers. Government adviser Professor Robert Dingwall, a public health expert at Nottingham Trent University who sits on the government's Nervtag advisory group, told The Sun it was time to ""stop jumping at shadows"". He said: ""Fully vaccinated people should have freedom of movement, or as much freedom of movement as any other country will allow them. ""We have a persistent misunderstanding of risk. If you're double vaccinated, there is very little risk to you from travelling anywhere else on the planet, because the vaccines would work just as well in Kathmandu as in Kenya. ""The concern is that vaccines do not stop you getting a mild infection with some local variant. ""If you bring it back into the country where pretty much everybody else is double vaccinated, they are all protected to the same extent that you are. ""There's a failure to think this through from a risk management perspective perhaps rather than a public health perspective."" Prof Karol Sikora, of the University of Buckingham, said: ""It's cruel to ruin everyone's summer holiday for reasons which simply aren't backed up by the science. ""Current travel restrictions will not stop new variants coming in anyway because the actual procedures are not rigorous enough. Cases will inevitably slip through. ""The government should either shut down the borders completely and not let anyone in, or open up travel for the rest of us. ""It's no good preaching about the risks while allowing world leaders to enjoy a jolly on the beach in Cornwall."" His plea was echoed by senior Conservative MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith, who urged: ""Let's just get this all into some perspective and re-evaluate the risks faced by people."" The former Tory leader warned: ""We cannot totally eliminate the risk but the vaccines should be acknowledged as the game-changer they are. ""There is no reason for the summer to be tough for people who have been double jabbed."" Tim Alderslade, boss of Airlines UK which represents BA, Virgin and easyJet, said the government must follow the data. He added: ""It shows it is perfectly safe to open up travel to many countries while maintaining a robust red list to high-risk destinations. ""If they continue down this road — ignoring the data as well as the effectiveness of their own vaccine programme — they will never open up travel anywhere ever again."" A Ryanair spokesman said: ""We call on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to open up international travel to all vaccinated people without further delay. ""Vaccinated citizens should be immediately allowed to travel freely. It is completely nonsensical to keep vaccinated people locked up when scientific data has demonstrated vaccines are effective against all variants."" ﻿Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said he understood travellers' frustrations. He said: ""I totally get it. For me it's been very difficult because I want to go on holiday but I've chosen not to because of the restrictions. ""It's a difficult one to balance."" He said the data from amber list countries was ""encouraging"". However, Brits will not benefit from Germany's border reopening as its government is to keep in place the entry ban for arrivals from virus variant areas, such as the UK."
199,199,The Sun,Natasha ClarkHarry Cole,All kids aged 16 & 17 to be offered Covid vaccine before school starts in September,"YOUNGSTERS aged 16 and 17 are to be offered a vaccine before they head back to school in September, The Sun can reveal. Ministers want to roll out jabs to children for the first time — subject to approval from top medics, which insiders say could come within weeks. The move emerged as the nation was today meant to be celebrating Freedom Day, when Covid restrictions were finally lifted. With that postponed, Downing Street is now desperate to meet the new Freedom Day target of July 19 — which coincides with the date when all adults are due to be jabbed. They also want to offer all A-Level and college students aged 16 and 17 a vaccine in August, before they head back to education in the autumn. A Whitehall source told The Sun: ""Subject to approval from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, we have the capacity and willingness to push on to this important age group. ""Late teens are some of the most socially active members of society so if we can cut that transmission, it can only be a good thing."" Hundreds queued yesterday at Tottenham Hotspur's stadium in North London, which opened as a one-day pop up vaccination centre. Slots were made available on an appointment or walk-in basis in a huge inoculation push. Jabs clinics have also been set up at the grounds of West Ham, Chelsea, Charlton and Crystal Palace. There had been fears that younger people would be less willing to take up the jab. Officials had looked abroad and seen ""massively positive data"" for the benefits of vaccinating young people. The Sun understands there is enough supply of Pfizer and Moderna jabs to vaccinate the teens before the end of August. However, it will continue to be voluntary and ministers have no plans to force them to get jabbed. It is expected that there will be no decision on whether to jab over-12s until more data on the safety of the vaccine and trials in younger children are completed. Ministers are currently in a race to give five million more second vaccinations so Britain can be unlocked by July 19. Prof Kevin Fenton, regional director for London at Public Health England (PHE), said the capital was entering a ""summer sprint"" to get as many people vaccinated as possible in time for the unlocking. Yesterday PHE boss Susan Hopkins said she wanted to see all over-40s jabbed to safely unlock on Freedom Day, as the PM has promised. She added: ""We should be able to hit the 70 per cent figure having two doses before July 19."" At the current rate, Britain is on track to give another five million Brits their second dose — giving them extra protection and more power to stop hospitalisations — within the next four weeks. Ms Hopkins also confirmed reports that Brits may be able to escape the hated ten-day travel quarantine if they are double jabbed, saying: ""I think that in a time in the future, I'm not sure when, I can imagine a situation where we will have alternatives to isolation for people who have two doses of the vaccine."" However, she was more gloomy on the prospect of a wider surge in cases and suggested that another lockdown might be needed if hospitals are flooded with Covid patients. She said: ""We may have to do further lockdowns this winter. ""I can't predict the future — it really depends on whether the hospitals start to become overwhelmed at some point."" Justice Secretary Robert Buckland also refused to rule out the idea, saying: ""The essence of the virus is you can't ever say mission accomplished."" But Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said the North West is ""coming through"" the latest phase of the pandemic and extra support given to the area was paying off. He told the BBC: ""I think we are coming through this. I think we now need to be careful and proportionate in terms of the way we manage things going forward."" The news comes as Boris Johnson announced that top Covid medic Sir Patrick Vallance will head up a new Science and Technology office to make Britain a science superpower. The PM will chair a new National Science and Technology Council to seize on the huge gains made by experts during the Covid crisis and put science and tech at the heart of Government policy. Mr Johnson said last night: ""From discovery to delivery, our vaccination programme has proven what the UK can achieve at scale and at speed. ""With the right direction, pace and backing, we can breathe life into many more scientific and technological breakthroughs that transform the lives of people across the UK and the world."""
200,200,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Boris Johnson to launch post-pandemic clean up of Britain with criminals scrubbing graffiti and Chewing Gum Taskforce,"BORIS Johnson will launch a post-pandemic tidy up of Britain with criminals scrubbing graffiti and chewing gum producers paying to clean streets. A new industry-funded Chewing Gum Taskforce will be unveiled this summer to direct cash to Town Halls to fix up blighted high streets. And The Sun can reveal ministers are finalising plans to use criminals on probation to pick up litter instead of undertaking unpaid work as well as scrub graffiti from railways and busses. Graffiti and gum on the streets said to be a pet peeves of the PM's with ministers told to ""pull every lever"" as part of a bid to get the nation ""sparkling"". One Downing Street insider told The Sun: ""whenever he is driving around the country on visits, he always remarks on the graffiti and mess and says more needs to be done."" The Taskforce is being led from No10 bringing in a wide range of Whitehall departments including the Environment, Communities and Justice. Industry sources say ministers threatened gum producers with taxation if they did not help voluntarily. But so far they have pledged just £2 million - far less than the £100 million needed to clean up the whole country. In 2010 Mr Johnson branded chewing gum ""an awful self-inflicted impetigo on the face of modern London, and it costs a fortune to treat."" ""The manufacturers spend only a couple of pennies to produce every stick or chiclet of gum, yet once they are gobbed on to the pavement and trodden flat by human traffic they adhere with such barnacle-like ferocity that they cost up to £1 each to remove."" Last night Downing Street refused to comment, but confirmed plans to get the high streets spring cleaned would be announced in due course."
201,201,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor","Aussie deal’s tariffic and it’s just the start, says Trade Secretary Liz Truss","LIZ TRUSS was on her fifth coffee of the morning after a night of negotiations with the Australians when Britain's first post-Brexit trade deal was sealed. ""Everyone's a winner"" she declared as she ushered The Sun into her Whitehall lair on Tuesday morning — just moments after Boris Johnson shook on the terms with visiting Aussie PM Scott Morrison in the No10 garden. Since Britain left the EU, ministers have been scrambling to ""roll over"" trade deals Brussels had with other countries — but yesterday's Aussie deal was brand new. The hyperactive Trade Secretary — nicknamed the Duracell bunny — had been up all night powered by wine and espresso as she hammered out the finer details of the historic accord that will save British households up to £34million a year, according to government statistics. ""This is our first post-Brexit deal that we've negotiated from scratch,"" she beamed – ""the first entirely British-shaped deal."" Britain and the Aussies have agreed to scrap all export and import taxes, but beef and lamb tariffs will be phased out over 15 years after a backlash from British farmers and some Cabinet ministers fearing a deluge of cheap meat exports. But the terms of the deal are a big win for the devout free trader Truss and will build on the £13.9billion of trade between the two countries last year. Sitting beneath a giant Australian flag, she hailed ""the most advanced deal Australia has signed, apart from with its closest neighbour New Zealand. ""It really reflects the closeness of our two countries, but it also shows the more outward-facing approach the UK has taken now we're negotiating our own trade deals."" Brexit naysayers said these sort of deals would never be done. Now they say the deal is poor and will do little to make up for lost trade with Brussels. Brexit convert Truss, who voted Remain in 2016, was having none of it. ""Take the North East of England. We're currently exporting 10,000 cars from the North East to Australia every year. And part of this deal is getting tariffs removed on that trade. ""It removes tariffs on all British goods, everything from cars to machinery and clothing."" And she pointed to the 450 businesses in Wales that exported to Australia last year insisting ""life science companies and chemicals manufacturers are set to benefit in particular"". Australia is also the world's eighth largest market for Scotch whisky exports, worth £113million last year. Truss insisted the agreement is a major boon for this industry, too. She says: ""We've also agreed measures to improve sales of Scotch whisky, so every part of the UK benefits from this deal, which will lead to more jobs."" Critics say the deal is small fry as it only boosts UK GDP by 0.02 per cent, but Truss disagrees. She says it is the ""keys"" to Britain's trade leaping on to the emerging markets of Asia. She adds: ""This deal opens the gateway to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which is a huge market. ""By 2030, 66 per cent of the world's middle classes are going to be in Asia, and that is where the opportunities for our farmers, Scotch producers and car markers lie."" Britain is in talks to join the TTP bloc of 11 countries, including Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan and New Zealand. Between them they produce £9trillion of GDP every year. Seeking membership is a key part of Britain's tilt away from Europe to making big trade gains in the East. ""It is a partnership for 500million consumers,"" she explains ""so more consumers than the EU, and they have rising demand for products like beef and lamb. ""This is all about our future opportunities."" But in recent months, Truss has been fighting a battle to get to these zero tariff terms. She was pitted against Environment Secretary George Eustice, who wanted to keep caps on the amount of agricultural goods the Aussies could sell to us. The Conservatives are split between free traders, such as Truss, and protectionists like Eustice, but after blazing Cabinet rows, Boris sided with the former. MPs have dubbed the warring tribes the ""Waitrose Tories"" who want to keep goods local but pricier, versus the ""Lidl Tories"" who want cheap bur- gers and sausages on shelves for the consu- mer to choose. Ever the diplomat, Truss insists ""I shop at both Wait- rose and Lidl"". She uses her local but-cher, too. She also resists the urge to gloat at her victory: ""The PM is a massive proponent of free trade. Of course, George is a winner too,"" she teased with a smirk, ""everyone is a winner"". Yet she has given ground on the transition phase, and admits: ""It's natural that there would be concerns in some quarters, but we have addressed those concerns with a very strong transition period to give our farmers time to adjust."" A Cabinet reshuffle is looming, and with this deal under her belt Truss is in a far stronger position than she was last time Boris rearranged his top team. But she did not shy away from reminding her boss: ""I'm loving this job and this Australia deal is just a start."" Then the Duracell Bunny was off again: ""This week I've got the New Zealand trade minister over for negotiations, the TTP is ready to negotiate."" And just in case Boris missed the subtleties there, she doubled down: ""I want to continue and get these other deals over the line, because this Australia deal is important in itself, but it's also part of a much bigger trade strategy."""
202,202,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson at odds with Joe Biden over whether Covid leaked from Wuhan lab,"BORIS Johnson is at odds Joe Biden over whether Covid leaked from Chinese lab. Asked by The Sun about the fears the bug escaped from a Wuhan research facility, the PM said: ""At the moment, the advice that we have had is that it doesn't look as though this particular disease of zoonotic origin came from a lab."" He added: ""Clearly, anybody sensible would want to keep an open mind about that."" However the US president did not scotch the claim, saying it was not yet certain whether or not ""a bat interfacing with animals and the environment caused this Covid-19, or whether it was an experiment gone awry in a laboratory"". G7 leaders yesterday renewed calls for a further investigation into the origin of the Covid pandemic amid questions over whether it leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. ""We haven't had access to the laboratories,"" Mr Biden told reporters. Speaking at the Cornish summit on Saturday, the head of the World Health Organisation, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that after almost 3.75 million deaths worldwide, people deserved to know the source of the outbreak. He told: ""We believe that all hypotheses should be open, and we need to proceed to the second phase to really know the origins."""
203,203,The Sun,Kate FergusonHarry Cole,Boris Johnson to push back Freedom Day by four weeks but plans to increase wedding guests cap,"BORIS Johnson will today extend lockdown for a month — but throw a lifeline to couples by increasing the wedding guests cap. The PM, who tied the knot with Carrie 16 days ago, is desperate not to ruin couples' happy day. Ministers were last night thrashing out plans to let more than 30 guests attend so long as they stick to social distancing. One said: ""There is hope a deal can be done."" Mr Johnson will offer up the deal as a glimmer of good news on a gloomy day for freedom-yearning Brits. He will confirm England's lockdown is extended to July 19, with an option of lifting it two weeks earlier. It comes as the number of Indian/Delta strain cases continues to shoot up. However, the PM would not promise the month-long delay would be the last. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, echoed his words and said no guarantee could be given as ""we are dealing with variants"". He told Times Radio that the country must not ""yo-yo back in and out of measures"". Conservative MPs and business chiefs hit out at the decision to extend lockdown. Rebel Steve Baker urged fellow Tories to oppose it. Issuing a Great Escape-style appeal, he wrote: ""It is the sworn duty of all officer to try to escape."" UK Hospitality chief Kate Nicholls said a month's delay would cost businesses £3billion and see 180,000 jobs lost. She said if one was necessary to meet vaccination targets, it should be ""full and final"". Infectious diseases specialist Dr Andrew Hayward said a substantial third wave of cases was starting to crash over the UK. He said opening up would ""fan the flames"", causing it to spread faster."
204,204,The Sun,Harry ColeKate Ferguson,Boris Johnson teased Emmanuel Macron at G7 about France’s dire record winning battles against the British Navy,"BORIS Johnson teased Emmanuel Macron in front of other world leaders about France's dire record winning battles against the British Navy, The Sun can reveal. The cheeky gag came as the final day of the G7 in sweltering Cornwall exploded into a row about Brexit and the pair traded bruising diplomatic blows. At the final session of the seaside summit, Mr Johnson joked to his fellow world leaders that he was a ""little heavy headed"" after some of them had stayed the night before. Mr Macron had bought some expensive red wine as a gift for Joe Biden, but leaders ended up tucking into it after the US President - nicknamed Sleepy Joe - headed to bed early. And BoJo blamed the strength of the wine for his sore head, saying the grog ""was as old as when the French last won a naval battle."" The dig came as Britain and France ramped up their war of words about Brexit, with Mr Macron telling Boris calm down and ""come back to reason"". In a cutting end of summit dig at the PM, the French President denied British claims he said Northern Ireland is not a proper part of the UK. Earlier livid Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab hit the airwaves to slam the ""offensive"" comments, saying: ""We have serially seen senior EU figures talk about Northern Ireland as if it was some kind of different country to the UK. ""It is not only offensive, it has real world effects on the communities in Northern Ireland, creates great concern, great consternation. Mr Raab added: ""Could you imagine if we talked about Catalonia, the Flemish part of Belgium, one of the lander in Germany, northern Italy, Corsica in France as different countries? ""We need a bit of respect here."" But Mr Macron hit back accusing the Brits of nearly wrecking the summit by stoking animosity with their briefings about EU threats to ban sausages being exported from the mainland to Northern Ireland. The cosy leaders summit in sunny Cornwall was dented by the furious row over the Brexit deal and what it means for chilled meats. The EU is refusing to relax rules so that tasty British bangers and burgers can be stocked in Ulster. As tensions mount, Britain is threatening to rip up parts of Brexit divorce terms and carry on stocking the great British banger in shops in NI despite the EU's sausage ban, which kicks in at the end of June. But Brussels has threatened a trade war if this happens. Raising the issue with Mr Macron in talks on Saturday, Mr Johnson asked the French leader: ""How would you like it if the French courts stopped you from moving Toulouse sausages to Paris?"" His French counterpart is said to have replied: ""That is not a good comparison because Toulouse and Paris are in the same country."" The pint-sized President said the EU is ""respectful of British sovereignty"" - but warned Britain must ""respect"" the Brexit deal and all the customs checks it carries with it. Asked about the sausage wars at the end of the summit in Cornwall, Mr Macron said: ""On that particular subject matter we all need to stay very calm"". Dropping the diplomatic pleasantries to deliver a tongue-lashing, he added: ""We can't create polemics and disagreements when we are meeting over three days. ""Let's not lose time in disagreements created in corridors or antechambers."" The angry French leader also suggested the EU is better off without the Brits. In a dig at the UK and Brexit, Mr Macron said: ""The EU demonstrated in the last four years that it is a political entity not just an economic entity… we can have certain interests and values we can pursue together and not be blocked by another partner."" At his own beachside press conference, Mr Johnson warned: ""Of course we make the point continuously we are part of one great, indivisible United Kingdom."" He added: ""What I am saying is that we will do whatever it takes to protect the territorial integrity of the UK, but actually what happened at this summit was there was a colossal amount of work on subjects that have absolutely nothing to do with Brexit."" Seeking to downplay the scale of the behind the scenes diplomatic dust-up, he hastily added: ""But actually what happened at this summit was there was a colossal amount of work on subjects that have absolutely nothing to do with Brexit."" Mr Johnson hailed his fellow leaders for pledging 1 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccine - either directly or through funding to the Covax initiative - to poor countries. The Prime Minister said this was made up of ""a massive contribution by the United States and other friends"", but one of his predecessors, Labour's Gordon Brown, said the G7 summit ""will go down as a missed opportunity"" due to the lack of a plan to deliver 11 billion vaccine doses. Mr Johnson told a news conference at the end of the G7 summit that ""we are going flat out and we are producing vaccines as fast as we can, and distributing them as fast as we can"". The target to vaccinate the world by the end of next year will be done ""very largely thanks to the efforts of the countries who have come here today"", Mr Johnson said. He said the UK's contribution to the 1 billion dose pledge is another 100 million vaccines from now to next June. SIR David Attenborough was the final national treasure wheeled out to impress world leaders. The environmentalist, 95, said in a video address: ""Tackling climate change is now as much a political and communications challenge as it is a scientific or technological one. ""We have the skills to address it in time. All we need is the global will to do so."" The leaders committed to back a ""green revolution""."
205,205,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson ‘will reveal June 21 lockdown lifting will be delayed until JULY 19’ on Monday after Delta variant surge,"BORIS Johnson will make a major announcement on Monday that June 21's lockdown lifting will be delayed until July 19, The Sun can reveal. A two-week review will be included meaning coronavirus restrictions could be dropped on July 5 if hospitalisations stay down. But sources told The Sun the chances of lifting restrictions as planned on June 21 were close to zero due to a 240 per cent surge in the Indian strain, now known as the Delta variant. This is a huge blow to Wembley's hosting of some crucial Euros matches. Group games will have a 25 per cent stadium cap - 22,500 fans - with that hopefully rising to around 45,000 people for the Semis and the July 11 Final. It had been hoped Wembley could be full of fully vaccinated or tested fans by then, but the delay to the last phase of the roadmap has scotched that. Running the big matches as pilots for Covid certification trials means the capacity numbers can be stretched, but there will still be thousands of seats left empty. Whitehall sources involved in the planning for the delay point to the fact that all UK adults will have been offered at least one jab by the end of July, with a short delay considered far better than having to U-turn and reintroduce restrictions. One source said: ""The last thing they need is a hokey cokey of in out, in out of restrictions. ""No one wants to go backwards, and we have to get this right first go."" The delay will be used to work out if the jab rollout really means rising cases numbers do not spark a surge in hospitalisations - and it will allow millions more people to be double jabbed.

Brits are two-thirds more likely to catch the variant from close contacts - with cases more than tripling in 11 days. Doubling rates for Delta infections were as high as 4.5 days in some parts of England. And 96 per cent of all cases are now due to the new strain. Experts found family members are 64 per cent more likely to be infected with the bug compared to the Alpha or Kent strain. And worrying research suggests the latest strain more than doubles risk of hospitalisation. However, patient numbers have grown at a much slower pace than cases – suggesting the vaccines are currently working to save lives. Just six per cent of all Delta variant infections were in people who had both jabs. More than half of the 42 deaths due to the mutation were in unvaccinated Brits. Dr Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said: ""With numbers of Delta variant cases on the rise across the country, vaccination is our best defence. ""If you are eligible, we urge you to come forward and be vaccinated. Remember that two doses provide significantly more protection than a single dose. In a very big public hint that a delay was coming, vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi warned against ""squandering those hard fought gains"" made by the jabs by lifting the last of the restrictions too soon. Mr Johnson is set to address the nation on Monday evening after making his final decision. No10 publicly insist that no final decision has been made, but privately key figures say any chance of going ahead in two weeks time are ""hanging by a very, very, very thin thread."""

Pubs and restaurants won't be able to open to full capacity, with the number of customers allowed in limited by social distancing rules, and table service remaining. It will mean still only six people can eat together inside, with gatherings of up to 30 people allowed outside. The limit on numbers allowed into arenas, cinemas, sporting events and theatres would also stay. Rules on face masks are expected to remain as they are, meaning they will still be needed on public transport and public venues inside. Nightclubs, which are all currently shut, would also have to stay completely closed - despite having planned to reopen on June 21. A return to the workplace would be pushed back, with workers expected to work from home for another month. Senior government sources have said a cap on the number of people at weddings is likely to remain - after officials from Matt Hancock's health department warned that they could become ""super-spreader"" events.

207,207,The Sun,Jack ElsomHarry ColeKate Ferguson,Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds elbow bump world leaders on G7 beach as Jill Biden jokes it’s ‘like a wedding!’,"BORIS Johnson and Carrie Symonds welcomed world leaders to the G7 summit in Cornwall this afternoon - with an elbow bump on the beach. One by one the cast of presidents and prime ministers swept down a boardwalk onto the sands of Carbis Bay with their partners to meet the host couple, with Jill Biden joking: ""It's like a wedding!"" Beaming Mr Johnson stood centre stage beside Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron as the group posed for their traditional - but socially distanced - ""family photo"" for the first time in two years. World leaders have converged on Cornwall for three days of crunch talks where they will draw up plans to fight coronavirus, climate change and global poverty. Opening the summit Mr Johnson told counterparts they should aim to ""building back greener and building back fairer and building back more equal and in a more gender neutral and, perhaps a more feminine way."" For his most important outing on the world stage since becoming PM, he wore a charcoal suit and light blue tie - but his trademark blonde mop was buffeted by a strong sea breeze as he stood on the beach. Carrie wore a hot pink mid-length dress from Roksanda, a female London based designer, along with LK Bennett shoes. After striding down a light wooden boardwalk with her husband, First Lady Biden joked: ""I feel like we are at a wedding"". Later Boris Johnson - who tied the knot less than a fortnight ago - remarked that it was like ""walking down the aisle."" President Biden urged assembled media to go swimming, quipping ""everyone in the water"". Reporters asked him what his message would be to Vladimir Putin, who he is meeting next week, and he replied ""I'll tell you after I have delivered it."" It turned out Carrie had spotted Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau swimming in the sea earlier this morning. Johnson had also gone for a tip in the bracing water off the Cornish coast at dawn. After the family photo of leaders, German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Mr Johnson ahead, telling him ""you are the leader"". But as Mr Johnson pressed ahead, President Macron took the opportunity to throw his arm around President Biden's shoulders and begin an animated discussion. His remarks were inaudible. The national leaders - as well as EU chiefs Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel - then sat around a locally-crafted table at the Carbis Bay hotel for the first round of talks. Chairing the meeting Mr Johnson opened: ""It's genuinely wonderful to see everybody in person, I can't say what a difference it makes."" As the G7 kicked off: Mr Johnson held sitdowns with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, Italian PM Mario Draghi and and Japanese PM Yoshihide Suga this morning. It followed a jovial inaugural meeting last night with US President Joe Biden, First Lady Jill and his new wife Carrie. Afterwards Mr Johnson hailed the transatlantic alliance as the ""indestructible relationship"". He also praised the Biden team as a ""breath of fresh air"", taking a swipe at Donald Trump who took a sledgehammer to diplomacy left the last G7 in carnage. The meeting also saw Downing Street baby Wilf venture onto the world stage, going for a paddle in the sea with his mum and Jill Biden, who gave him a copy of President Biden's kids book as a gift. French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and EU chief Ursula von der Leyen also jetted into Newquay Airport this morning. They risk hijacking the summit to collar Mr Johnson about UK threats to tear up parts of the Brexit deal to quell rising tensions in Northern Ireland. The PM yesterday blasted that ""excessively burdensome"" checks on goods arriving in the province - but said the G7 was not the place hammer out a solution. Mr Johnson instead wants to focus on ""building back better"" from the pandemic, unveiling his flagship pitch to ""vaccinate the world"" by 2022. He has called on fellow leaders to donate a billion jabs to poorer countries - and pledged 100million from Britain. Opening the summit, the Prime Minister said the G7 economies had the potential to ""bounce back very strongly"" from the crisis. He added: ""But it is vital that we don't repeat the mistake of the last great crisis, the last great economic recession of 2008 when the recovery was not uniform across all parts of society."" There was a risk the pandemic could leave a ""lasting scar"" as ""inequalities may be entrenched"", Mr Johnson said. ""We need to make sure that as we recover, we level up across our societies and we build back better,"" he added. After an afternoon of roundtable meetings the leaders will be treated to a lavish reception with the Queen at the Eden Project. They will be treated to locally-caught Turbot roasted on the bone with Cornish new potatoes and wild garlic pesto with greens. Looking to read more on the Prime Minister's life?

208,208,The Sun,Harry ColeKate Ferguson,Boris Johnson hails ‘great talks’ with Joe Biden after pair finally meet at G7 summit,"BORIS Johnson hailed US President Joe Biden as a ""breath of fresh air"" for the world after the Trump era as the new besties finally met in Cornwall yesterday. The Prime Minister and his new wife Carrie kicked off Britain's hosting of the G7 with a beachside love-in with the Americans. Mr Biden even joked that Boris was punching above his weight following his marriage to Carrie last month. He said: ""We have something in common — we both married way above our station."" Boris replied: ""I'm not going to disagree with the President there . . .  or indeed on anything else."" Mr Johnson held an 80-minute face-to-face chat with his American counterpart in Carbis Bay, Cornwall — covering Covid, climate and the Chinese and Russian menace. Meanwhile Carrie and First Lady Jill Biden bonded over tea. Carrie and Boris's baby Wilf even got his first foray into international diplomacy — stealing the show with his mop of blond hair just like dad. Mr Biden later said of the leaders' chat: ""We affirmed the special relationship — that is not said lightly — the special relationship between our people and renewed our commitment to defending the enduring democratic values that both our nations share."" Boris said ""the talks were great"" and ""went on for a long time"" as Britain stole the march on the rest of the world to be the first to meet Mr Biden in person since he took office in January. In a dig at Mr Biden's chaotic predecessor Donald Trump, Mr Johnson said: ""It's fantastic, it's a breath of fresh air."" And despite discussing a ""huge range of subjects"", No 10 said there was not the feared row over Northern Ireland many were expecting. We affirmed the special relationship — that is not said lightly — between our people. The Johnsons and the Bidens cemented their new friendship with an exchange of gifts. The Bidens gave cycle-mad Boris an American bike and helmet. Carrie was given a leather tote bag made by the wives of US troops, and a presidential silk scarf. The PM gave Mr Biden a framed photo of a mural of Frederick Douglass — a former slave and US abolitionist leader who travelled to Britain and Ireland in the 1840s. The First Lady was given a first edition of Daphne du Maurier's The Apple Tree — a collection of short stories. In the room, the pair discussed getting UK and US flights back in the skies and how to ""build back better"" together from the pandemic. Together they vowed to donate 600 million Covid vaccine doses to the world. Britain will hand over at least 100 million life-saving doses within the next year. The first five million jabs will be sent in the coming weeks. America said it will give away 500 million doses. Over the coming days, G7 leaders are expected to donate a billion doses of the vaccine to less developed countries. Mr Biden said Mr Johnson had led a ""strong campaign to get people vaccinated across the UK"". Meanwhile, despite fears of a row over Brexit, Mr Johnson last night insisted there was ""absolutely common ground"" over Northern Ireland. The US President's concerns over the way the UK Government is treating the terms of the deal with the EU threatened to overshadow the first meeting between the leaders. But following the talks, Mr Johnson said he was ""optimistic"" the peace process would be kept going. However, Mr Johnson did let rip over the case of Northampton teenager Harry Dunn. He reiterated Britain's desire to see justice after Anne Sacoolas, the wife of a US spy, fled under diplomatic immunity after the fatal 2019 crash. Today Mr Johnson will sit down with Canada, Japan and Italy as the full summit gets under way. In the evening he will deploy the Queen and Prince Charles, the Red Arrows and two of the nation's finest chefs to woo world leaders in a lavish dinner at the Eden Project. And the leaders and their wives will toast marshmallows on a fire pit while encouraged into a sea shanty singalong with Cornish band Du Hag Owr."
209,209,The Sun,Harry Cole,G7 leaders will enjoy informal barbecue complete with sea shanties and Red Arrows flypast,"BORIS Johnson will deploy the Queen, the Red Arrows and two of the nations' finest chefs as he woos world leaders this weekend. They will feast on Cornwall's finest food and soak up some of the county's culture during the G7 summit. At a lavish dinner at the Eden Project on Friday night they will feast on fish caught off the Cornish coast and cooked by Emily Scott, chef at the Watergate Bay hotel near Newquay. The Queen and Prince of Wales will join for a reception before the dinner. Saturday night's dinner will be a less formal affair, with the leaders tucking into a barbecue on the beach in Carbis Bay cooked by Simon Stallard, from the Hidden Hut in Portscatho. The Red Arrows will do a fly past and the leaders and their wives will toast marshmallows on a fire pit while encouraged into a Sea Shanty singalong. Local Shanty band Du Hag Owr will provide the musical accompaniment to the event, all washed down with Cornish sparkling wine, German Riesling, Australian Shiraz, Cornish beer and a ""hedgerow fizz cocktail""."

The chef and broadcaster, 81, has advised PM Boris Johnson on how to make hospital food more healthy. South African-born Prue moved to London in the 1960s and embarked on a hugely successful career in food. She was made an OBE in 1989 and a CBE in 2010. Prue took over from Mary Berry when Bake Off moved from the BBC to Channel 4 in 2017. She was married to author Rayne Kruger from 1974 until his death in 2002. In 2016 she wed retired designer John Playfair. Her son Danny Kruger is the Tory MP for Devizes, Wilts."
211,211,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson and Joe Biden will discuss reopening UK-US travel when they meet at G7,"BORIS Johnson and Joe Biden will put reopening UK-US travel top of the agenda when they finally meet today. The US President landed in Britain last night ahead of this weekend's G7 summit in Cornwall — on his first foreign visit in office. Air Force One touched down at RAF Mildenhall, Suffolk, just before 8pm where Mr Biden, 78, and his wife Gill, 70, addressed US troops as they began their eight-day trip to Europe. Mr Biden said his visit would show that ""the United States is back"" and democracies are standing together. He added that as founding members of Nato, the US and UK were part of the ""strongest military and political alliance in history"" — but warned it needed to be ""modernised"" to protect against new challenges. He is set to meet Mr Johnson today when they will discuss resuming flights. They were stopped more than 400 days ago because of the pandemic. The leaders will also forge a post-Brexit accord focusing on global health, climate change and Covid recovery. It will mirror the Atlantic Charter signed in 1941 by the then British PM and US President, Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Mr Johnson said: ""While Churchill and Roosevelt faced the question of how to help the world recover following a devastating war, today we have to reckon with a very different but no less intimidating challenge — how to build back better from the coronavirus pandemic. ""Co-operation between the UK and US, the closest of partners and the greatest of allies, will be crucial for the future of the world's stability and prosperity."" PRESIDENT Biden would be a disaster for Britain, gleeful Remainers claimed. His Irish ancestry left him ill-disposed to us. He hated Brexit and loved the EU, which he would always prioritise. The US would never do a trade deal with us. Worse still, the Democrats disliked Boris, who was just Donald Trump with a British accent. And so on and so on. Now, after months of warmth, the two leaders will today forge a historic new transatlantic pact. Do the Boris-haters call anything right? Mr Biden, who will meet the Queen at Windsor after the summit, has said one aim of his trip was to show China and Russia that the Western alliance is strong. He will leave the UK for Brussels for talks with EU and Nato chiefs, before meeting Russia's Vladimir Putin. Heads of state from France, Germany, Canada, Italy and Japan will also be at the G7 summit at Carbis Bay."
212,212,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Boris Johnson vows to make Cornwall Britain’s first carbon neutral area,"BORIS Johnson will vow to make the West Country Britain's first carbon neutral area. The PM unveiled his idea yesterday ahead of the G7 summit in Cornwall. As a cash boost to help the area become Britain's greenest region was announced, the PM said: ""As the eyes of the world look to Cornwall this week, not only will they see an area of outstanding beauty, they will witness a region that is innovative, exciting and looking firmly towards a bright future. ""As the world builds back better from coronavirus, Cornwall will lead the way."" Mr Johnson wants to persuade other leaders at the summit to follow Britain's lead and adopt a green recovery plan to decarbonise the globe in less than 30 years post-Covid. The UK has already set the world's most ambitious target to slash emissions by 78 per cent by 2035 compared with 1990 levels. And the aim is to be entirely carbon neutral by 2050. MAKING simple everyday changes can add up to a BIG difference to the planet. And we want you and your family to join The Sun's Green Team - our eco revolution. It can feel overwhelming to know how to play a part in reducing greenhouse gasses, but we will be showing you the practical steps we can take to curb climate change - with the help of the global 'Count Us In' initiative. And our easy measures will even help you SAVE money so your household budget goes further. We'll help you to reduce food waste, insulate your home, create tasty planet-friendly meals and take simple steps to trim your carbon footprint. We want you to go online to sign-up to as many of our special Green Team pledges as you can manage and a special calculator will show you how much carbon you will personally save. It won't cost you a penny but the total you and your family will save will be added to the global 'Count Us In' total and the platform will support you every step of the way. So tap here to pledge. Mr Johnson will meet US President Joe Biden tomorrow for their first face-to-face chat before meeting the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan when the three-day summit starts on Friday. The leaders and their wives will also visit areas of outstanding beauty in the region and forge a plan on how to roll out Covid jabs for the world's needy. Visit Cornwall estimates more than £50million will be injected into the county as a result of hosting the summit and a resulting tourism spin-off. DOES the PM think his ""net zero"" revolution will happen by magic? That his arbitrary deadlines and grand announcements will simply come true? In fact they threaten acute financial pain for millions. The Sun is campaigning for a greener planet. But it's all very well Boris declaring, before the G7 summit, that Cornwall will be the first county to hit zero emissions. Have its people been told what that actually means? Unaffordable battery cars, capable only of short trips. Punitive gas bills. Their reliable central heating stripped out and replaced at their expense. Do not just impose all this on Britain, PM. You must take voters with you. And if you make them poorer, expect flak."
213,213,The Sun,Harry ColeJonathan ReillyTracey Boles,Secret plan to delay lockdown lift by TWO WEEKS but Boris Johnson is battling to save June 21 freedom day,"PUB giants and football fans have urged PM Boris Johnson to stay firm on his pledge to lift lockdown on June 21. Their battle cry came amid fears that any delays could plunge England's hosting of the Euros into chaos. Ministers and officials are working on contingency plans to move ""Freedom Day"" to next month, as well as retaining distancing and limits on fans in stadiums. But World Cup 1966 winner George Cohen, 81, said: ""Boris has to stick with June 21. Our boys need those England fans in the pubs and in the stadiums. ""It gave us such a boost in 1966 and it'll give them a huge boost again. What's the point of home advantage if our fans can't roar us to the final."" The tournament starts on Friday, with the Three Lions' first game against Croatia next Sunday. The final group game against Czech Republic is on June 22 and would allow pubs to fill to pre-Covid levels and repeat the scenes of Euro 1996, also held in England. By the time Wembley hosts the Euros semis and the July 11 final, it is hoped even more fans will be able to attend in person. Meanwhile, Kate Nicholls, of UK Hospitality warned that even a two-week delay to ending lockdown would cost the industry £1.5billion. She added: ""This needs to be a full and final unlocking. Our businesses  are running out of road, particularly given Government  support is withdrawn from  June 30."" Emma McClarkin, of the British Beer & Pub Association, said pubs remain unviable without a total removal of restrictions. Greene King said if they are not lifted, it would lose £1million of trade for every England  game — rising to ten times that if the Three Lions reach the semis and final. Chief exec Nick Mackenzie said it was ""incredibly important"" the Government stick to its plan. This would allow for standing at the bar to order and not having to wear masks walking around the pub, plus groups of more than six and mixing between households. Mr Mackenzie added: ""After the year we've had, and the millions the industry has invested in making pubs safe  any delay would be a devastating blow. ""Bringing people together to watch the game on the big screen is what we do. Being able to do that again this summer will give us a fighting chance of rebuilding after a crippling 15 months."" Those in favour of a delay argue it would allow more Brits to get at least their first jab. Ministers and medics would also have more time to study data, with infections worryingly back at March levels. Yesterday saw 11 new deaths and 6,238 cases recorded.  This compares with ten deaths and 4,182 cases the previous Friday. A total of 66,749,638 Brits have now been jabbed. Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said Wales will stick to ""our own timetable"" on June 21, whatever happens in England. The PM is holding firm on the date. But ministers fear June 21 will be too soon to ""definitively"" prove  the jab has broken the link between cases and hospitalisations. ""Professor Lockdown"" Neil Ferguson has warned the Indian variant could yet be 100 per cent more transmissible than other strains. He said Mr Johnson had a ""very difficult judgment call"" on whether to unlock in 16 days. The crucial R rate is also as high as 1.2 according to Sage — meaning the virus is up again. Public Health England said 278 people with the Indian variant attended A&Es in England last week, resulting in 94 overnight admissions. This compares with 201 A&E attendances in the previous week, with 43 admissions. However most admissions continue to be people who have not been vaccinated, according to PHE. The average number of admissions a day in Covid-hotspot East Lancashire, based on a seven-day rolling average, stands at five — the highest since mid-March. A Cabinet source said of contingency plans: ""I can't say we are not preparing for it, but we are not there quite yet."" A senior aide added: ""We have to wait for the data before a final decision.  Of course, conversations are ongoing about a potential Plan B, as you'd expect. But we hope we don't have to use it."" A government figure told Sky News ""It would be remiss of us to take a decision without a full set of data as evidence. ""Of course officials are drawing up other options but we are still expecting to be in a place to go ahead on June 21."" Mr Johnson has vowed to give businesses and the public at least a week's notice, meaning a decision on June 14 at the latest. It comes as: A Government source insisted: ""We always knew that cases would go up as we unlocked at each stage, but the crucial question is whether this then results in hospitalisations, or whether vaccines are providing the protection we need. ""We'll have to watch the data closely over the next week before making a final decision, as we have done at each step."" Experts today warned the Indian Covid mutation could be 100 per cent more infectious than the Kent variant, which caused the country to lockdown in January. Professor Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, whose modelling was instrumental to the UK locking down in March 2020 said vaccines are helping, but warned the Indian variant is spreading. Speaking to BBC radio 4's Today Programme he said: ""There's some uncertainty around that depending on assumption and how you analyse the data, between about 30 per cent and maybe even up to 100 per cent more transmissible."" The rise in cases has resulted in mounting pressure from scientists to hold back. Earlier this week, Boris Johnson hinted he would still press on with plans to end lockdown this month - despite warning the decisive data was still ""ambiguous"". It comes as official figures showed Covid cases in England have soard 75 per cent in seven days to 86,000 last week. The UK is at the ""start of a Covid epidemic in the young"", according to data, as hotspots threaten the lockdown lifting on June 21. Government advisers at Sage today said the R rate in England is now 1.0 to 1.2. Last week Sage said the value was 1.0 to 1.1. An R rate below 1.0 is favoured because it means that the outbreak is still shrinking. It peaked on January 15 at between 1.2 and 1.3, came down to a low of 0.6 to 0.8 in mid-March, before creeping up again over the past few weeks since Brits were given more freedoms. There are fears the Indian variant and a mutated version of the strain, dubbed the ""Nepal variant"" will force ""Freedom Day"" to be delayed, after cases doubled in a week. A UK Government spokeswoman said ""no decision"" had been made on whether to ease all coronavirus restrictions on June 21, amid reports Boris Johnson could delay the move by at least a fortnight. ""As the Prime Minister has set out, we can see nothing in the data at the moment to suggest that we need to deviate from the roadmap,"" said the spokeswoman. ""We continue to look at the data and the latest scientific evidence and no decision on Step 4 has yet been made."" But teens aged 12 to 15 will be able to sign up to get a Pfizer vaccine when their slot comes to get jabbed - after approval was confirmed today. Prof James Naismith, Director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute, and University of Oxford, said: ""There are two factors at play here, once is the easing of the lockdown measures in May and the second is the delta variant (which has now become dominant). ""The trajectory of the case numbers in the North West are particularly worrying. East Midlands appears on a similar track. ""We are seeing some evidence for an increase in hospitalisation where the case numbers are highest. Without vaccines, we would seem to be a the start of a third wave and given the nature of the delta, such a third wave could have been particularly disastrous. ""It is worth pausing to remember that if it is as transmissible and severe as early data indicate the delta variant will devastate less developed countries. I am filled with dread and sorrow for what lies ahead."""
214,214,The Sun,Ellie CambridgeHarry Cole,Pfizer Covid jab is approved for kids in UK in boost to vaccine blitz as ‘epidemic in young strikes’,"BRITISH teens can now get the Pfizer Covid vaccine - as the jabs rollout speeds on to beat the variants. The UK's medicine regulator MHRA has approved use of coronavirus shots for youngsters, in a bid to get as many people protected as possible. It comes as fears the Indian variant and a mutated version of the strain, dubbed the ""Nepal variant"" will force June 21's ""Freedom Day"" to be delayed. Teens aged 12 to 15 will be able to sign up to get a Pfizer vaccine when their slot comes to get jabbed. Dr June Raine, MHRA Chief Executive said: ""We have carefully reviewed clinical trial data in children aged 12 to 15 years and have concluded that the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective in this age group and that the benefits of this vaccine outweigh any risk. ""We have in place a comprehensive safety surveillance strategy for monitoring the safety of all UK-approved COVID-19 vaccines and this surveillance will include the 12- to 15-year age group. ""No extension to an authorisation would be approved unless the expected standards of safety, quality and effectiveness have been met. ""It will now be for the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to advise on whether this age group will be vaccinated as part of the deployment programme."" It comes as: Prof Adam Finn, Professor of Paediatrics, University of Bristol, said: ""As expected, MHRA have authorised the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine from the age of 12 years as FDA and EMA have done previously. ""This permits the vaccine to be used in this age group but does not decide whether or not to do so and, if it is decided to do so, which adolescents to offer it to and when. ""The key question to address now is whether it is actually necessary to immunise children in order to protect them from the infection (or whether vaccinating adults only would be sufficient to control spread of infection as seen in Israel) and in order to prevent further disruption to their education and social development. ""Reports of cases of delta variant infection in schools this week are clearly of concern in this context."" It comes as the UK is at the ""start of a Covid epidemic in the young"", according to data, and hotspots threaten the lockdown lifting on June 21. As millions of people under 30 wait for their jab, infections are spreading rapidly, according to new data. Prof Tim Spector, a genetic epidemiologist at King's College London who leads the ZOE study, said: ""The data highlights that the increase is happening in the younger age groups, suggesting the start of an epidemic in the young. ""We can't be too complacent, and we are monitoring things closely."" Israel started giving out vaccines to kids in January, and the US rolled out Moderna to 12-15 year olds in May. NHS plans leaked to The Sun revealed British kids as young as 12 could get Covid jabs when schools reopen. Ministers have secured an extra 60 million doses of the Pfizer jab to ensure there are enough to cover children as part of an autumn immunisation blitz. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said the NHS will be ""ready"" to jab youngster if given the green light. Former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt had asked in the Commons: ""Is it time to look at vaccinating the over-12s as they are doing in the US?"" Mr Zahawi replied: ""We will operationally be ready, but ultimately the decision has to be a clinical one."" It comes after an expert warned people under the age of 21 may be more vulnerable to the Indian coronavirus variant. Prof Neil Ferguson, Imperial College London, revealed there is a ""signal"" in the data that it's spreading quicker among younger age groups. Speaking at a German press briefing, he said it is not clear if this is because the variant has a biological advantage. Instead it may be a result of the environment - for example, younger people are not vaccinated. ""There's a hint in the data that under-21s are slightly more likely to be infected with this variant compared with other variants in recent weeks in the UK"", Prof Ferguson said Moderna said trials involving 3,732 children aged 12-17 found none fell ill with the virus after two shots. And infections fell by 93 per cent after just one dose. The ""exciting"" result suggests the jab is highly effective at stopping Covid transmission. Prof Russell Viner, at UCL, said the Moderna results are ""encouraging"", adding it shows mRNA jabs appear to be as effective in teens. ""mRNA vaccines appear to be broadly safe in teenagers, with both Moderna and Pfizer reporting no safety concerns,"" he said."
215,215,The Sun,Harry ColeNick Gutteridge,Green list confirmed: NO new countries added and Portugal moved to amber list in holiday blow for millions of Brits,"BRITS saw their summer holiday hopes dashed tonight after ministers confirmed they're adding NO new countries to the green travel list. Transport secretary Grant Shapps made the shock announcement that he isn't opening up any more destinations for quarantine-free trips. Instead extra places have been included on the red list, meaning Brits will be officially banned from going there as of 4am on Tuesday. And in a double whammy Portugal has been turned amber following an uptick in cases. Ministers said the move was taken to protect the UK against a potentially dangerous new mutation of the Indian variant. Mr Shapps said: ""The public has always known travel will be different this year. ""We must continue to take a cautious approach to reopening international travel in a way that protects public health and the vaccine rollout. ""While we are making great progress in the UK with the vaccine rollout, we continue to say the public should not travel to destinations outside the green list."" Seven countries - Afghanistan, Bahrain, Costa Rica, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Sudan, and Trinidad & Tobago - are now on the red list. Health Security Agency chief Dr Jenny Harries said: ""Increases in case rates in the UK serve as a reminder that this pandemic is not over yet and we need to take a cautious approach. ""Everyone should observe the travel guidance, continue to follow hands, face, space and fresh air, and have both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine when offered. ""Testing will help to break chains of transmission and allow us to see which variants are circulating so make sure you get tested when you return to the UK in line with the guidance."" The move will spark chaos for holiday plans means there are now no major destinations on the green list. It comes as a huge blow to desperate sun seekers and the battered travel industry. There had been hopes favourite holiday hotspots including Malta and many Greek islands could be opened up for holidays. Finland and Poland were also thought to be in line for the green list due to their low Covid rates. The announcement came after Boris Johnson warned he'd have ""no hesitation"" over yanking countries off the green list if necessary. And in a blow to hols hopes the EU has left Britain off its new safe travel list due to fears over the spread of the Indian variant. The PM said: ""We are going to try and allow people to travel as I know many people want to, but we've got to be cautious. ""We've got to continue to put countries on the red list, on the amber list, when that is necessary. ""We will have no hesitation in moving countries from the green list to the amber list to the red list if we have to do so. ""The priority is to continue the vaccine rollout to protect the people of this country."" Home office minister Victoria Atkins urged Brits to show ""common sense"" when travelling this summer. She said: ""We have to look at the data, at what is happening elsewhere in the world, to help advise the public as to what is allowed and not allowed. ""But as with anything, we're asking the public to exercise their common sense and that is the way that we're going to be able to return to normality."" Ahead of the announcement holiday hotspot Cyprus had expressed hopes it would be added to the green list. The island's tourism minister Savvas Perdios said: ""Cyprus absolutely deserves to be green-listed. ""We are one of the few countries in Europe that has been so open to the UK in terms of travelling."" Travel expert Paul Charles insisted other popular destinations also ""really deserve"" to make the cut. They include the Greek islands of Zante, Rhodes and Kos, the Caribbean islands of Grenada and Antigua, plus Malta and Finland. He fumed: ""This is a decision which will threaten tens of thousands of jobs in the aviation and travel sectors, not to mention further damage consumer confidence. ""The data shows several countries should be green so the Government's decision beggars belief. Summer is being squeezed by a policy of fear."" People returning to the UK from green locations are not required to self-isolate, and only need to take one test after getting home. Most countries, including popular hotspots such as Spain, France, Italy and Greece are on the amber list. Everyone coming back from those areas must quarantine at home for 10 days and take two post-arrival tests. Countries are graded on criteria including infection rates, reliability of data, and the presence of variants of concern. Ability to identify new strains of the virus and the extent of vaccine rollout is also taken into account. The announcement comes amid concerns the spread of the Indian variant could force the PM to push back the June 21 end of lockdown. Boris yesterday insisted there's ""nothing in the data"" yet to suggests the great reopening up will need to be paused. But there are reports ministers are drawing up contingency plans for a two-week delay if the rate of new infections passes 5,000 a day. A Whitehall source told the FT: ""No one wants this to go on longer than necessary. ""But there's a sense that everyone could live with an extra two weeks if it keeps the new strain under control."" No 10 still holds out hope that the lightning rollout of the vaccine, which is effective against the Indian variant, will keep the roadmap on track. A whopping 75% of adults across the UK have now had their first coronavirus jab, and half have received both doses."
216,216,The Sun,Ben LeoSarah RidleyHarry Cole,Brits enjoy beers in 28C sunshine on year’s hottest day as 75% of UK adults now jabbed in yet another vaccine milestone,"THE big staycation was hotting up yesterday as it hit 28C and punters threatened to drink pubs dry. Sunseekers basked on the hottest day of the year so far, and so much beer was sunk that breweries were racing to refill kegs. Meanwhile the UK hit yet another glorious vaccine milestone. Three-quarters of adults have now been jabbed, and Boris Johnson promised we were still on course for Freedom Day on June 21. It all means the country is on track to enjoy a bright and breezy summer after 15 months of tight adherence to Covid restrictions. Despite warnings from doom-mongering scientists, the PM could see ""nothing in the data"" to suggest the long-awaited final stage of unlocking cannot go ahead. The good news came as Brits basked in 28C temperatures — making us warmer than ten countries on the Government's approved ""green list"" of overseas destinations. That gets updated today, but many Brits are unfussed at the prospect of going abroad. Andy Nicholson, 29, visiting a busy Blackpool Pier with his family, said: ""We're having a brilliant day. Who needs foreign holidays when you get days like this? ""We don't think we'll get away this year but there's no reason to when the UK is warmer than most of the countries on the green list. It's brilliant."" Temperatures hit 28.3C (82.94F) in Northolt, West London, ensuring it was the year's hottest day so far. Who needs foreign holidays when you get days like this? The two previous warmest were on Monday and Tuesday. The post-bank holiday heatwave saw Brits flock to beaches, parks and pub gardens around the country. It swelled the UK's raging thirst for beer, with 70million pints a week now being downed since Covid pub restrictions were eased last month. Demand has been so high that some brewers, including Heineken, were running out of kegs to keep up. Landlords were also steeling themselves for the Euro football tournament starting next week, when pubs will be packed for three weeks solid. Greg Grundy, who runs The Egremont pub in Worthing, West Sussex, said: ""The reopening of pubs was mad and the warm weather has seen an additional surge. ""Now we have the perfect storm of the Euros starting next week, where pubs will be packed to the rafters with football fans. ""We're ploughing through plenty of stock but we can't get rid of the kegs quick enough to get more in. ""The kegs are normally collected once a week but that's now ramped up to twice a week."" Heineken last night reassured drinkers that supply will be met. It said: ""We've asked our pub customers to make sure all empty kegs are returned so that we can quickly recycle and refill them, and get them back out to pubs as quickly as possible."" In a bid to keep pumps flowing, landlords are now being offered mega-kegs of beer in huge 100 litre containers. They are normally reserved for big events such as horse race meetings and festivals. As the country sweltered, former England football captain David Beckham went topless for a countryside stroll with wife Victoria. The 46-year-old posted a picture to his 66.6 million followers on Instagram, and said: ""Yep this is England, it's what we do, (sun) comes out we take our shirts off, even walking the dogs when Victoria is laughing at me."" Others chose to cool off in the sea yesterday — the seventh successive day to top 21C (70F). Beaches were rammed around the country as families took advantage of the half-term break, with thousands flocking to Margate, Kent. Paddle-boarders filled the sea at Birling Gap, East Sussex, while surfers took to the waves at Perranporth, Cornwall. Hopes of Freedom Day going ahead as planned were boosted by figures showing 75 per cent of adults have now had one jab — with 50 per cent receiving both. Thousands more were inoculated yesterday, including doses administered at a Glasgow car park. The Prime Minister played down gloomy warnings from scientists, insisting an increase in cases was to be expected after lockdown was eased. He said: ""We always knew that was going to happen. What we need to work out is to what extent the vaccination programme has protected enough of us, particularly the elderly and vulnerable, against a new surge."" He insisted ""every day we're having long sessions interrogating the data, looking at the models"" ahead of a crunch decision on 14 June. It came as one of Britain's leading doctors appeared to criticise fellow medics who want the end of lockdown delayed amid fears about the Indian variant. FROM loo rolls to our liberty, Brits have endured no end of deprivations over the past 15 months with grit and humour. But there is one shortage the national spirit cannot stomach: the lack of a pint of beer in our newly reopened pubs, especially now the sunshine is here. Landlords and brewers must rise to the occasion and keep the kegs rolling. Sir John Bell warned of a never-ending lockdown scenario whenever a new form of the virus was identified. He told the BBC: ""If we scamper down a rabbit hole every time we see a new variant, we're going to spend a long time huddled away."" The Regius Professor of Medicine at the University of Oxford said he was ""pretty encouraged"" by the latest data but said ministers were right to wait before taking decisions."
217,217,The Sun,Natasha ClarkHarry Cole,Carrie Symonds becomes first Mrs Johnson after taking Boris Johnson’s last name,"CARRIE Symonds became the first Mrs Johnson at the weekend after PM Boris married for the third time. The bride opted to take her new husband's name following a Catholic ceremony, which sparked some anger, whereas his first two wives kept their maiden names. Carrie, 33, who is understood to be a practising Catholic, and the 56-year-old Prime Minister tied the knot in a private ceremony in the Lady Chapel at Westminster Cathedral. They will have a big celebration bash next July, as The Sun revealed last week. The pair will also take their official honeymoon then at an as-yet undecided destination. The pair slipped out of No10 yesterday afternoon to start a two-day ""mini-moon"" but the PM will be back at work tomorrow. Saturday's ceremony was officiated by Father Daniel Humphreys who baptised the couple's son, Wilfred, one, in the Lady Chapel six months ago. Mr Johnson was previously married to his university girlfriend Allegra Mostyn-Owen, 56, for six years and to Marina Wheeler, also 56, for 27 years. The couple, who had four children, finalised their divorce last year. Disgruntled Catholics questioned why the twice-divorced Prime Minister was permitted to have a Catholic ceremony. Some worshippers at Westminster were ""confused"" because the Catholic church does not usually permit remarriage if a former spouse, or spouses, are still alive. EVER the optimist, Boris Johnson was undeterred by the failure of his first two marriages as he tied the knot with Carrie Symonds. In his crisp white shirt and dark suit, the adoring husband looked slightly smarter than usual, though his hair was in the usual wild style. Chaos is part of his character and it is also central to his popular appeal. Much of the public love him precisely because he is full of authentic imperfections and eccentricities. This marriage will be good for him, serving as an anchor in No10. Nearly all the most successful PMs have had strong marriages. Carrie has personally been through a tough time, due to Covid, feuds in No10 and political scandals, like the row over redecoration costs for Downing Street. Now she may feel more secure. The happy couple deserve congratulations at the start of this adventure. The omens are good. The last Prime Minister to marry in office, the 2nd Lord Liverpool, was the longest serving premier of the 19th century. Looking to read more on the Prime Minister's life? We have you covered... Elizabeth Pierce, 68, said: ""I don't understand. Once you're married, that's it."" The rector of St Paul's in Deptford, South East London, Father Paul Butler, tweeted: ""Always one Canon law for the rich and one for the poor."" The Cathedral said later that the couple were both parishioners and baptised Catholics. A spokesman said: ""All necessary steps were taken, in both Church and civil law, and all formalities completed before the wedding."" Matt Chinery, Ecclesiastical and Canon Lawyer, said the church had not recognised Mr Johnson's first two marriages, so the third ceremony was permitted. Several high-profile guests had been seen outside Westminster Cathedral shortly before the wedding, arousing suspicion among passers-by. WITH two failed marriages behind him, many will scoff that Boris Johnson's latest union is doomed and predict that Carrie Symonds will be crying into her pillow quicker than you can say ""reshuffle"". However, Boris, 56, has the opportunity to learn from his mistakes after marrying Allegra Mostyn-Owen at 23 — and then Marina Wheeler at 29. In Carrie he has found a woman who clearly understands his world. As the former Tory communications director, she has a passion for politics and understands the intricacies of Whitehall. Boris will be able to confide in her — much as Margaret Thatcher had the unwavering support of Denis. That should not be mistaken for subservience. She is comfortable taking Boris on, berating him for spilling red wine on her sofa and accusing him of being ""spoiled"". The challenge for such strong-minded individuals will come with the need to compromise. But if they keep communicating and supporting each other, I see no reason why they shouldn't remain happily united. After all, they do say third time lucky. Insiders said the ceremony was a traditional affair from start to finish and included several Bible readings and an extract from the Song of Songs. It is understood that the couple's vows were not personalised. Mr Johnson became the first PM to marry in office since Lord Liverpool in 1822. GUESTS danced into the night to music played by a London acoustic trio. The Bow Fiddlies cover the likes of Ed Sheeran's Shape of You, Avicii's Wake Me Up and Mumford and Sons' hit I Will Wait. They also play a version of Coolio's Gangsta's Paradise and a rendition of George Michael's 1980s smash hit Faith. It has previously earned them gigs at venues including London's Royal Albert Hall and New York's Carnegie Hall. And last night they added Downing Street to that list. They were spotted leaving Number 10 with instruments — and a story to tell."
218,218,The Sun,Natasha ClarkHarry Cole,Boris Johnson’s wedding secrets revealed from Carrie’s £45 rented dress to the honeymoon,"CHIC bride Carrie rented a designer hippy dress for her wedding to Boris Johnson — for just £45. The Prime Minister, 56, wearing a suit and Tory blue tie, and the new Mrs Johnson, 33, tied the knot in a top-secret ceremony on Saturday, May 29, 2021. The couple slipped out of Downing Street yesterday afternoon to take a two-day ""mini-moon"" by the seaside. Thirty guests piled into the Downing Street garden for a folky singalong to celebrate Boris Johnson tying the knot with Carrie. They partied around a fire pit until the small hours of Sunday after the PM's top-secret wedding on Saturday. The couple, who got hitched at Westminster Cathedral, will celebrate again with a huge bash for all their friends and family in July 2022, as we revealed last week. The Sun can also exclusively reveal today: Wedding photographs released last night showed the smiling bride in a floor-length, long-sleeved, white gown. Her blonde locks were curled, complete with an intricate flower crown made from yellow roses and white daisies. The embroidered tulle number has now completely sold out online. The newlyweds posed for a set of snaps in the Downing Street garden after the ceremony, with Boris in a dark navy suit and blue tie. Carrie also shared a snap of the couple on Instagram last night, taken by photographer Rebecca Fulton,. She said she was ""very, very happy"" and thanked her followers for their ""very kind"" wishes. To the shock of No10 aides the long-awaited day had been in the diary for months, with all attendees sworn to secrecy. Guests were ordered not to speak to anyone and last night remained tight-lipped about the precise details of the couple's hippie-style celebration. The Sun can reveal that Boris chose his closest brother Leo to stand by his side as best man, and fellow siblings Jo, Julia and Rachel were in attendance too. Both the bride and groom's mothers joined the celebration, but Carrie's father Matthew Symonds did not. Last night a spokesperson for the couple declined to comment on whether he was invited. It's also thought that none of Boris' four grown-up children were there to see their father re-marry. Other close friends including Nimco Ali and Anna Pinder were rumoured to be on the guest list for the lavish bash. The couple's much-loved Jack-Russell cross dog Dilyn made an enthusiastic appearance at the afterparty but was kept out of the church. Guests were treated to a 'best of British' afternoon tea and drinks following the service. And folk-band called The Bow Fiddlies was on hand to drum up a medley of tunes throughout the afternoon and evening, taking requests from the couple and guests - including hits by Mumford and Sons. Although there was no official ""first dance"", the group sang and danced around a fire pit until the early hours of the morning, leaving by the backdoor at around 1.30am. Looking to read more on the Prime Minister's life? We have you covered... The couple decked out the traditionally posh Downing Street back garden, usually used for events and hosting dignitaries. Festival-style decorations including multi-coloured bunting was hung from trees, with several hay bales, flowers and a range of cocktails on offer. Bride Carrie was even pictured barefoot to complete the vibe. But guests were told not to take photographs for fear of the news leaking out. The rented dress makes the 'something borrowed' and the PM picked a power blue tie for the big event as his 'something blue'. No Tory MPs or cabinet ministers were thought to have made the guest list for the bash. Last night there was upset in the Tory party that no ministers or MPs managed to secure an invite to the most sought-after wedding of the year. The guest list was capped thanks to the PM's own lockdown rules which dictate that only 30 people can attend weddings at the moment. EXCLUSIVE by Julia Atherley THE Catholic priest who married Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds said it was quiet and dignified. Father Daniel Humphreys also baptised their baby son Wilfred in a private service last year. The acting administrator of Westminster Cathedral said yesterday: ""It was lovely. I'm not going to say too much but it all went well. It was very quiet but a very dignified occasion."" The secret ceremony, which took some aides by surprise, has been planned for six months, with Fr Humphreys one of the few trusted to keep the details under wraps. Writing previously in a church newsletter, Fr Humphreys said his interests include ""history, theatre, a little bit of politics"". He is also a keen Arsenal fan who enjoys ""singing and playing piano and organ"". After June 21 the cap is expected to be ripped up, allowing unlimited numbers to big bash wedding celebrations. Some thought there could be a reception party later in the year for politicians to heal some of the upset among the PM's colleagues. Cabinet ministers expressed a complete surprise at a lack of invite to the close-knit ceremony and said it was ""bad party management"". By Liam Coleman PM Boris Johnson's best man was his shy younger brother Leo. He is a co-presenter of Radio 4 series Future Proofing and co-founder of advisory firm Sustainable Finance, part of professional services group PwC. Leo went to Oxford, like his siblings, and in 2015 his sister Rachel, 55, said he was the ""perfect mix of Michael York and Jeff Bridges"". She said at the time: ""He walked into a London hotel recently and every woman looked round."" Leo also founded an organic wine company from his home in North London six years ago. Also seen at No10 yesterday was Boris' close pal Hugo Dixon, 57, a journalist and the ex-editor-in-chief of the financial commentary website Breakingviews. Dixon and Boris are childhood friends and the pro-European has previously spoken about his divide over Brexit with pal Mr Johnson."
219,219,The Sun,Harry ColeJack Elsom,Dominic Cummings brands Boris Johnson ‘unfit for the job’ and says ‘tens of thousands died who didn’t need to’,"VENGEFUL Dominic Cummings savaged Boris Johnson today in a jaw-dropping Commons tirade — telling a Covid inquiry the PM was unfit for office and claiming his dithering killed thousands. The former aide also admitted not telling the whole truth about his infamous trip to Durham, where he claimed he broke lockdown rules to test his eyesight. But some accused Mr Cummings of seeking revenge over his No10 ousting. Last night a former colleague branded him a ""disingenuous little f*****"". Mr Cummings lifted the lid on pandemic chaos at the heart of No10 last year, alleging ""there wasn't even a plan to bury all the bodies"". He savaged Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who he claimed should have been sacked for lying to the PM that the elderly would be tested before they were released from hospitals into care homes in the early days of the virus. In a grovelling apology for his own failings, including the Barnard Castle affair, the ousted Downing Street adviser said Britain was ""let down"" as the country was blindsided by the virus and crippled by inaction. Mr Cummings spoke out to MPs during an astonishing seven-hour evidence session. Last night, both Mr Johnson and Mr Hancock rejected Mr Cummings' version of events as Westminster reeled from the unprecedented broadside. The PM said: ""I am absolutely confident that we took the decisions in the best interests of the British people."" A spokesman for Mr Hancock rejected claims made against the Health Secretary, saying that he and his department have ""worked incredibly hard in unprecedented circumstances to protect the NHS and save lives"". Mr Cummings was forced out late last year in a power struggle with Mr Johnson's fiancee Carrie Symonds. I am absolutely confident that we took the decisions in the best interests of the British people. Yesterday, he spoke of the PM's lockdown scepticism, planning chaos, internal fights and paralysis — claiming the country was let down as ""lions were led by donkeys again and again"". He told a Commons committee: ""When the public needed us most, the Government failed."" Mr Cummings claimed the PM was far too slow to lock down and that Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill was suggesting as late as March 13 last year Mr Johnson go on telly to urge the public to have ""chicken pox parties"" to spread Covid and build up immunity. By Harry Cole and Natasha Clark BRITAIN was failed by the choice between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn as PM in the last election, Dominic Cummings said yesterday. The ex-aide lashed his old boss, saying Mr Johnson is ""fundamentally unfit for the job"" and thousands of others could do better. He said that the PM ""changes his mind ten times a day"", was a ""thousand times too obsessed with the media"" and cared more about making headlines than making tough decisions. He also revealed Mr Johnson had wanted chief medical officer Chris Whitty to inject him with coronavirus on live TV to prove it was nothing to worry about — believing it was similar to swine flu. Mr Cummings also told yesterday's committee hearing: ""It's just completely crackers that someone like me should have been in there, just the same as it's crackers that Boris Johnson was in there, and that the choice at the last election was Jeremy Corbyn."" And he insisted the PM did say he'd rather see ""bodies pile high"" than order another lockdown. Mr Cummings said Mr Johnson dismissed Covid as a scare story and presided over a government of chaos — even revelling in it. He claimed he told his then-boss during a conversation about his departure: ""This whole system is chaos, this whole building is chaos but you are more frightened of me having the power to stop the chaos than the chaos itself. ""He laughed and said, 'You're right, I am more frightened of you having the power to stop the chaos, chaos isn't that bad, chaos means that everyone has to look to me to see who's in charge'."" Asked if he thought Mr Johnson was a ""fit and proper person to get us through the pandemic"", Mr Cummings replied bluntly: ""No."" He alleged Mr Johnson made the same mistake by not locking down early enough last autumn, resulting in thousands more needless deaths. And reigniting his war with Ms Symonds, Mr Cummings claimed the PM was distracted in early 2020 as the virus threat grew by his private life and it was ""crackers"" Mr Johnson was even running the country. In a blistering assault, he accused the PM of being on holiday and claimed ""lots of key people were literally skiing"" as Covid lapped at Britain's shores. Insisting he heard Mr Johnson's infamous ""let the bodies pile high"" comment, Mr Cummings rounded on ministers, advisers and the civil service as he gave a blow-by-blow account of last March's disaster — claiming there was ""overall total system failure"". Branding the Cabinet Office ""terrifyingly awful"", he revealed that a Civil Service boss had confessed at the height of panic: ""I've been told for years there is a plan — there is no plan; we are in huge trouble. I think we are absolutely f***ed."" He claimed Helen McNamara, the deputy Cabinet Secretary, came to the PM's study where Mr Cummings was looking at his lockdown plans in mid-March and warned: ""I think this country is heading for a disaster, we are going to kill thousands of people."" By Kate Ferguson MATT Hancock sent thousands of frail Brits to their deaths by allowing Covid to get into care homes — and then lied about it, Dominic Cummings claimed. He said the Health Secretary should have been fired 15 or 20 times over a string of failures. Mr Hancock was guilty of ""criminal, disgraceful behaviour"" for his errors over test and trace and PPE, the rogue ex-aide fumed. Grim official stats show 42,341 care-home residents in England and Wales died because of Covid. The former aide said Boris Johnson was on the brink of firing Mr Hancock in April last year — a claim Downing Street did not deny. But the PM did not go through with it as other aides advised him that Mr Hancock would be useful as a fall guy later on. Mr Cummings said: ""I said sack him almost every week, sometimes almost every day. He was told, though, you should keep him there, because he's the person you fire when the inquiry comes along."" He said the Health Secretary promised in the Cabinet room that all hospital patients discharged back into care homes would be tested — but they were not. Mr Cummings said he and the PM discovered the truth only in April last year. He added: ""Now all the Government rhetoric of 'we put a shield around care homes' and blah blah, was complete nonsense. ""Quite the opposite of putting a shield around them, we sent people with Covid back to care homes."" Last night Mr Hancock said he had not seen Mr Cummings' evidence, ""and instead I've been dealing with getting the vaccination rollout going, and saving lives"". But earlier, his spokesman had said: ""We absolutely reject Mr Cummings' claims."" And he revealed: ""The core of the Government collapsed when the Prime Minister got ill himself . . . people thought he might die."" Mr Johnson was in hospital for a week in April last year — including a spell in intensive care. Mr Cummings said the PM made ""some very bad misjudgments and got some very serious things wrong"". He explained that by the end of October last year, his relationship with Mr Johnson had deteriorated to the extent that ""fundamentally, I regarded him as unfit for the job and I was trying to create a structure around him to try and stop what I thought were extremely bad decisions"". He added: ""If you took anybody at random from the top one per cent competent people in this country and presented them with the situation, they would have behaved differently to how the Prime Minister behaved."" But the Brexit architect saved most of his vitriol for Mr Hancock. He said: ""I think the Secretary of State for Health should've been fired for at least 15, 20 things, including lying to everybody on multiple occasions in meeting after meeting in the Cabinet room and publicly. ""There's no doubt at all that many senior people performed far, far disastrously below the standards which the country has a right to expect. ""I think the Secretary of State for Health is certainly one of those people. ""I said repeatedly to the Prime Minister that he should be fired, so did the Cabinet Secretary, so did many other senior people."" Mr Cummings said the planned public inquiry into Covid, due to start in spring next year, was too late. He added: ""Tens of thousands of people died who didn't need to die. ""There is absolutely no excuse for delaying that because a lot of the reasons for why that happened are still in place now."" Tens of thousands of people died who didn't need to die. Midway through Mr Cummings' evidence session, Mr Johnson appeared in the Commons. He told MPs: ""I don't think anybody could credibly accuse this Government of being complacent about the threat this virus posed at any point."" The PM added: ""I take full responsibility for everything that has happened. ""I am truly sorry for the suffering the people of this country have experienced. ""But the Government acted throughout with the intention to save lives, protect the NHS and in accordance with the best scientific advice."" Mr Hancock — who went for a run before Mr Cummings gave evidence — is expected to face MPs today and will hit back at a press conference. Last night, a former No10 colleague of Mr Cummings called him a ""disingenuous little f***"". The source added: ""I have never seen such a squirming nest of vicious contradiction embodied in a single individual."""
220,220,The Sun,Jack ElsomNatasha ClarkHarry ColeKate Ferguson,Dominic Cummings says Covid plans ‘derailed’ by Carrie Symonds going ‘crackers’ over dog & Trump wanting to bomb Iraq,"A CRUCIAL Covid meeting was thrown into chaos by Boris Johnson's fiancee ""going crackers"" about her dog and Donald Trump wanting help bombing Iraq, Dominic Cummings sensationally claimed today. The PM's former adviser described how an ""insane situation"" in No10 on March 12 last year distracted officials from pressing pandemic decisions. During a dynamite appearance before MPs he revealed how Downing Street was in tailspin the day a critical decision about whether to impose household quarantine was being made. The ex-aide said the high-stakes talks were ""disrupted"" because the US President wanted the UK to join a bombing campaign in the Middle East. Mr Cummings recalled: ""Everything to do with Cobra that day on Covid was completely distracted because you had these two parallel sets of meetings. ""You had National Security people running in and out as we were trying to figure out if we were going to do household quarantine."" He then claimed further pandemonium erupted because Mr Johnson's fiancee Carrie Symonds was incensed about an article about her dog Dilyn. Ms Symonds publicly rubbished a report at the time that claimed the couple planned to rehome their rescue pooch, describing it as ""complete c**p"". Laying bare a fiasco ""so surreal it couldn't possibly be true"", Mr Cummings said No10 resources were diverted to rebut these media reports. He said: ""The PM's girlfriend was going completely crackers about this story and demanding the press office deal with that. ""So we had this completely insane situation in which part of the building was saying we had to bomb Iraq, part of the building deciding whether to do quarantine, and the PM has his girlfriend going crackers about something completely trivial."" The swipe at Ms Symonds is the latest salvo in their bitter feud that saw Mr Cummings leave No10 last December following a power struggle. And at today's marathon session he claimed the PM's fiancee was ""desperate to get rid of me and my team"". He accused of her trying to install her friends into senior Government positions ""in a way which was not only completely unethical but was clearly illegal"". Mr Cummings said the attorney general eventually persuaded the PM not to join the US bombing campaign. Washington carried out airstrikes that night in retaliation to a rocket attack that killed two US troops and a British soldier. The top aide said in an explosive evidence session today: In bombshell evidence to the joint health and science committee, the PM's former top aide accused Boris of dismissing Covid as a ""scare story"" and ""just swine flu"" and admitted he and the PM had ""failed"" Britain by not locking down weeks before. He said he should have been ""hitting the panic button"" far earlier than he was, and the nation should have locked down in the first week of March at the very earliest. In a scathing assessment to MPs today, he claimed Helen McNamara, the deputy cabinet secretary, came to PM's study where Mr Cummings was looking at his lockdown plans. She reportedly told him: ""I've been told for years there is a plan; there is no plan; we are in huge trouble. ""I think we are absolutely f**ked. I think this country is heading for a disaster, we are going to kill thousands of people."" Mr Cummings claimed the PM was far too slow to lock down and Mark Sedwill, the Cabinet Secretary, was suggesting Boris go on telly as late as March 13 to urge the public to have 'chicken pox parties' to spread Covid and build up immunity. The top aide, who left Government last year in a flurry of fury and briefings, said March last year was like an ""out of control movie"". He said: ""Imagine this is like a scene from Independence Day... your whole plan is broken and you need a new plan - that is what the scene was like."" No10 was not on a war footing fast enough and ""lots of key people were skiing in the middle of February"", he raged. Ministers didn't realise the huge holes in their planning until it was too late, he claimed, and called the Cabinet office ""terrifyingly s**t"". And Matt Hancock should have been fired ""about 20 times"" for ""lying to everybody on multiple occasions"" - and he told the PM to get rid of him. There was no plan for furlough or for shielding until the very last minute, he said, but dodged questions on whether ministers should face corporate manslaughter charges."
221,221,The Sun,Natasha ClarkHarry Cole,Boris Johnson warned plans to punish homeowners who fail to buy costly green boilers could spark riots,"BORIS Johnson has been warned that potty plans to punish homeowners who fail to buy costly green boilers could spark riots. No 10 yesterday scrambled to defuse fears of huge fines for those not switching to eco alternatives such as heat pumps. But it refused to rule out possible stealth taxes and gas price rises. Some Tory MPs say the Government is being dishonest about the reality of its aim to make the UK carbon neutral by 2050. Proposals would see gas boilers banned in new-builds by 2025 and stripped out of other homes by 2035. Alternatives cost upwards of £10,000 to install and hundreds a year to maintain. Critics say they do not work as well as gas heating. But ministers are also looking at switching subsidies on gas to electric to make it costlier to keep gas boilers. In today's Sun, former Tory minister Steve Baker writes: ""The elite policymakers who govern our lives agree we should reduce our carbon emissions but they have not been up front about the cost for working families."" He hints current proposals could spark unrest not seen since the 1990s, saying: ""The cost of Net Zero could deliver a political crisis greater than the Poll Tax."" The PM's spokesman said there were no plans to fine people for using fossil fuel appliances they have installed or for refusing to switch. Asked to explicitly rule out ""any financial penalties"" the spokesman was more vague. He said: ""We want to ensure there are incentives for the public to transition to low carbon alternatives by making these choices affordable and efficient and easy."""
222,222,The Sun,Jack ElsomNatasha ClarkHarry Cole,"Weddings, social distancing and masks update delayed as PM wants more time to review Indian variant data","BORIS Johnson has kicked the final decision on lifting masks and social distancing into next week in a bid to lift many restrictions as possible in June. The Prime Minister had hoped to make an announcement on post-Freedom Day measures ""by the end of the month"", but this has been pushed back into next week while ministers look carefully at the data on the Indian variant. The Prime Minister wants the most amount of data possible before making a final call of where masks will needed and if the hated 1.5m rule can finally go. The Sun revealed two weeks ago that Mr Johnson wanted to take a ""maximalist"" approach to ending the restrictions, despite a wobble over the Indian variant. No10 signalled Brits would have to wait at least another week while officials pore over the latest data, before deciding on whether to go ahead on the June 21 relation. The PM's official spokesperson said: ""I think it's reasonable for a new variant such as this and the need to gather as much data as possible to inform our decisions. ""It's right to take the time to get that information before making those final decisions."" Mr Johnson remains optimistic about being able to end all legal restrictions as per his roadmap on June 21. A decision on whether or not to press ahead with tearing up lockdown rules  once and for all on June 21 will be taken a week earlier on June 14. But it's not yet clear whether some measures may have to stay in place to tackle the faster-spreading India variant. Ministers have been growing worried about the new strain, but latest data shows the vaccine does still work against it. However, insiders said he just wanted to be 100 per cent sure before making any final calls. A Whitehall sources told The Sun: ""Don't automatically think a delay means bad news - the PM wants to lift as many restrictions as possible but wants to be armed with the data to win over naysayers."" Hopes Brits will get the green light to ditch masks in shops, bars and offices soared last night after a top vaccine boss said the country may be just weeks away from declaring ""the pandemic is over"". Professor Andrew Pollard of the Oxford Vaccine Group said: If the current generation of vaccines are able to stop people going to hospital then the pandemic is over, because we can live with the virus."" Meanwhile, pub bosses warned that all restrictions must be torn up on June 21 for local boozers to survive. Emma McClarkin, chief exec of the British Beer and Pub Association, said bars are struggling to break even with the current dictates in place. She told MPs: ""Our businesses will not start their journeys to recovery until all restrictions are removed – June 21 has to be the date that all restrictions fall away. ""Any lingering restrictions would put in jeopardy our pubs and brewers."" She also slammed proposals for vaccine passports to vet who can go to the pub. These 'papers for pints' would hit revenues by a whopping 25 per cent and suck all the spontaneity out of going to the pub, she said. She told MPs pubs are ""implacably against"" the plan. Punters must know the ""pub is there"" for them as life gets back to ""normal"", she said. Mr Johnson had also hoped to make an announcement on weddings to give Brits at least one month for their banns - but now looks set to delay this. He said last Friday: ""We will let people know as much as we possibly can by the end of the month about weddings, for instance. ""All the details we'll try and let people know by the end of the month about exactly where we think we'll be on June 21, Step 4."" At the moment weddings are capped at 30 - including the bride and groom. But campaigners hope this will finally be ditched next month, allowing unlimited numbers. It comes as The Sun revealed how Boris and Carrie are set to celebrate their own wedding next July. The Prime Minister, 56, and his fiancée, 33, have sent save-the-date cards to family and friends for a lavish bash on Saturday, July 30, 2022. The couple got engaged in late 2019 but, like thousands of other loved-up Brits, have had to delay plans because of Covid. Publication of a separate review into Covid certificates - including where they will be used if at all - has also been pushed back. The PM has ruled out introducing vaccine passports for the pub, but a wider review into Covid certificates is underway. It's likely they will be put in place for large scale events like football matches and gigs. The PM's spokesman said earlier: ""We will do it as soon as possible based on the latest data, which will help inform us what measures we can take around certification."""
223,223,The Sun,Ben HillHarry Cole,Britain smashes 60 MILLION jabs milestone as top medic says we’re ‘looking good’ for June 21 unlocking,"BRITAIN has smashed its 60 million jabs milestone, as a top medic says the UK is ""looking good"" for lockdown ending on June 21. There were 762,361 first and second doses of the vaccine given out across the UK yesterday, the most since the rollout began. The total number of people having their first dose of the Covid vaccine is now 37,943,681 after 205,410 got their initial jabs yesterday. Meanwhile 556,951 got their second shots on Saturday, meaning 22,643,417 Brits are now fully vaccinated. This morning Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, confirmed it's ""looking good if people are continuing to observe all of the safety signals"" for the final stage of the roadmap. And Dr Harries was backed by Home Secretary Priti Patel who said: ""The data is positive in terms of where we are - look at the vaccine information that has been published today about the level of protection against specific variants."" But the Home Secretary warned some mask-wearing would continue. They are likely to be binned in shops, pubs and workplaces — but will continue on trains and buses. Ministers hope to unveil within days an end to 1.5 metre social- distancing rules from next month. Ms Patel cautioned that there would not be a ""green light all the way"" to unlocking restrictions. She said: ""We all have to be conscientious. All of us that are out and about now, we are distancing, wearing masks, following all the rules."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock described yesterday as a ""huge day"" for the vaccine effort as the total number of jabs given out hit 60,587,098. He tweeted: ""This is a fantastic milestone in our fight against this virus. ""Thank you to everyone involved in our national effort. When you get the call, get the jab."" He also said in a statement: ""Our trailblazing vaccination programme - the biggest and most successful in NHS history - is another great British success story and a testament to what can be achieved when all four corners of country comes together to defeat this virus. ""Our country has one of the highest uptake rates in the world and I'm delighted that so many have answered our call to arms. If you have not yet come forward, and you are eligible, I urge you to take up the offer - it could save your life and protect your loved ones."" Nadhim Zahawi, Minister for Covid Vaccine Deployment, tweeted: ""The five dozen done! ""Over 60,000,000 doses administered in the United Kingdom! Together we will defeat this virus."" The figures mean that one in three adults in England are now fully vaccinated against Covid. The success of the vaccine rollout and tests proving the jab does work against the Indian variant means the June 21 lockdown lift is ""back on"". After weeks of worry, ""Freedom Day"" is set to go ahead as findings showed Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines both give a high level of protection after two doses. Pfizer was 88 per cent effective after two jabs while AstraZeneca proved 60 per cent effective. Both vaccines were 33 per cent effective against symptomatic disease from the Indian variant three weeks after the first dose, compared with about 50 per cent against the Kent strain. Professor Susan Hopkins, PHE's Covid-19 strategic response director, said the data trend was ""quite clear"" and heading in the ""right direction"". Telly personality Piers Morgan was one of those to have a second jab yesterday. He gave the thumbs-up and thanked volunteer staff after being vaccinated in Chelsea,  West London. However, the good rollout news was overshadowed as ministers and medics traded public blows once again with former No10 guru Dominic Cummings. Westminster awaits with bated breath a bombshell evidence session on Wednesday where the rogue aide will be grilled by MPs. Ahead of the showdown, Dr Harries hit out at Mr Cummings' broadsides against the Government's Covid handling. After his claims that medics pursued a strategy to let the virus rip through the population in the early days, she told the Andrew Marr Show: ""I can categorically say I have never been in any Government meeting where herd immunity was put forward at that point of the pandemic as a mechanism of control."" And she warned the claim has ""been misinterpreted in many places"" and discussions about so-called herd immunity were ""rather simplistic"". In a series of explosive tweets, the Prime Minister's former top adviser  said the policy — to build up resistance in the population by allowing some spread of the disease — was dropped in March last year only after a warning it would lead to a ""catastrophe"". In a dig at the PM, he said there may have been no need for lockdowns if the country had the ""right preparations and competent people in charge"". When Ms Patel was asked by Andrew Marr about the claim that herd immunity had been the original policy, she replied: ""Absolutely not."" But Mr Cummings hit back, dismissing Government denials at the time as ""bulls***"" and saying No10 had chosen to lie — a move he described as ""very foolish"" and demonstrating ""appalling ethics"". He also hinted he might have documentary evidence to back his claims,  which he could produce when he appears before the Commons' health and science committees on Wednesday. "" 'Herd immunity by September' was literally the official plan in all documents/graphs/meetings until it was ditched,"" he tweeted. ""In week of March 9, No10 was made aware by various people that the official plan would lead to catastrophe. ""It was then replaced by Plan B. But how 'herd immunity by September' could have been the plan until that week is a fundamental issue in the whole disaster."" Some 2,235 people have tested positive for the bug in the past 24 hours, with five deaths recorded over the same timeframe."
224,224,The Sun,Harry ColeAlice Grahns,Homeowners face gas boiler ban within 14 years and it could cost thousands to replace them,"HOMEOWNERS face a gas boiler ban within 14 years and it could cost thousands to replace them. Households may also be hit with ""financial penalties"" if they don't replace their old gas boilers with the expensive green alternatives. Almost a third of the UK's carbon emissions come from heating systems, with ministers warned this must be rapidly cut to hit their vow to make the country carbon neutral by 2050. The government is said to be discussing a cut-off date of 2035, when the use of gas boilers in existing homes would be phased out. It comes after reports that gas boilers will be banned in all new-build homes from 2023 - two years earlier than planned. The Business department wants to make it mandatory for anyone replacing a conventional gas boiler or doing significant renovations to go green. THERE are a number of different ways to ""decarbonise One option is scrapping gas boilers and instead using a heat network that pumps hot water and air through pipes to warm homes. Another idea is to just use electricity to warm homes. Some households are already electricity-only, using storage heaters instead of radiators to heat their property. Ofgem has said it could also look at different ways to making homes electric, such as by using electricity to power heat pumps. Lastly, gas boilers could be upgraded to work with decarbonised gas, such as hydrogen. Energy experts have told The Sun that low-carbon heat pumps and heat networks could add £5,000 to the cost of a new build. But replacements such as eco-friendly heat pumps are typically at least £10,000. Officials are reportedly plotting a costly assault on the wallets of those who do not comply with planned eco rules, says Bloomberg news wire. Enforcement options ""could include the threat of financial penalties for non-compliance"". But sources insisted these would be not be direct fines, hinting instead at financial incentives to switch away from gas. These will be at the centre of Net Zero plans to be unveiled in the coming months — despite PM Boris Johnson promising Sun readers they would not be out of pocket. MP Steve Baker has warned that the move could spark consumer anger. He told the Daily Mail: ""The policy elite have persuaded themselves there is a consensus for net zero without anyone bothering to explain the implications to the public. 'When people do work out the cost and impact on their lives there is going to be a huge backlash. ""If we go down the road of forcing people to replace their boiler at a cost of thousands of pounds it will make the cladding scandal look like a walk in the park."" Octopus Energy says 17million UK homes still use gas boilers. It said: ""With over 1.5 million people replacing their boilers every year, there are huge gains to be made, but we need affordable alternatives."" Earlier this week, Climate Change Minister Lord Callanan unveiled new powers to clamp down on landlords who do not properly insulate their properties. Last week, the Internal Energy Agency (IEA) said gas boilers should be banned from 2025 to help fight climate change. While in February last year, Ofgem announced plans that mean gas boilers would have to be ditched from homes or upgraded by 2050. Meanwhile, boiler breakdowns affect 200,000 homes each winter."
225,225,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds ‘will celebrate their wedding’ next summer,"BORIS Johnson and Carrie Symonds will ""celebrate their wedding"" next summer, The Sun can reveal. The Prime Minister, 56, and his fiancée, 33, have sent save-the-date cards to family and friends for a lavish bash on Saturday, July 30, 2022. The couple got engaged in late 2019 but, like thousands of other loved-up Brits, have had to delay plans because of Covid. Details of exactly where the couple will say ""I do"" remain a closely guarded secret, but pals say they are waiting until next year for a big celebration to be on the safe side. BoJo is expected to announce that the lockdown cap of 30 guests at weddings will be lifted next month. However, friends of the couple say the fight against the virus, and getting the country bouncing back from the pandemic, means this summer is too soon for their big knees-up. Early contenders as a location for the party include the PM's country pile Chequers in Buckinghamshire, or the Port Lympne safari park in Kent, where Carrie works. Last night a spokesman for the couple declined to comment on a ""private family event"". The only other PM to marry in office was Lord Liverpool who wed Mary Chester in 1822. Boris and Carrie were first seen together at a 2018 fundraiser. They have already become the first unmarried couple to live in Downing Street, moving there in July 2019. He reportedly proposed on holiday on the Caribbean island of Mustique, shortly after his landslide victory at December 2019's General Election. Commons sleazebusters are currently probing who exactly paid for the five-star trip amid a donations row. The engagement — and news that Carrie was expecting their first child — was announced publicly in late February 2020. The pandemic hit weeks later and the PM faced an intensive-care battle with Covid that April. Son Wilfred was born on April 29, 2020, and given the middle name Nicholas after two doctors who saved the PM's life. Mr Johnson has since remained tight-lipped about his wedding plans. Asked this March if he would be tying the knot when lockdown restrictions lift fully, the PM would only say to The Sun: ""The wedding industry is certainly going to come roaring back in common with many other sectors of the economy."" News of the pending nuptials will spark plenty of speculation about where the biggest political wedding in decades will be held. Wilfred was christened at Westminster Cathedral in central London in September. Boris also has access to Chequers, used by Prime Ministers as a retreat since the 1920s, and 40 miles from No10. He quit as Foreign Secretary in July 2018, days after a meeting at the estate in which then-PM Theresa May urged her warring Cabinet to hammer out a Brexit plan. Boris also used Chequers' 1,500 acres to convalesce following his virus battle. A source told The Sun tonight: ""It would be nice for Chequers to be in the news for happy reasons for once."" Looking to read more on the Prime Minister's life? We have you covered... The Port Lympne Reserve and hotel in Kent is also thought to be in the running for next summer's bash. Carrie works for conservation charity the Aspinall Foundation that runs the zoo, home to giraffes, zebras, rhinos and gorillas. The vast reserve also hosts quirky weddings as well as safari tours. Mr Johnson's own country house in his former constituency of Henley, Oxfordshire, could easily have played host to the bash — but it was recently rented out. Commons registers show the farmhouse near Thame is bringing in at least £10,000 a year in rental income. One estate agent's advert offers it for £4,250 a month. The PM also shares a farm and land in Devon with his siblings but it is not thought to be under consideration for the wedding. It had previously been reported that the pair could marry in Italy, where Carrie has relatives. But pals said that would be impractical with travel restrictions for a large party. Another option for the couple could be No10 Downing Street itself. It has plenty of vast state rooms and a large garden that could easily fit hundreds of guests. THE wedding will be the third for Boris — and Carrie's first. He tied the knot with first wife Allegra Mostyn-Owen in 1987. That marriage was annulled in 1993 — the same year he married Marina Wheeler. The couple had four children but separated in 2018. They formally divorced weeks before news emerged of Boris's engagement to Carrie. The only other PM to marry in office was Lord Liverpool who wed Mary Chester in 1822. His first wife Louisa, 54, died the previous year. Boris is also thought to be the first PM to divorce in office since Augustus FitzRoy, the 3rd Duke of Grafton. An act of Parliament allowed him to leave first wife Anne in 1769. He went on to marry Elizabeth Wrottesley and they had 13 children. The couple's flat has been recently renovated, triggering a number of investigations into who paid for the work. Mr Johnson says he met the costs himself, but declined to say who stumped up the original bill, reported to be £38,000. The Electoral Commission opened a probe after leaked emails appeared to show a Tory donor had initially stumped up the cash. The Prime Minister's own standards adviser is also poised to report on the matter before the Commons breaks up for the summer. HEARTY congratulations to Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds, who are set to hold their wedding celebrations next summer. It means Boris will become the first serving PM in 200 years to marry, in what will no doubt be a bumper year for weddings across the country. Just a quick reminder to guests: on this one occasion, we'd advise steering clear of John Lewis for the wedding gifts."
226,226,The Sun,Harry ColeJoe Duggan,Boris Johnson ‘can’t imagine how William and Harry feel’ and says BBC MUST make sure Diana failures ‘never happen again’,"BORIS Johnson has told the BBC that it must take ""every possible step"" to prevent another Martin Bashir-type scandal. And ministers are renewing their calls for massive reforms of how the Corporation is run amid a raging war between the Royal Family and the broadcasting giant. Lord Dyson's withering review exposed how journalist Bashir used faked documents to obtain his 1995 interview with Princess Diana for Panorama and the subsequent BBC cover-up of his ""deceitful tactics"". The Prime Minister stressed that he was ""obviously concerned"" by the findings. Mr Johnson added: ""I can only imagine the feelings of the Royal Family and I hope very much that the BBC will be taking every possible step to make sure nothing like this ever happens again."" The slapdown came as ministers warned they are ""looking very carefully"" at ripping up the Beeb's entire governance structure, given the major internal failing exposed by the ""damning"" probe. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said: ""They have apologised, which is appropriate, but clearly the wider issues of governance and the way things are run now need to be looked at."" The Corporation sent personal apologies to the Prince of Wales, the Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex and Princess Diana's brother Earl Spencer. But several Government figures have claimed the apology did not go far enough. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said he is now looking at whether further changes are needed. He added: ""I welcome the fact that the new [BBC] leadership launched this independent inquiry and expect them to ensure that this can never happen again."" The BBC has a royal charter that enshrines its public purpose and mission — as well as its funding, governance and regulatory arrangements. The current deal started on January 1, 2017, and ends on December 31, 2027. A mid-term review, due next year, will look at oversight and accountability but not the broadcaster's funding. Yesterday, the Beeb was warned publicly that in light of Lord Dyson's findings, this review now takes on a fresh significance. Mr Buckland added: ""The Government has to, in the light of these serious findings, consider the matter very carefully and comprehensively indeed. ""It was not just the decision of a reporter or a production team, there were decisions made much further up the chain about the conduct of these individuals that have now proved, according to Lord Dyson, to be unfounded and wrong. ""The Government does have a responsibility to look very carefully to see whether the governance of the BBC does need reform in the light of these devastating findings."" On the BBC's Today programme yesterday, Mr Buckland was told the BBC had ""many political enemies"" and was asked if Mr Johnson would use the Panorama incident as an ""excuse to tackle the BBC"". He replied: ""I don't think anybody should be using this serious set of revelations as an excuse to do or not do anything. The facts, sadly, speak very much for themselves. ""We've heard the reaction of the family and I think it's incumbent upon everybody to soberly and calmly go through what has happened and to make appropriate changes to ensure this can never and should never happen again."" Last night, senior Tories also put pressure on former BBC director-general Lord Hall, who led the botched internal review in the late 1990s into Bashir's interview. Former Conservative Party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said the peer should quit his plum job as boss of the National Gallery because of his ""woefully ineffective role in the Diana affair"". And further hints at a clampdown on how the BBC is run came from Home Secretary Priti Patel. She said: ""There will be very searching questions for the BBC. With a free Press and free media, the media themselves and broadcasters, and the national broadcaster, have a huge sense of responsibility with the way they investigate, review and conduct reports."" Tory Julian Knight, boss of the Commons' powerful media committee, said MPs would be discussing the BBC fallout next week. He added: ""There are serious questions still left to answer — namely, why was Martin Bashir rehired with the BBC knowing what they knew? I am writing to the BBC's Director-General Tim Davie for urgent answers. ""I want to know how the BBC can reassure the committee that there could be no repeat of the serious failings that have been highlighted by the Dyson report. ""Now more than ever, the BBC must show transparency and honesty in its response."""
227,227,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Burger and wine bonanza as Boris Johnson signs off groundbreaking tax-free Australian trade deal… in 15 years’ time,"BORIS Johnson will offer Australia a 15-year transition to an historic zero-tariff, zero-quota trade deal, The Sun can reveal. Trade Secretary Liz Truss has the Cabinet's blessing to ink such a post-Brexit accord with our longstanding ally despite fierce resistance from Britain's farmers. Agriculture has been running sore in the trade negotiations - with the Aussie's pushing for a rapid five year slashing of all import and export taxes on goods. But amid fears our farmers could be undercut by an influx of cheaper Aussie beef and lamb, the decade and half bulwark was agreed by the inner-Cabinet committee in charge of talks. The offer will now be made to the Australian side - with ministerial sources confident an agreement is now in sight despite further haggling to be done on the exact length of the transition. Advocates for the deal say food and wine will get cheaper in British supermarkets when import levies are abolished. But the tariffs on imports and exports on all goods would be ""tapered out slowly"" to allow Brit farmers to adjust after a major row over the deal had erupted. Dubbed the ""battle for the soul of Brexit"" the PM threw his weight behind Cabinet free traders led by Ms Truss in a blow to protectionists Michael Gove and George Eustice who wanted to limit the terms of the deal. Environment Secretary Mr Eustice had been pushing for quotas on meat imports from down under to be included in the deal, but a government source said he was ""left isolated"" with his plea. Brexiteers had argued keeping tariffs and quotas would undermine the point of breaking away from Brussels to strike out with new deals, and Australia should be able to trade on the same terms we trade with the EU. Mr Johnson's trade strategy committee - that included the Foreign and Business Secretaries as well as the Chancellor - are understood to have agreed to include other protections to maintain high standards of farming, but concluded to the ""grand principle"" that the tariff barriers should be dropped. Australia and the UK could now sign the new treaty when their PM Scott Morrison jets to Cornwall next month for the G7 summit. Declining to comment on the details of the meeting, last night No10 said the PM ""wants to maximise the massive opportunities presented by post-Brexit trade deals."" The PM's spokesman insisted that any agreement would include protections for our agriculture industry and won't undercut UK farmers, adding: ""We want a deal that is good for the British public and any agreement would have protection for the agriculture industry."""
228,228,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Tory rift over Brexit trade deal for cheap Aussie burgers and steak in British supermarkets,"BRITAIN and Australia are haggling over a decade long phasing out of all taxes on meat imports amid a major rift in the Cabinet. The two governments are on the cusp of a post-Brexit trade deal but a Whitehall war of words has erupted over claims ""Waitrose Tories"" want to block cheaper food on store shelves. Ministers are under massive pressure from farmers and rich landowners to water down the deal over fears it would be too much competition for Britain's struggling agriculture sector and see a decline in standards. But a row has exploded in Cabinet with supporters of the deal arguing it will slash the price of high quality steaks and burgers in British supermarkets. Oz trade negotiators are pushing for a rapid five year slashing of all import taxes on their beef and lamb heading to our stores. But amid a major backlash from farming unions, Environment Secretary George Eustice backed by ally Michael Gove say it must be at least 15 years and some restrictions could remain even then. But a faction led by Trade Secretary Liz Truss, backed by Brexit guru David Frost and Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, are seeking the blessing tomorrow from Boris Johnson to settle on about 10 years. Allies of the free trade backers were confident they had Mr Johnson onside, but one cautioned BoJo could often change his mind during big set piece showdowns. Ahead of the crunch meeting of the PM's inner-Cabinet committee in charge of trade deals on Thursday, tension bubbled over last night. Supporters of Ms Truss accused Mr Gove and Mr Eustice of being ""more Waitrose than Red Wall"" - claiming their go slow approach will keep prices high for consumers. One Whitehall source said: ""I really don't know why George Eustice even voted for Brexit if he does not want to take advantage of actually leaving the EU."" And last night Mr Kwarteng went public with his concerns, telling the BBC: ""If we can't do a trade deal with Australia, two countries with a shared culture, I think any other deals are looking very challenging."" The business secretary added that he was confident it would be ""a good deal"" and it would be bolstered by a transition of around a decade to give British farmers ""plenty of time to adjust."" But the National Farmers Union said ministers must avoid signing the deal in its current terms and ditch their target of inking it at next month's G7 summit. NFU president Minette Batters said ""If we are taking back control we are taking back control regardless of time limits. Let us take as long as it takes."" ""The British Government faces a choice. It must recognise that opening up zero-tariff trade on all imports of products such as beef and lamb means British farming, working to its current high standards, will struggle to compete."" BREXIT will be a roaring success — only if we grasp its golden new opportunities. So it would be insane not to sign the free trade deal with Australia negotiated by Liz Truss. It is the first that isn't just a tweaked and improved version of what we had under the EU. But it is fiercely resisted by those, some in the Cabinet, who claim imports will harm our farmers. Rubbish. Not only will they have a decade before it is fully implemented — but can they really not compete with Aussie rivals who operate to similarly exacting standards and have to ship their meat 10,000 miles? We must sign this deal and one with New Zealand too. Both will mean cheaper grub for millions. Leaving the EU was about taking back control of our laws, money and borders while opening Britain up to the world for trade. The ""full fat"" Brexit we did handed us total freedom to do so. What a catastrophic signal it will send if ""global Britain"" rejects its first brand-new trade deal and pulls up the drawbridge."
229,229,The Sun,Daniel JonesHarry ColeBen Hill,Boozy Brits let their hair down as indoor boozing finally returns – and there’ll be some sore heads today,"BOOZY Brits have let their hair down as they hit the town last night with indoor drinking finally returning. Some thirsty drinkers will be waking up with sore heads after Brits blew £2.8 million a minute enjoying The Great Indoors in fully open pubs and restaurants. Excited punters were seen out and about on the streets of England after making the most of their newfound freedoms. Two gal pals gave each other a smooch in Liverpool while enjoying their night out. Elsewhere in the city, a pair of friends were seen taking a tumble to the footpath as they shared a hug. There were wild scenes in Leeds as well as revellers celebrated a long-awaited return to being allowed inside pubs. Twenty million went drinking and eating inside, shopped and hit cinemas, theatres and gym classes for the first time in up to seven months yesterday. Around 140,000 boozers, restaurants and cafes were the busiest for nine months, since August's Eat Out to Help Out frenzy. A dash of drinkers and diners was seen across the country, in cities including London, Birmingham, Manchester and Newcastle. Cinemas saw a rush after Vue's 88 sites and most of Odeon's 112 locations reopened after some had been closed since October. Movie Peter Rabbit 2 drew fans. West End theatres saw a wave of socially-distanced customers. Gym indoor classes resumed as pals danced together. Shops saw a spending boost as friends went on joint high street trips and went for a pint or meal afterwards. Pub bosses even had to reassure boozy Brits they would not run out of beer. Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association, said: ""The enthusiasm for the return to pubs means demand is higher. ""But there is still plenty of beer to go round for everyone. ""Visit your local and enjoy a fresh pint."" Yesterday saw 2.5million pub drinkers knock back nine million pints, as 11.5million ate at restaurants and cafes, munching six million sandwiches and enjoying five million coffees. One of the pubs closed the longest in Britain finally reopened its doors after seven months — after ordering 2,200 pints to make sure it was not drunk dry by thirsty locals. Dennis Holmes, 67, who has run the Finishers Arms, Bolton, for 19 years with wife Christine, 68, said: ""We were shut by Tier 3 on October 23, and as we don't have an outdoor area, have now finally reopened. ""We almost retired just before Covid – but are now £17,000 in debt. ""We made a big beer order to ensure we didn't get caught out. Everyone's excited — but a bit worried about the Indian variant, which is high in Bolton."" Around £2billion was spent across pubs, eateries, shops and attractions yesterday, working out at £2.8million-a-minute at peak times, a VoucherCodes. co. uk study with the Centre for Retail Research showed. Professor Joshua Bamfield, director of the Centre for Retail Research, said: ""Pubs and restaurants stocked up and made sure they had enough beer and food. ""People were ready to make the most of the moment. ""Research showed the public's excitement about pubs and restaurants reopening indoors was significantly higher than for shops reopening."" But employers were hit by a £250million sickies bill from staff bunking off to booze yesterday — and feared productivity would dip today with workers struggling with headaches. Alan Price of BrightHR, which works with 10,000 workplaces, said: ""Employers should expect increased levels of unplanned absences as pubs reopen."" Just one sick day can cost a firm £375  because of the cost of covering the worker's role for a day, a study from accountants PwC has showed."
230,230,The Sun,Harry ColeNick Gutteridge,Britain and EU have six weeks to fix Northern Ireland border chaos or risk the province plunging into warfare,"BRITAIN and the EU have six weeks to fix the Northern Ireland border chaos or risk the province plunging into warfare. Chief Brexit minister David Frost has warned colleagues that July's sectarian marching season is key to finding a solution. Northern Ireland stayed in the Single Market after Brexit to avoid the need for a hard border with the South. But the EU's insistence on the toughest customs checks is hammering businesses on both sides of the Irish Sea. A source said: ""The EU approach is having a huge impact on lives and, worse still, there are signs it is upsetting the delicate peace process."" Lord Frost has told his EU counterpart Maros Sefcovic that the bloc has a responsibility to show flexibility and care."
231,231,The Sun,Harry Cole,Strip clubs WILL require punters to show Covid passports when they reopen,"VACCINE passports will be required to enter strip clubs when they reopen, The Sun can reveal. ""Adult entertainment venues"" have been added to stadiums and places with large crowds like nightclubs that will require punters to show proof a jab, negative test or antibodies before entering. Ministers are close to concluding their review into the controversial domestic vaccine certification, with Boris Johnson and lead minister Michael Gove both understood to have moved away from their wider use for pubs and restaurants. Strip clubs are due to open in June according to the PM's lockdown lifting roadmap, but will be slapped with the extra restrictions as they turn on their red lights for the first time since March 2020. The review in Covid papers is due to be published in as little as two weeks time. While ministers are enthusiastically pushing their use - via an updated NHS app - to help sunseeking Brits get abroad this summer, there has been a major backlash to widespread use domestically. The review led by Mr Gove has already made clear that vaccine proof will never been needed for essential shops, medical facilities or places of worship. However there has been a bitter debate in Whitehall at how far they could be used in pubs, bars, clubs and seedier venues. A government source told The Sun: ""The tide has gone out on pubs and restaurants but the reasons for proving you are protected against the virus in venues with much closer contact should be obvious."" Last night Downing Street sources insisted no final decisions on the review had been made and an update would be given by the end of the month."
232,232,The Sun,Harry Cole,Lockdown rules: Face masks to be ditched in shops and offices & social distancing scrapped on 21 June in current plans,"MASKS in shops and offices are heading for the chop on June 21. Social distancing will end in another huge lift for fed-up Brits. Boffins are on board with the plans by the National Economy Recovery Taskforce. Boris Johnson also aims to scrap the work-from-home order. An insider said: ""The current thinking points to social distancing going and mask wearing only in limited settings like buses, trains and the Tube. ""Obviously this is all dependent on final sign-off but the data is looking good and the political will is there for a proper lift-off."" The Sun has learned that the National Economy Recovery Taskforce have discussed a ""maximalist"" approach to lifting ""non-pharmaceutical interventions"" like masks and staying apart everywhere except for a small list of confined places. More unlocking measures, such as meeting indoors, are due on Monday, but social distancing and mask wearing have been kept under separate review. Government scientists are now said to be on board with the taskforce's plans as virus rates plummet while jabs soar. Masks on trains and buses remain an option but possibly without the fines to enforce the measure. Yesterday Boris signalled a return to offices was likely next month. He told the Commons that towns and cities ""depend on people having the confidence on going to work"". He added: ""That is certainly our intention, provided we stay on track. ""I want to be sure we are able to say that with more clarity, a bit later on. We must be guided by what is happening with the pandemic."" Any plans will only get the nod as long as a variant like the one from India does not rip through Britain. Sources say scientific advisers have told the PM that the bug will naturally retreat in the summer, and by winter Britain should be at peak immunity due to the vaccine rollout. Every Brit will be offered a first jab by the end of July, and by the autumn everyone will be double dosed. Some of the most vulnerable could be onto their third. From this morning, the NHS is inviting people aged 38 to 39 to book their jabs."
233,233,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha ClarkJonathan Reilly,Queen’s Speech unveils plans to unshackle Brexit Britain and bounce back from Covid,"THE Queen's Speech yesterday unveiled dynamic plans to unshackle Brexit Britain from Brussels red tape and the introduction of ""levelling-up"" laws. In Her Majesty's first major public appearance since the loss of Prince Philip, she revealed Boris Johnson's plan to help the whole country bounce back from Covid. The widowed monarch opened the new session of Parliament for the 65th time, with 25 new laws planned for the next year. And her Prime Minister warned things can never be the same again after Covid ravaged the country and economy. Mr Johnson vowed to ""harness the ingenuity and resolve"" of Britain's barnstorming vaccine rollout to heal other ills in society such as the housing crisis, regional inequality and educational unfairness. He said the virus had exposed ""deep wells of talent, kindness, ingenuity and resourcefulness"" in every village, town and city. Boris also put the nation on a diet with new anti-obesity measures. And he vowed: ""As the UK gets back on its feet, we will turbocharge our economic recovery in every part of the country, increasing and spreading opportunity."" THE Queen cut a sombre figure at her 67th State Opening of Parliament — her first since the death of Prince Philip. The event, stripped of its traditional pomp and circumstance, had just a handful of masked officials. Her Majesty wore a dusty lilac dress, instead of the usual regal robes. She travelled by car from Buckingham Palace and came into the House of Lords hand in hand with Prince Charles. The heavy Imperial State Crown, which she has not worn since 2016, was placed on a cushion nearby. Superfast 5G mobile broadband will be made available to the majority of the country by 2027 and the rollout of ""lightning"" speed broadband will be accelerated. The PM said being outside the ""burdensome"" EU meant public cash could be spent in a way that ""reflects our strategic interests and particular national circumstances"". And free from ""inflexible"" Brussels laws, reforms will be easier and quicker when directed from Westminster, with procurement able to focus on British firms. The policy blitz included a slew of new laws that will: However, nannying attempts to slim the nation's waistlines sparked a furious backlash last night, with struggling firms warning a junk food advert ban will hamper the recovery. And Mr Johnson was slammed after long-awaited reforms on how to pay for social care plans were still missing from the Queen's Speech. Instead, there was a vague promise to introduce them by the end of the year, with scant detail. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the failure to act on social care after the pandemic was ""nothing short of an insult to the whole nation"" and a missed opportunity to fix Britain. Debating the speech in the Commons, he added: ""Instead this Queen's Speech merely papers over the cracks. ""It's packed with short-term gimmicks and distant promises."" Also missing was a bill on dealing with the legacy of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, although Mr Johnson insisted legislation will be introduced. Issues around the treatment of veterans have been highly controversial amid suggestions any protection from prosecution offered to service personnel may also be extended to terrorists. Boris said the Government's legacy package will be focused on reconciliation and ending the ""cycle of investigations"". However, massive tax breaks will be dished out to bosses who employ veterans. Also, eight low-tax freeports will see national insurance holidays for three years. Mr Johnson declared: ""We One Nation Conservatives understand this crucial point; that you will find flair and imagination and enthusiasm and genius distributed evenly across this country while opportunity is not. ""And we mean to change that because it is not just a moral and social disgrace, it's an economic mistake, it's a criminal waste of talent. ""We must harness the ingenuity and resolve that has been revealed in the struggle against Covid-19 and use it to create a stronger, healthier and more prosperous nation."" HOUSING: Planning red tape will be cut to build homes quicker, ministers say. It will help developers, behind on their 300,000 homes annual target. New building laws will help to prevent another Grenfell fire disaster. And ground rents will also be banned for new properties, while rental reforms are brought forward. TECHNOLOGY: Fraudsters who try to catfish lovers out of their cash will face a crackdown under online harms laws. Websites will be responsible for taking tough action against fraudsters. Social media companies will also have to report, take down and limit the spread of illegal and harmful content — or face mammoth fines. TRANSPORT: Reform of rail and bus routes is planned by Boris Johnson based on lessons learned while London Mayor. He intends to take the blueprint of the London Overground network, feted in his time in charge of the capital, and roll it out across Britain. It is run by a private company but under direction of the local authority. ENVIRONMENT: The Sun's Show Some Bottle campaign got a boost as plans for a deposit return scheme were included in an Environment Bill. Ministers have asked industry leaders for their thoughts. Single use plastics items will be slapped with extra taxes from next year. BORDERS: Priti Patel's bold plans to tackle illegal immigration were included. The Home Secretary's tough measures will crack down on Channel-crossing migrants and make it easier to boot out foreign criminals. Migrants will also no longer be put up in hotels but instead processed in new immigration facilities. EDUCATION: A MAJOR shake-up is planned for the further education sector to help level up and retrain the nation. Every person will receive a lifetime skills guarantee — allowing them to get funding and enrol on courses. Ministers will also get new powers to intervene in failing colleges."
234,234,The Sun,Harry Cole,The Queen makes first public appearance since Duke’s death to unveil new powers to jail Russian and Chinese spies,"SWEEPING powers to jail Russian and Chinese spies are to be unveiled by The Queen today. The State Opening of Parliament marks Her Majesty's first public event since Prince Philip died last month. Long-awaited reforms to the Official Secrets Act will be outlined in the Queen's Speech. Her Majesty will attend Parliament this morning to unveil Boris Johnson's agenda for the coming months. Front and centre stage will be a Counter State Threats Bill. The changes will allow the UK to prosecute Russian, North Korean and Chinese hackers; Iranian spies who target the UK's Middle East bases and those caught spying at British embassies. The Prime Minister will also ""put rocket fuel"" under his levelling-up agenda and post-Covid bounce-back bid. A Skills Bill will unveil training and education funds to help the 50 per cent of youths who do not go to uni. Last night Mr Johnson said: ""These new laws are the rocket fuel we need to level up this country and ensure equal opportunities for all. ""I'm revolutionising the system so we can move past the outdated notion that there is only one route up the career ladder. Other measures include a bill to hold big tech firms accountable for internet hate. There will also be reforms to asylum and housing and legislation to protect free speech at universities. And anti-fraud measures could mean voters needing photo ID at polling stations. Last night, it was still up in the air as to whether a bill will be included to deliver on the manifesto promise that no one has to sell their home to pay for social care."
235,235,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha ClarkJonathan ReillyNick McDermott,"Boris Johnson unlocks Brits as overnight romps, drinking inside pubs and holidays get the green light","BORIS Johnson hailed the ""biggest step"" on the road to Covid freedom last night as indoor drinking and dining — and overnight romps — got the OK. The PM confirmed a major easing of lockdown from next Monday. People in England will be able to eat out, drink inside pubs and go to the cinema, while hotels and B&Bs can reopen. Hugs will be allowed as well as mixing indoors and staying overnight with no social distancing — ending the casual sex ban. It follows a downgrading of the Covid threat. Boris Johnson has urged everyone to take personal responsibility for their Covid safety. The PM said the time has finally come for us to choose what risks to take when getting close to others as we learn to live with coronavirus for ever. Mr Johnson said that instead of government edicts people can decide if they want to remain two metres from pals, meaning they can once again hug and shake hands — or get steamy. The lockdown lift came as latest data showed no deaths in England, Scotland or Northern Ireland on Sunday. The official Covid threat level was downgraded from four to three — meaning the virus is still in circulation but is at bay. Confirming the easing of restrictions, the PM declared we are on course for a June 21 Independence Day, when the remaining restrictions should be lifted. From next week everyone will be able to drink in a pub, eat in a restaurant, travel within Britain, mix indoors and stay overnight with no social distancing. It means an end to the casual sex ban slapped on Covid-ravaged Britain. Because the risk from the virus has plummeted, Mr Johnson said it was time to move away from strict rules governing what we can and cannot do. He said instead people must choose the level of risk they are prepared to take by mixing and getting close. Mr Johnson told a No 10 press conference that all the data supported the latest easing of restrictions, which he said amounted to ""a considerable step on the road to normality"". He added: ""And today we're taking a step toward that moment when we learn to live responsibly with Covid, when we cease eventually to rely on detailed government edicts and make our own decisions based on the best scientific advice about how best to protect our families and those around us."" His spokesman later added: ""Because of the success of the vaccine rollout and the public abiding by the rules, we are at the point where everyone can use their own personal judgment."" It means love-starved couples and singletons will finally be allowed to mix indoors with people they do not live with and get close to them. People longing for embraces will be allowed to hug and kiss once again, allowing relationships to blossom. Lonely couples who live in separate households will be legally allowed to sleep under the same roof again as domestic overnight stays are approved. Previously, only those who lived alone were allowed to form a bubble with their partner. Anyone else was forced to meet their loved ones outside only, and were meant to stay apart. But Mr Johnson had a warning for all those thinking of rushing out to dish out the hugs. He said: ""This doesn't mean that we can suddenly throw caution to the wind. We all know that close contacts such as hugging is a direct way of transmitting this disease. ""So I urge you to think about the vulnerability of your loved ones. ""Whatever you decide, I must ask you to continue to follow social distancing when not with friends and family, including in workplaces, shops, pubs, restaurants and other settings."" Mr Johnson also said cinemas and theatres will be allowed to reopen from next week. And public events, including gigs, could start happening again, although they would have a capacity limit of 1,000, or 50 per cent — whichever is the smaller number. Secondary school pupils will no longer have to wear masks while at their desks and in communal spaces like corridors. However, teachers and adult visitors will still be expected to cover up where social distancing is not possible. Despite Mr Johnson's plea for Brits to continue social distancing at work and in other settings, he said he was hopeful that those rules can become voluntary by the end of next month. He vowed to give an update on social distancing in the wider workplace and hospitality industry by the end of May. That delighted pub bosses and MPs who say hospitality cannot survive while social distancing remains and urged the PM to ditch it all together. According to the real estate adviser Altus Group, 99,045 indoor hospitality premises in England will be able to open their doors from next Monday. But the UK Hospitality group warned it still may not be economically viable for many of them to reopen without an end to social distancing rules. Boss Kate Nichols said: ""We know a third couldn't make it work to reopen last summer and that businesses which do open will not be able to break even with the current social distancing restrictions in place."" Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association, said: ""We know Brits cannot wait to get back inside a warm pub. ""However, inside opening with restrictions is still not enough to secure the survival of pubs. ""We need them to be fully reopened without any restrictions at all from June 21 to survive and trade viably."" Nik Antona, national chairman of the Campaign for Real Ale, said ""Whilst this next step is very welcome, we aren't out of the woods yet. ""Distancing and table-service only restrictions will still mean many pubs can't operate at full capacity with many continuing to struggle to make ends meet as a result."" Pub chiefs were backed last night by Tory MP Mark Harper, chairman of the influential Covid Recovery Group. He said: ""Getting rid of social distancing is crucial to the very survival of many sectors of our economy, such as hospitality, that simply cannot make any money and pay wages with social distancing in place, as well as to normal life. ""I also welcome the fact that the Prime Minister has made it clear that we will all have to learn to live with the virus, stop relying on Government edicts and make our own decisions about balancing risks in living our lives."""
236,236,The Sun,Jack ElsomHarry Cole,Cabinet ministers expect Boris Johnson to call an early election in spring 2023 – but insiders slap it down,"BORIS Johnson could call an early General Election after smashing Labour and riding high in the polls, Cabinet Ministers believe. Downing Street insists the PM is laser-focused on Covid-19 - but top Ministers told The Sun he could go to the country ""sooner rather than later"". Voters are next due to go the polls in December 2024, yet new powers will allow the PM to trigger a snap election with just a few weeks' notice. Insiders say spring 2023 has been touted as a possibility to ratchet pressure on Sir Keir Starmer to marshall support following disastrous local elections. But senior Tory sources also told The Sun the PM could ""go long"" as he wants more time for his levelling-up agenda to bear fruit. Others say the advent of postal votes and their 2019 election victory - where Britain went to the polls in darkest days of December - means the tradition of having elections in spring or summer is over. Jacob Rees-Mogg last night appeared to open the door to an early election by confirming the axing of the Fixed Terms Parliament Act. Efforts to repeal the Act are currently progressing through the House of Lords. The law, brought in by David Cameron, made it harder for prime ministers to call an election when it suited them. Leader of the Commons Mr Mogg told the BBC: ""I am glad to say the FTPA will be repealed. ""That's already been draft legislation and that is something we will be looking at in the next session."" Grilled if this would pave the way for an early poll, he replied: ""Subject to the normal conventions. The conventions will be restored alongside the Royal prerogative."" In 2019 Mr Johnson used a Commons vote, backed by Jeremy Corbyn, to get round the FTPA and announce the Brexit election. Fevered election speculation comes after last week's Super Thursday elections, where Tory candidates thrashed Labour in the party's former heartlands of Hartlepool, Tees Valley and the West Midlands. Grassroots Tory website ConservativeHome said there was ""nothing to discourage"" the PM from going to the country in Spring 2023. Reeling from the results, Sir Keir vowed to launch a soul-searching policy review as the party's radical lefties demanded he revert to Corbyism. The Labour leader tried to stamp his authority on the crisis by wielding the knife against members of his top team. But it was thrown into a tailspin when deputy Angela Rayner kicked up a stink at being sacked and triggered a furious internal briefing war."
237,237,The Sun,Harry Cole,Hugging and kissing allowed from May 17 — as Boris Johnson reveals Britain is ‘on track’ for return to normality,"FRIENDS and family will finally be able to hug and kiss from next week — with Boris Johnson revealing today Britain is ""on track"" for a return to normality. Loved ones will be able to hold each other for the first time in months after the Prime Minister confirms Covid-19 rates have sunk low enough to proceed to the next stage of lockdown lifting a week today. The penultimate phase will allow indoor mixing and increase the cap on outdoor get-togethers to 30. ""Friendly contact"" will also get the go-ahead in the first easing of social distancing measures. Hotels can reopen, alongside cinemas and theatres as well as indoor exercise classes. But people will still have to wear masks and stay 1.5 metres apart when meeting indoors unless they are with close family. This morning a cautious SAGE scientists warned that embraces should be kept to a minimum, and Brits should avoid face-to-face contact as much as they can to stay safe. Professor Cath Noakes, who sits on SAGE, has urged caution ahead of the relaxation, warning that too much hugging could ""perpetuate"" Covid's spread. Yet the PM has been warned that it would be ""morally wrong"" to keep such social distancing measures in bars, shops and offices beyond next month. Tory backbencher Steve Baker, from the Covid Recovery Group, an organisation of 50 MPs, claims that it is time now that ""freedom truly means freedom"". Step three of Mr Johnson's recovery plan will kick in next Monday after the latest virus data confirmed plummeting death rates and case levels. Yesterday there were just two confirmed deaths from the bug registered in the UK. Infection rates are at the lowest level since September and hospital admissions and patients continue to decrease or stay at low levels previously seen in July last year. The PM will meet with his Covid war committee on Monday morning to sign off scrapping the Rule of Six outdoors and giving the green-light to mixing indoors. Two households of any size, or six people from separate homes, will be allowed to come together in pubs and homes. Mr Johnson is preparing to address the nation this afternoon to confirm the further easing of restrictions in seven days' time. Last night he said: ""The data reflects what we already knew — we are not going to let this virus beat us. ""The road map remains on track, our successful vaccination programme continues — more than two-thirds of adults in the UK have now had the first vaccine — and we can now look forward to unlocking cautiously but irreversibly. ""It is because of the British public's unwavering commitment that we are saving lives, protecting the NHS and controlling the virus."" And yesterday Cabinet big beast Michael Gove confirmed ""intimate contact"" between family and friends will be restored from the expected May 17 date. He told the BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""All being well, the Prime Minister will confirm that there will be a relaxation. ""We have already indicated a proportionate relaxation on international travel, very limited at this stage because we have to be safe. ""In the same way, as we move into stage three of our road map, it will be the case that we will see people capable of meeting indoors. ""And without prejudice to a broader review of social distancing, it is also the case that friendly contact, intimate contact, between friends and family is something we want to see restored."" But Downing Street is to face growing pressure in the coming days to lift all social distancing restrictions in June. Ministers are currently reviewing the restrictive measures, but they will remain in place until further notice for office workers, shops, bars, pubs and in factories. Yet the fears are that keeping the restrictions risks hampering the economic bounce back from the financially draining pandemic. The Duchess of Cornwall has revealed she enjoyed ""half a hug"" with her grandchildren. Camilla, 73, made the surprise admission despite this being forbidden until Mr Johnson confirms that projected May 17 easing is official. She had spoken last year of the wish she had to hold her grandchildren once more. When asked if she had been able to do that more recently as Britain continues to reopen, she said: ""I have been able to. I have had a hug. I am doubly jabbed so we've had a sort of half a hug. ""It has been so lovely just to be able to see them again and talk to them. ""Telephones and machines and these Zooms are fine, but nothing is ever the same as being able to give somebody a good hug."" BORIS Johnson is set to announce today that hugging will soon be allowed again. However, scientists urge that to play safe, hugs should be short, avoid face-to-face contact and restricted to as few people as possible. Shouldn't be a problem — that sounds pretty much like the British method of hugging even before Covid."

The embattled Labour boss has sacked his Shadow Chancellor, Chief Whip and party chairman after the Super Thursday drubbing. Rachel Reeves has now been promoted to shadow chancellor as part of Sir Keir's reshuffle of his top team, with former incumbent Anneliese Dodds relegated to party chairman. Deputy leader Angela Rayner, fired as party chairman and elections co-ordinator on Saturday following Labour's shock Hartlepool by-election defeat, will take Ms Reeves' former post as shadow chancellor to the Duchy of Lancaster. Nick Brown has been replaced as shadow chief whip by Alan Campbell, while Thangam Debbonaire has been moved to shadow Commons leader. And Thangam Debbonaire has been moved to shadow Commons leader, replacing Valerie Vaz. Nia Griffith, the shadow Welsh Secretary, described the changes as ""musical chairs"", admitting: ""we would all have liked to have seen things go more smoothly"". Despite attempting to sack Angela Rayner, after a day of tense talks she emerged with the title: Deputy Leader, Shadow First Secretary of State, Shadow Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Shadow Secretary of State for the Future of Work. Her allies said the multiple jobs added up to a promotion, but Starmer's supporters rejected that as ""spin."" Sir Keir said: ""The Labour Party must be the party that embraces the demand for change across our country. ""That will require bold ideas and a relentless focus on the priorities of the British people. ""Just as the pandemic has changed what is possible and what is necessary, so Labour must change too."" On Sunday some of Labour's biggest beasts declared war after plans to demote the party's most prominent northern working class woman leaked early - sparking a botched 24 hour rejig effort. They publicly savaged Sir Keir, accusing him of ""scapegoating"" Angela Rayner by stripping her of the party's election planning role. As the party is embroiled in a civil war, ""King of the North"" Andy Burnham slammed the news Ms Rayner had been sacked as chairman of the party. The newly re-elected mayor of Greater Manchester said ""I can't support this"", as the campaigns co-ordinator was unceremoniously dismissed from office. And Liverpool MP Kim Johnson said the sacking was ""an appalling act of cowardice"". Former Home Secretary Diane Abbott slammed it as ""baffling"", adding ""we've not heard anywhere in the country people saying they didn't vote Labour because of Angela Rayner"". Ms Rayner's opponents in the party leaked details of her use of first-class rail tickets to the Sunday Times, with allies claiming it was for safety reasons. -- Rachel Reeves has replaced Anneliese Dodds as shadow chancellor. – Anneliese Dodds has replaced Angela Rayner as the party chair. – Alan Campbell has replaced Nick Brown as shadow chief whip. – Lucy Powell has replaced Thangam Debbonaire as shadow housing secretary. – Thangam Debbonaire has replaced Valerie Vaz as shadow leader of the House of Commons. – Wes Streeting's role as shadow minister for schools has been changed to child poverty secretary. – Angela Rayner, who is deputy leader of the Labour party, has become shadow first secretary, shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (taking the role from Rachel Reeves) and shadow secretary for the future of work. Labour MPs have begun to turn on Sir Keir as others appear to be getting the blame for key losses in former strongholds. Senior leftwing members told their leader to ""look in a mirror"", with an adviser telling the Telegraph: ""He seems out of control of himself. He seems to have lost any semblance of how to manage a political party, which is very similar to how Iain Duncan Smith became in the last days of his leadership. ""He is swinging like a punch drunk boxer on Saturday night."" It comes after Sir Keir said he would personally take the blame for the election failings. As well as undertaking a reshuffle, the former director of public prosecutions has also hired Gordon Brown's former chief pollster Deborah Mattinson - who has written a book about why Labour lost the so-called ""red wall"" at the 2019 general election - as director of strategy. Boris Johnson spanked Sir Keir Starmer in ""Super Thursday's"" elections — seizing the Red Wall jewel of Hartlepool and demolishing Labour across the country. The humiliated leftie boss took ""full responsibility"" for the ""bitterly disappointing"" results as he desperately scrambled to save his leadership and party from extinction. In an interview with Sky, Mr Burnham said he might have another go at becoming leader of the Labour party. He said: ""I feel I am in the best job in the world and we have a massive job ahead of us but I'm here to help the Labour Party if they need it - but they need to change, let's be really clear about this. ""They have lost an emotional connection with parts of the country that is going to take a lot of work to get back, so I think the party has to do a lot of soul-searching about these results and understand why we have done well in Wales, places like Greater Manchester, and it really needs to then buy in to English devolution and build from the bottom up - that's what these results are telling them."" Breaking his silence hours after the bombshell Hartlepool defeat, Sir Keir admitted he had failed to ""connect"" with voters. He added the ""bitterly disappointing"" defeats show Labour is hopelessly out of touch with working-class Brits. But he denied the party is facing a life or death battle for survival. Sir Keir said the party must stop ""quarrelling"" and tell Britons what it stands for. He said: ""The Labour Party has to rise to the challenge of reconnecting with working people."""
240,240,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson’s joy as one in three adults in England – 17.6million people – have had both Covid jabs,"ONE in three adults in England is now fully vaccinated against Covid. Around 17.6million have now had both jabs while more than 35million have had their first dose. Ministers are confident that July's target to offer every adult at least their first vaccine is in reach. Saturday alone saw 637,631 doses given out. Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted: ""One third of adults in the UK have now had their second dose of the Covid vaccine, a testament to the extraordinary efforts of NHS staff and volunteers. ""Thank you to everyone who has made this happen. Get your jab when called."" And last night scientists pinned the latest easing of restrictions directly to the success of Britain's vaccine rollout. Prof Andrew Pollard, the head of the Oxford University vaccine group, said the country has seen the ""extraordinary success"" of both the vaccination programme and the prolonged lockdown. He told BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""I think it is time to start, based on the very careful modelling that's been done, relaxing some of those restrictions. ""That means we're in a very fortunate position here in the UK."""
241,241,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor","Michael Gove tells Nicola Sturgeon ‘not now’, but not never as Government opens door to future Scottish referendum","MICHAEL Gove told Nicola Sturgeon ""not now"" in her bid for Scottish independence - but left the door open for a future referendum. After the SNP fell just short of majority in the Scottish Parliament elections, the Cabinet bigwig swerved questions on whether the Government would use the courts to block her vowed attempt to hold another vote on breaking up the UK. But notably he stopped short of outright rejection of another vote in a significant step back - instead he said now was not the time because of Covid. He told ITV Scotland it was ""not now"" for a second vote. The SNP fell one seat short of an overall majority during the Super Thursday elections, securing 64 seats in Holyrood. Eight seats for the Greens, also pro-independence, paves the way for Scotland to once more hold a vote for independence from Great Britain. But many fear the UK government would not give approval to hold a referendum, with Ms Sturgeon making her feelings clear on what that could mean. She slammed such a scenario as ""no longer a union based on consent"", continuing to the BBC: ""In this election they have voted overwhelmingly for the SNP and we stood on a manifesto commitment to firstly... continue to steer the country through the Covid pandemic. ""But after the crisis to give the people of Scotland the opportunity to choose our own future in a referendum. ""The fact that we are sitting here having a debate about whether or not that outcome is going to be respected says a lot about the lack of respect for Scottish democracy that this UK government has demonstrated for quite some time now."" But Mr Gove said the Scottish First Minister's failure to recapture the dizzy heights of 2011, when her predecessor and now rival Alex Salmond won a healthy 69-seat majority in Edinburgh, indicated there was not a fervour among the public for another independence poll. He told the BBC: ""It is not the case now - as we see - that the people of Scotland are agitating for a referendum."" And he insisted that ""it's not an issue for the moment"" and the SNP's focus on securing a second referendum was ""a slightly skewed set of priorities to imagine that that is the most important issue"". Instead he urged the SNP leader to ""concentrate on recovery"" from the coronavirus pandemic, following the Prime Minister's invitation for her and other devolved leaders to contribute to economic revival plans. Health minister Nadine Dorries also insisted the SNP chief should focus on the promise she made to voters to get on with building back from Covid rather an another ""expensive"" referendum. She said: ""When people asked her in Scotland 'we're not concerned about independence now, what we're concerned about is getting out the pandemic, who should we vote for?' Nicola Sturgeon said vote SNP. ""The recovery is not about legislating for another divisive, expensive referendum. It simply isn't on our radar. ""All we are focused on as a government, and frankly all Scotland should be focused on, is the recovery from the pandemic. ""We are still in the tail end of the pandemic in the UK, the world is still in the grips of this pandemic, we are not out of the woods yet. ""We should not be talking about a referendum, we should be talking about moving forward as a nation and recovering."" Today, Ms Sturgeon said she would be ""delighted"" to attend Boris Johnson's Covid summit, but warned she would push on with plans for another vote when the crisis has passed. With help from the Greens, there are enough separatist votes to get a referendum proposal through the Scottish Parliament, but it cannot go ahead legitimately without approval from Westminster. If the SNP government attempted to go ahead with the vote regardless, it would likely head to the Supreme Court to be rendered illegal. But Sturgeon hit back telling Andrew Marr, that any legal challenge to a referendum from the UK Government would be ""such a grave and serious and undemocratic situation that I don't believe, on either side, anybody wants it to get to that point"". Mr Gove repeatedly avoided saying that Westminster ministers could intervene via the Supreme Court to block legislation from the Scottish Parliament that attempts to engineer a second independence referendum, saying: ""We're not going near there."" But previously senior Tories have vowed to simply say no to another vote at any time. Ms Sturgeon, who said she ""wouldn't rule out"" putting legislation for a referendum before MSPs early next year, claimed a battle in the courts would be ""absurd and completely outrageous"". She told the BBC: ""In this election they have voted overwhelmingly for the SNP and we stood on a manifesto commitment to firstly... continue to steer the country through the Covid pandemic. ""But after the crisis to give the people of Scotland the opportunity to choose our own future in a referendum. ""The fact that we are sitting here having a debate about whether or not that outcome is going to be respected says a lot about the lack of respect for Scottish democracy that this UK Government has demonstrated for quite some time now."" WE'RE yet to see a development that Nicola Sturgeon is unable to spin into an excuse for a second independence referendum. And the SNP's success in last week's elections has undeniably given her extra ammo, despite more Scots overall voting for parties that oppose independence. However, there is good reason for Boris Johnson to kick the fizzing can of Irn-Bru as far down the road as possible, even after the pandemic is dealt with. If any IndyRef2 is delayed until Brexit has had a decade to bed in, Scots would still be leaping into the unknown by leaving the UK . . . but they might have a better idea what they'd be walking away from."

Labour's Khan was expected to return to City Hall by trouncing Tory Shaun Bailey and polls indicated a landslide. But both sides said early results showed the race was much closer than expected. As of 5.30pm yesterday, Mr Khan held around 39 per cent of first-round votes counted while Mr Bailey had 37 per cent. Tory sources said ballots were ""neck and neck"" in the half of the boroughs counted. But by the end of the night Mr Khan was almost 25,000 votes ahead over the Tory candidate. The hopefuls have been told the aim is for an 8.30pm declaration, but a decision will be made at 4pm if it needs to roll over to Sunday. Bailey has done far better than his party did in 2016. One insider said: ""It's closer than everyone thinks. Shaun will have beaten the polls by a fair whack."" A London Labour source added: ""We think it will be close. There is no chance of winning on the first round."" Labour said Mr Khan was missing out because the system allows voters to pick a first and second preference. The source said: ""We're seeing a big impact from a low turnout and voters thinking they can put a smaller party first preference and not influence the result."" Mr Khan is still favourite to win with the result expected later today. On the London Assembly fight, none have so far changed party control. Tories held three and Labour clung onto four, with seven more to be declared today. Meanwhile, No 10 was monitoring Scottish election results amid fears an SNP majority will lead to demands for a new independence vote. Speaking in Hartlepool, PM Boris Johnson said: ""I don't think people want much more constitutional wrangling. ""What the people of this country want to see is politicians of all kinds — in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, across the whole of the UK — working together to bounce back strongly from the pandemic."""
243,243,The Sun,Martin LiptonHarry Cole,"Boris Johnson calls on Uefa to allow UK to host Champs League final – with St James’, Tottenham and Emirates available","BORIS JOHNSON urged Uefa to switch the Champions League final to the UK - for the sake of the fans. Turkey will be on the UK's Covid 'red list', so Chelsea and Manchester City supporters face ten days' costly hotel quarantine on return from Istanbul after the May 29 spectacle. And PM Johnson told SunSport: ""The Champions League is the pinnacle of European club football. ""And with two English teams in the final, it would be a great shame if fans were unable to attend. ""It would be brilliant to host it here if we can. I want to help supporters of both clubs see their team in action."" Johnson's intervention strengthened hopes of the game being moved after Uefa were blindsided by the red-list decision and left considering a U-turn. If the game was played over here up to 15,000 fans could attend. The UK Government will grant clubs a quarantine exemption should the final remain at the Ataturk. That is a relief for England boss Gareth Southgate, who otherwise faced losing Phil Foden, Raheem Sterling, John Stones, Mason Mount and Ben Chilwell until four days before the June 13 opener against Croatia. There is no issue entering Turkey but English fans coming back would have to fork out nearly £2,000 EACH before being allowed back home. FREE BETS: GET OVER £2,000 IN SIGN UP OFFERS HERE And Transport Secretary Grant Shapps warned: ""It does mean fans should not travel to Turkey. The FA are in discussions with Uefa already. ""We are very open to hosting the final but that's ultimately for Uefa. ""We already have a successful record of matches with spectators and given two English clubs are in that final we look forward to hearing what Uefa say."" Uefa were planning to allow up to 6,000 fans from each club at the game, now scheduled to have a crowd of 25,000. But Turkey is in the grip of a new Covid wave of the virus. Uefa chief Aleksander Ceferin has thanked Johnson for helping save football from the threat of the breakaway Super League last month. Government legal threats helped persuade Big Six rebels to heed the fan backlash and quit the £4.6billion project. Ceferin said: ""Boris Johnson is aware football fans are  working class. The reaction was very logical — he cared what happened to football, because that would affect the people, of course. The Government's threat of a ""legislative bombshell"" helped persuade the Big Six rebels to heed the fan backlash and turn their backs on the £4.6bn project. And Ceferin, who spoke directly with the PM, said: ""Boris Johnson is aware that football fans are from the working class. ""They live hard, and they spend the last money to watch football matches, which is their passion, relaxation, which is part of European culture, part of history. ""It seemed to me the reaction was very logical - he cared what happened to football, because that would affect the people, of course. ""It was very responsible from the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to take a sharp stand on the side of the fans, not only because of the culture and love of football, but also because it ensures order in the country."" Johnson also contacted Uefa to offer up the UK as an option for staging extra matches at Euro 2020, although in the event there will be just one extra last 16 knock-out tie at Wembley. ""It was very responsible from the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to take a sharp stand on the side of the fans."" Johnson also offered up the UK as an option for staging extra Euros games but there will be just one extra last-16 Wembley tie. Any CL final move would be welcomed by Chelsea and City fans, who are facing a four-hour flight each way, costs of hotels and match tickets —  and now that quarantine. Wembley is being used for the Play-Off Finals on the weekend of the Champions League showpiece. But Uefa had been offered the use of St James' Park for the Euros by the FA, with other options including the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium or The Emirates."
244,244,The Sun,Harry ColeKate Ferguson,Boris Johnson spanks Sir Keir Starmer in ‘Super Thursday’s’ elections — seizing Hartlepool and demolishing Labour,"BORIS Johnson spanked Sir Keir Starmer in ""Super Thursday's"" elections — seizing the Red Wall jewel of Hartlepool and demolishing Labour across the country. The humiliated leftie boss took ""full responsibility"" for the ""bitterly disappointing"" results as he desperately scrambled to save his leadership and party from extinction. After a brutal year of pandemic ups and downs, the Prime Minister is riding high with an earthquake 7,000 majority win in the North East town that has had a Labour MP since 1974. The stunning victory saw the Tories overturn a majority of 3,500, with Labour slumping nine per cent since 2019. It was the biggest by-election win by a party in government since the Second World War. Jubilant BoJo travelled to Hartlepool to hail it as a mandate for his ""levelling up agenda"" and proof of the success of his Brexit deal. He told well-wishers: ""This is a place that voted for Brexit, and we got Brexit done."" Attempting to draw a line in the sand after weeks of sleaze allegations, Mr Johnson vowed to rebuild the Covid-battered economy. He said: ""Priority No 1 is continuing the vaccine rollout, making sure that we go from jabs, jabs, jabs to jobs, jobs, jobs — make sure that we have a strong economic recovery."" Harlow MP Robert Halfon said: ""We are the true workers' party now. And the Boris brand works – he is liked by people in a way that Labour do not understand."" New Tory MP Jill Mortimer gained 15,529 votes — more than half the total cast. Labour's Dr Paul Williams, who wanted a second referendum, trailed behind on 8,589. The Tories also made stonking gains in vital local council fights as well as a victory for Ben Houchen to stay Tees Valley Mayor. Tory council wins included bellwether authorities Harlow in Essex, Cornwall, Dudley, Nuneaton and Bedworth, Nottinghamshire and Northumberland. It is thought the party could win 36 more Labour seats in a general election. The Conservatives are advancing in the very areas Starmer would need if he has any hope of reaching No10. But the Labour boss is doing even worse than Jeremy Corbyn. Both left and right within the party called for a change in tactics. Finally breaking his silence nine hours after the bombshell Hartlepool defeat, Sir Keir admitted he had failed to ""connect"" with voters. He added the ""bitterly disappointing"" defeats show Labour is hopelessly out of touch with working class Brits. But he denied the party is facing a life or death battle for survival. Sir Keir said the party must stop ""quarrelling"" and tell Britons what it stands for. He said: ""The Labour Party has to rise to the challenge of reconnecting with working people. ""We were set up to represent working people, we need to reconnect, rebuild that trust. ""That means learning the lessons of the results that are in, and putting a much stronger and bolder case to the country."" But the hard-left were sharpening their knives. Corbynista MPs and union chiefs darkly warned that Sir Keir will be out of a job unless he ditches his ""flag waving"" and becomes more left wing than his predecessor. John McDonnell furiously accused him of sending Labour candidates out ""naked"" with no real policies. Unite boss ""Red"" Len McCluskey branded the losses ""staggering"". Corbynista MP Clive Lewis added: ""The leadership, Keir Starmer, will have to answer some very tough questions about why we are where we are."" Andrew Scattergood — boss of the Momentum group which installed Corbyn — said Sir Keir had ""failed"". He added: ""If he doesn't change direction, not only will he be out of a job — but the Labour Party may be out of government forever."" Labour moderates furiously hit back — blaming the historic defeat on the toxic effects of ""long Corbyn"". They said Starmer must go faster and harder in tacking to the right and booting out hard-left elements. Labour insiders told The Sun that Sir Keir should do a Kinnock and ""stand up"" to the party's unpatriotic hard-left rump. Big beast Peter Mandelson — a former Hartlepool MP — warned yet more of the Red Wall will crumble if Labour does not transform itself. The former minister said he felt ""mild fury"" at the defeats — and warned Labour must not go back to the ""la la land"" of the Corbyn years. He said: ""We have not won a General Election in 16 years. We have lost the last four, with 2019 a catastrophe. ""The last 11 General Elections read — lose lose lose lose Blair Blair Blair lose lose lose lose. Natasha Clark DOMINIC Cummings risked a fresh row with Boris Johnson last night - after giving Sir Keir Starmer advice on how to WIN. The PM's former adviser was spewing his thoughts on the latest election results on Twitter. He took a swipe at the Labour boss for obsessing about the media and having no message to the country. But what he really should be doing is focusing on the ""public priorities"" and the reality of every day voters. Taking to Twitter, he said: ""If LAB had a leader 80% as good at comms as Blair + focused on ActualReality, they'd win next GE easy."" He said that the Labour boss should focus a ""sustained effort on violent crime"" month after month - and hire a crack team of experts and advisers from outside the media bubble. Mr Cummings, who was embroiled in a fresh war with No10 over a series of damning leaks last month, said it ""won't happen"" and the Labour boss is doomed to failure. ""We need to learn the lessons of those victories as well as those defeats."" Phil Wilson, who lost his seat as MP for Sedgefield in 2019, blamed ""long Corbyn"" and urged Sir Keir to ""plant a flag"" spelling out his vision for a greater Britain. He told The Sun: ""I don't believe that anybody who hasn't got a belief in the country belongs in the party. ""It should be that if you vote Labour, you vote for the United Kingdom."" Victorious Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen told The Sun the Tories face a crunch three years if the are to maintain support in the new Blue Wall. He said: ""Nothing is set in stone, nothing is solidified, there is no new normal at the minute. ""There is a big opportunity — if we get this right we could see the solidification of the Conservative vote in places like Teesside and across the North. ""But if we get it completely wrong and the Government doesn't deliver what it started and we don't continue what we started, it can easily be undone."" Mr Houchen also revealed BoJo sent him a voicemail congratulating him on his win — and said that he will be celebrating with a drink in a pub beer garden."
245,245,The Sun,Jonathan ReillyHarry Cole,Green list countries: Brits set for quarantine-free holidays to Malta and Israel – but not to France and Spain,"HOLIDAYMAKERS are set to be given the 'green' light to go abroad without having to quarantine — but only to Israel, Malta and Gibraltar. However, hopes of a summer break in Portugal have soared, with ministers poised to also put the popular destination on England's approved list in the traffic light system. It came as TV's Holly Willoughby, 40, told of her joy over the UK's vaccine rollout as she got her jab. Whitehall insiders said that ""bar a last-minute change"", Portugal has been declared safe by both government medics and transport chiefs. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is due to reveal the full list of Covid-secure destinations from May 17 at a Downing Street press conference today. Most popular destinations such as France, Spain and Greece are likely to be 'amber,' so holidaymakers will need to take two PCR tests during their ten-day quarantine at home. But ministers are confident they will also go green in time for the summer rush. Airlines have already started ramping up prices to Portugal for flights the week legal trips can resume. Ryanair journeys to Lisbon have jumped from £15 on May 16 to £152 the day the holidays are getting the go-ahead. British Airways is charging £530 for a flight from Heathrow to the Algarve on May 17, which is when the ban on foreign holidays will be lifted for people in England. Flying the same route two days earlier costs just £234. PM Boris Johnson and his Cabinet were set to sign off the plan to carve up the world into green, amber and red regions depending on their Covid risk on Thursday. Destinations deemed safe will be 'green', meaning tourists will have to take a test before they depart, and a second two days after they come home — but not quarantine. Those coming back from 'red' countries will still have to fork out £1,750 to quarantine in a government-approved hotel. As the successful vaccine rollout continued at home, telly star Holly described the emotional experience of getting the jab - but joked she felt ""left out"" because she did not experience any side effects. Speaking on ITV's This Morning, she confirmed she received her first dose on Wednesday. She said: ""It's quite an emotional experience, isn't it? ""There's sort of a real atmosphere that we're all finally getting that vaccination that we've wanted and you're sort of on the road to being completely safe and protected."" Co-host Phillip Schofield, 59 said he felt fine but had a ""slightly bruised arm"" when he had his, prompting his co-star to say: ""I haven't even had that, I feel positively left out."" With freedom hopes soaring here, the traffic light system will be based on measures including the proportion of a country's population vaccinated, rates of infection and emerging new variants. Gibraltar, which has vaccinated its entire population, is a dead cert to be green. And Malta is even offering to pay 100 euros to the first 35,000 visitors. As The Sun revealed last month, every passenger arriving in the UK will be required to take a test, with the result entered into a passenger locator form. Passengers who refuse or fail to complete the digital paperwork will be barred from getting on the plane, train or ferry and face a hefty fine. Mr Shapps is expected to confirm that travellers from England will be able to pack a free NHS rapid test to take before they come home to help slash the testing cost. But every arrival will have to take a gold standard PCR test — booked before the holiday — at least two days after coming home. The private tests will be used to catch and stop any vaccine-busting variants from entering the UK and usually cost around £120, although some providers on the government list are dropping to around £45. There will be no exemptions for fully vaccinated punters. But Tui, the UK's largest hols firm, announced it will offer customers tests for a fraction of standard prices. The cheapest package, aimed at people returning from green destinations, will be available for just £20, and consist of the rapid lateral flow test and a PCR. A £50 package will be available for those coming back from amber countries. Rory Boland, editor of magazine Which? Travel, said the announcement of £20 packages was ""great news - but only for Tui customers"". He urged the Government to ""reduce the cost of testing across the board, rather than have consumers rely on a system that is currently fragmented and flawed"". It emerged those trying to return from red list countries are skipping the mandatory hotel quarantine by staying in Turkey instead. Tour operators are offering packages which let passengers stay there for at least ten days — so they can isolate at home on their return."
246,246,The Sun,Harry ColeNick PisaAdam Bennett,Jersey fishing: Royal Navy warships see off blockade and send 56-strong fleet of French boats packing,"TWO Royal Navy warships saw off a blockade of Jersey — sending packing a 56-strong flotilla of furious French fishermen. HMS Tamar and HMS Severn kept the peace after being sent by the PM. France had threatened to cut off supplies in a licence row. Relieved islanders saluted the Royal Navy for seeing off the French fishing boats. Local dad-of-two Alex Pacheco, 59, said: ""Hooray for the Royal Navy. They came and kicked their ass. ""It's great to see the French sloping off with their tails between their legs."" Local fisherman Josh Dearing, 28, added his thanks too, explaining: ""We're completely unprotected in Jersey. We've got nothing except for a few police officers."" He said the French show of force at the port of St Helier yesterday morning was ""like an invasion"". Josh added: ""The French can be hostile. All of our livelihoods are in that harbour and if they wanted to they could cause damage."" The Navy ships patrolled the waters after France threatened to ""bring Jersey to its knees"" by cutting off supplies and even power. French fishermen are in a bitter Brexit row over access to British fishing waters and threatened to ""restage the Battle of Trafalgar"". But their 56-strong flotilla was no match for the 2,000-ton warships. The gunboats dwarfed them and the 42-year-old, 100-ton French Navy boat sent to monitor the growing tensions as the spat over fishing licences threatened to boil over. The trawlermen retreated — clearing the way for other vessels to bring supplies to the island's only harbour. And last night HMS Tamar and HMS Severn were ordered home. A Government spokesman declared: ""We are pleased that French fishing boats have now left the vicinity of Jersey. ""Given the situation is resolved for now, the Royal Navy Offshore Patrol Vessels will prepare to return to port in the UK. We remain on standby to provide any further assistance Jersey requests."" Boris Johnson had dispatched the Navy late on Wednesday after receiving intelligence warnings the French boats were coming. The PM offered his ""unequivocal support for Jersey"" after speaking to the island's authorities as the row escalated. He warned that ""any blockade would be completely unjustified"". Supermarket bosses on the island had warned of food shortages if the blockade was not broken. The flotilla descended on the harbour at dawn — letting off flares and blocking Jersey boatmen from sailing out. But local fisherman Kevin Singleton got one over on the French by setting sail at 3am — two hours before they arrived. Kevin, 31, managed to get in a full morning at sea before slipping back in between the French boats to unload his 200kg catch of scallops, crabs and lobsters. He said: ""I'd heard about the French coming. I thought I'm not going to let them beat me so got up extra early."" The flotilla descended on the harbour at dawn — letting off flares and blocking Jersey boatmen from sailing out. The French were stirred up by David Sellam, the sabre-rattling head of Normandy's port authority, who warned ""we're ready for war. We can bring Jersey to its knees"". The British ships were armed with 20mm and 30mm cannon, which can fire 700 rounds a minute at a range of 1,300 yards. France's President Macron hit back and sent two French Navy patrol boats — despite one being less than half the size of each Royal Navy vessel. Just after 1pm the French trawlers started to retreat but crews warned ""next time will be war"". They went home ""angry and disappointed"" after talks with officials in Jersey and called on the French Government to carry out their threats of ""retaliatory measures"". Jean-Claude La Vaullée, skipper of Le Cach, said: ""I've refuelled the boat — we're ready to restage the Battle of Trafalgar."" Last night Brussels stirred the row by taking the fishermen's side. The EU said Jersey's authorities were imposing ""additional conditions"" on French fishing boats operating there, in breach of the terms of the Brexit divorce agreement hammered out late last year. Marc Delahaye, of the Committee of Normandy Fisheries, said: ""We've made our feelings known. Now it is for Paris and Brussels to sort out. ""The French trawlers will not return to Jersey on Friday but things may change unless the matter is resolved."" Jersey's assistant environment minister, Deputy Gregory Guida, led 90 minutes of talks with the French fishermen's representatives yesterday. He said: ""Jersey should be bracing itself for more trouble. We'll do our best but I think it will get worse before it gets better."" A Government spokesman said: ""Jersey authorities have a right to regulate fisheries in their waters under this agreement. We support them in exercising those rights."""
247,247,The Sun,Harry ColeAdam BennettNick GutteridgeAbe Hawken,"Jersey supermarkets will be EMPTY in just two days unless Royal Navy breaks French trawler blockade, bosses warn","SUPERMARKET bosses in Jersey have warned shelves will be empty by Saturday unless the Royal Navy can stop French trawlers blockading the island's port. Stocks of bread, fruit, fresh meat and vegetables will be gone if freight ships cannot deliver their crucial daily supplies, CEO of Jersey Co-op Mark Cox said. Mr Cox said the island is relying on the Royal Navy ships HMS Severn and HMS Tamar to make sure the French boats back off. The last freight ship, Commodore Goodwill, arrived in Jersey at 4.30am and there is another scheduled for tonight, but supermarket chiefs fear it may not get through. Mr Cox told The Sun: ""The port is a lifeline to the island and it is absolutely critical that the freight vessels can get into the port. ""It's vital that those routes are kept clear, the shelves will be bare within two days if the port is blocked. ""It's the short dated products and the fresh food which will go first such as bread, vegetables, fresh meat and fruit. ""While we do grow food here, it's not enough to service the island as a whole. ""At this stage we are reliant on the Royal Navy to keep the freight ships coming into the island on a daily basis."" It's vital that those routes are kept clear, the shelves will be bare within two days if the port is blocked."" Meanwhile, farmers have warned the blockade could lead to a potato shortage as it could cause potential delays in shipments of the Jersey Royals potatoes. Nigel Holliday, the commercial director at the Jersey Royal Company told the Telegraph  if the ferry from St Helier to Portsmouth is unable to travel it would mean that the orders would have to be cancelled. Under normal circumstances, the company harvests during the day and sends the shipment with the later ferry at 5pm. ""If we knew the ferry wasn't going to sail, we would tell the teams to stop harvesting the potatoes … because we don't really have any other way of sending them to the UK,"" he said. He added that the blockade could be a ""major disruption"", and potentially lead to lost sales. ""Jersey Royals don't have a very long shelf life,"" he said. ""We just have to assess the crop and see how we manage over the next 48 hours. It all depends how long this is going to go on for."" President of the Jersey Farmers Union, Peter Le Maistre, said it ""would be very inconvenient if the lifeline was interrupted"". It comes as a French Navy patrol boat today raced to Jersey as tensions rise after the Royal Navy was called to the ""act of war"" blockade by 100 ships. Angry French fishermen set off flares as dozens of boats began steaming in just after 6am as the huge row over post-Brexit fishing rights intensifies. Two Royal Navy gunships - HMS Severn and HMS Tamar - dramatically stepped in this morning after being deployed by Boris Johnson following the threat of a French blockade. They are armed with a 20mm cannon, which can fire 700 rounds a minute at a range of 1300 yards, and can travel at up to 20 knots. Tense video footage shows one of the gunships keeping watch and patrolling the harbour as French vessels protest near the capital Saint Helier. But just before 9am, Emmanuel Macron sent Navy patrol vessel Athos to the island in a dramatic twist. The French 95ft patrol vessel is less than half of the size of each of the Royal Navy gunships. Marine traffic data maps show their vessel heading towards the island from the east - while the British ships are currently patrolling the south west side. Locals said tensions are running ""very high"" today as footage shows boats descending on the small island - just 14 miles from the French coast. Jersey fisherman Josh Dearing described the scene at the port of St Helier on Thursday morning as ""like an invasion"". The 28-year-old said: ""There were a few hand-held flares and smoke flares going off and apparently a few maybe bangers and stuff going off from the French."" He said the French fleet was mostly made up of ""big French dredgers and trawlers"" of about 12 metres or more. Mr Dearing added: ""It was quite a sight. It was impressive, I looked from the shore this morning and it was just like a sea of red lights and flares already going off at sea. It was like an invasion."" What we know so far: He said there had been rumblings about a planned protest a few days ago but he had not been sure if it was ""serious or empty threats"". He added: ""The French being the French, they don't mess around. They can blockade their own harbours – they wouldn't think twice about coming and doing it to us."" Mr Dearing said he was ""absolutely"" pleased to hear on Wednesday night that Royal Navy vessels were being deployed to patrol the waters around Jersey. He said: ""We're completely unprotected in Jersey. We've got nothing except for a few police officers. We don't have a police boat, we don't have a navy boat, we don't have anything to protect us. ""The French can be hostile. All of our livelihoods are in that harbour and if they wanted to they could cause damage."" Boris' dramatic move came after French fishermen - backed by Emmanuel Macron's ministers - vowed to shut off the island unless they could fish more British waters, a threat branded an ""act of war"". I looked from the shore this morning and it was just like a sea of red lights and flares already going off at sea. It was like an invasion."" The furious spat erupted after the island - which is under Britain's protection - slapped French trawlers with post-Brexit fishing licence requirements. Following today's blockade, UK ministers are now said to be drawing up plans to ""retaliate"" by reviewing energy links with France. According to the Telegraph, Britain could buy electricity from the Netherlands instead. Meanwhile, government sources have accused the French of sinking lower than the island's Nazi occupiers in the Second World War. A source told the Telegraph: ""At least when the Germans invaded they kept the lights on.""

He said: ""All they want is to see the French fishing effort reduced and they profit from Brexit. ""If we want peace, let's prepare for war… If we want to bring the Jersey fishery to its knees, we can do it."" The furious cross-Channel bust-up escalated after one of Macron's key allies threatened to pull the plug on the tiny island's electricity and French fisherman vowed to blockade ports to cut off food and medicine. If we want peace, let's prepare for war… If we want to bring the Jersey fishery to its knees, we can do it."" French Maritime Minister Annick Girardin threatened to cut off the island's power of which 95 per cent is generated on the continent and supplied by three underwater cables. She blasted: ""We are ready to use these retaliation measures. I am sorry it has come to this. We will do so if we have to."" On Thursday morning, French fishermen were bracing themselves to ""restage the battle of Trafalgar"" as they prepared to take on the Royal Navy. Jean-Claude La Vaullée, skipper of Le Cach, said: ""I've refuelled the boat – we're ready to restage the Battle of Trafalgar."" The furious Mr La Vaullée, who has been fishing off Jersey for more than 40 years, said he had now been given the right to ""11 hours fishing a year"" in the area. Ms Girardin on Wednesday accused Jersey, the largest of the Channel Islands, of refusing to issue adequate new licences to her country's fishermen. Bertrand Sorre, France's English Channel MP, said: ""This unilateral decision by Jersey is totally illegal. ""We have been subject to the whims of the United Kingdom for too long. The European Commission must do its job."" Head of fisheries for the Normandy region, Dimitri Rogoff, said the French fishing vessels launched the blockade as part of a protest against the new rules. The two Navy vessels have been sent to monitor the situation and protect the islands 100,000 citizens who depend wholly on imports for food, medicine and even electricity. I've refuelled the boat – we're ready to restage the Battle of Trafalgar."" HMS Severn, which has previously been used to shadow Russian navy warships, arrived near Jersey in the early hours of this morning. HMS Tamar joined shortly after. Following crisis talks with the island's leadership, Downing Street said: ""The Prime Minister underlined his unwavering support for Jersey. ""He said that any blockade would be completely unjustified. As a precautionary measure the UK will be sending two Offshore Patrol Vessels to monitor the situation. ""They agreed the UK and Jersey Governments would continue to work closely on this issue."" The Royal Navy ships were first deployed soon after the UK finally departed the EU at the beginning of the year - again to ward off French trawlers. After France warned it would be ""brutal and difficult"" unless their boats got better access, Britain branded the comments ""surprising and disappointing, especially from a close neighbour."" David Sellam, head of the joint Normany-Brittany sea authority, claimed Jersey had been taken over by an ""trustworthy"" and ""extremist fringe, who want to reduce French fishing access and profit from Brexit"". ""We're ready for war. We can bring Jersey to its knees if necessary,"" he raged. The UK called the menacing words ""surprising and disappointing"" - but Jersey boatmen warned blocking St Helier would be an ""act of war"". It would be an act of war A government spokesman added: ""To threaten Jersey like this is clearly unacceptable and disproportionate. ""This is just the latest example of the EU issuing threats as a first resort at any sign of difficulty."" As tensions mounted, Boris Johnson was urged to send in Navy observers by the boss of the Commons Defence Committee. Tobias Ellwood slammed France's ""shameful behaviour"" and pleaded for calm. The ex-defence minister added: ""It would be wise to dispatch a Royal Navy Off Shore Patrol Vessel to the area to observe and report."" St Helier is Jersey's only port, which is narrow and would only take a handful of 150-ton French trawlers to block. But local fisherman Steve Viney, 55, told The Sun: ""It would be an act of war, it would be amazing to see the French try but I think they would be disappointed when they arrived and realised we won't stand for it. ""The fact that the EU is threatening an island is off the scale, they like to think they are civilised but clearly that's not true because this is something that Russia or China might do."" Murray Norton, chief executive of Jersey Chamber of Commerce, said the French have been heavy handed in their threats. Mr Norton said: ""The French threats are disproportionate considering we are talking about only a handful of fishing licences which are in dispute. Jersey's External Affairs Minister, Ian Gorst, said the French have made clear their ""frustration"" over the new Brexit trade deal. He told BBC News: ""There is some frustration in France, and they've made it clear to us, around the terms of the new trade deal. ""But we are in a new era of relationship with the European Union. That is governed by the Brexit trade deal and we believe that it can serve our interest as well as the interests of French fishermen into the future. ""We cannot look back to the previous arrangements. They have gone. We must make the new trade deal work in all of our interests."" No10 said France should lodge a complaint using the dispute mechanism set up in last year's Brexit deal if it has a problem rather than immediately making threats. A UK Government spokesman said:  ""We are working closely with the EU and Jersey on fisheries access provisions following the end of the Transition Period, so trust the French will use the mechanisms of our new treaty to solve problems."" A Whitehall insider added: ""They should be using the mechanisms of our new Treaty to solve problems - that is exactly what it is there for.""

248,248,The Sun,Harry ColeKate Ferguson,Boris Johnson and ‘boring’ Keir Starmer trade blows ahead of local elections & Hartlepool by-election,"BORIS Johnson and Sir Keir Starmer traded blows last night — before voters headed to the polls today. The struggling Labour leader faces the public at the ballot box for the first time, with his party enemies already sharpening their knives. One leading figure on the Labour left says Sir Keir is ""boring"" and ""lacks pizzazz"". The Tories are on course to thump Labour in its traditional heartlands of the Midlands and the North. Labour is desperate to claw back voters in those strongholds who switched to the Tories in 2019. But polls show Sir Keir is on course to be humiliated by losing the Hartlepool by-election — a must-hold seat for Labour if it is to have any hope of recovery. However, Downing Street fears a big victory for Nicola Sturgeon in Scotland. Britain faces years of wrangling over Scots independence if she wins a majority and uses it to seek another referendum. In today's polling, dubbed Super Thursday, more than 5,000 council seats are also up for grabs in England, as well as a host of mayoralties, including those in London, Birmingham and Teesside. Last night, after days of sleaze allegations from Sir Keir, the PM accused him of being obsessed with ""political games"". And Mr Johnson urged voters to reward a Government that ""continues to focus on the people's priorities""."
249,249,The Sun,Harry ColeAdam BennettNick GutteridgeAbe Hawken,French boats RETREAT away from Jersey but warn ‘next time will be war’ after Royal Navy gunboats called to blockade,"FRENCH fishing boats have finally retreated from Jersey, but warned ""next time there will be war"" as the Royal Navy was called to the blockade by 100 ships. Angry French fishermen set off flares as dozens of boats began steaming in just after 6am as the huge row over post-Brexit fishing rights intensifies. Two Royal Navy gunships - HMS Severn and HMS Tamar - dramatically stepped in this morning after being deployed by Boris Johnson following the threat of a French blockade. They are armed with a 20mm cannon, which can fire 700 rounds a minute at a range of 1,300 yards. Just after 1pm the fishing boats started to retreat away from the island - just 14 miles off the French coast. But defiant French fishermen issued a call to arms and vowed to return. The Navy boats have now ordered back to port on the mainland after the fishermen limped home. One is on its way and the other will leave the area on Friday morning. A Government spokesman said: ""We are pleased that French fishing boats have now left the vicinity of Jersey. ""Given the situation is resolved for now, the Royal Navy Offshore Patrol Vessels will prepare to return to port in the UK. We remain on standby to provide any further assistance Jersey requests."" A crewman called Popeye told The Telegraph: ""We will go back, and next time it will be war."" Tense video footage from earlier in the day showed one of the Royal Navy gunships keeping watch and patrolling the harbour as French vessels protest near the capital Saint Helier. Emmanuel Macron then sent Navy patrol vessel Athos to the island in a dramatic twist. And just before noon, a second French Navy vessel, Themis, was spotted heading towards Jersey. This afternoon, Mr Johnson offered his ""unequivocal support for Jersey"" as the fishing row escalated. Warning ""any blockade would be completely unjustified"", Mr Johnson vowed the navy vessels would ""remain in place"" after being scrambled to patrol the Channel waters. Locals said tensions are running ""very high"" today as footage shows boats descending on the small island - just 14 miles from the French coast. Jersey fisherman Josh Dearing described the scene at the port of St Helier on Thursday morning as ""like an invasion"". The 28-year-old said: ""There were a few hand-held flares and smoke flares going off and apparently a few maybe bangers and stuff going off from the French."" He said the French fleet was mostly made up of ""big French dredgers and trawlers"" of about 12 metres or more. Mr Dearing added: ""It was quite a sight. It was impressive, I looked from the shore this morning and it was just like a sea of red lights and flares already going off at sea. It was like an invasion."" What we know so far: He said there had been rumblings about a planned protest a few days ago but he had not been sure if it was ""serious or empty threats"". He added: ""The French being the French, they don't mess around. They can blockade their own harbours – they wouldn't think twice about coming and doing it to us."" Mr Dearing said he was ""absolutely"" pleased to hear on Wednesday night that Royal Navy vessels were being deployed to patrol the waters around Jersey. He said: ""We're completely unprotected in Jersey. We've got nothing except for a few police officers. We don't have a police boat, we don't have a navy boat, we don't have anything to protect us. ""The French can be hostile. All of our livelihoods are in that harbour and if they wanted to they could cause damage."" Boris' dramatic move came after French fishermen - backed by Emmanuel Macron's ministers - vowed to shut off the island unless they could fish more British waters, a threat branded an ""act of war"". I looked from the shore this morning and it was just like a sea of red lights and flares already going off at sea. It was like an invasion."" The furious spat erupted after the island - which is under Britain's protection - slapped French trawlers with post-Brexit fishing licence requirements. Following today's blockade, UK ministers are now said to be drawing up plans to ""retaliate"" by reviewing energy links with France. According to the Telegraph, Britain could buy electricity from the Netherlands instead. Meanwhile, government sources have accused the French of sinking lower than the island's Nazi occupiers in the Second World War. A source told the Telegraph: ""At least when the Germans invaded they kept the lights on."" HMS Tamar (P233) DISPLACEMENT: 2,000 tonnes LENGTH: 296ft 11in TOP SPEED: 25 knots POWER: 14,700 kW (19,700HP) RANGE: 5,500 nautical miles ARMAMENT: 1x Bushmaster 30mm cannon, 2x General purpose machine guns. 2 x Mini Guns CREW: 60 HMS Severn (P282) DISPLACEMENT: 1,677 tonnes LENGTH: 260ft 10in TOP SPEED: 20 knots POWER: 125 kW (5,352HP) RANGE: 7,800 nautical miles ARMAMENT: 1x Oerlikon 20 mm cannon, 2x General purpose machine guns.

He said: ""All they want is to see the French fishing effort reduced and they profit from Brexit. ""If we want peace, let's prepare for war… If we want to bring the Jersey fishery to its knees, we can do it."" The furious cross-Channel bust-up escalated after one of Macron's key allies threatened to pull the plug on the tiny island's electricity and French fisherman vowed to blockade ports to cut off food and medicine. If we want peace, let's prepare for war… If we want to bring the Jersey fishery to its knees, we can do it."" French Maritime Minister Annick Girardin threatened to cut off the island's power of which 95 per cent is generated on the continent and supplied by three underwater cables. She blasted: ""We are ready to use these retaliation measures. I am sorry it has come to this. We will do so if we have to."" On Thursday morning, French fishermen were bracing themselves to ""restage the battle of Trafalgar"" as they prepared to take on the Royal Navy. Jean-Claude La Vaullée, skipper of Le Cach, said: ""I've refuelled the boat – we're ready to restage the Battle of Trafalgar."" The furious Mr La Vaullée, who has been fishing off Jersey for more than 40 years, said he had now been given the right to ""11 hours fishing a year"" in the area. Ms Girardin on Wednesday accused Jersey, the largest of the Channel Islands, of refusing to issue adequate new licences to her country's fishermen. Bertrand Sorre, France's English Channel MP, said: ""This unilateral decision by Jersey is totally illegal. ""We have been subject to the whims of the United Kingdom for too long. The European Commission must do its job."" Head of fisheries for the Normandy region, Dimitri Rogoff, said the French fishing vessels launched the blockade as part of a protest against the new rules. The two Navy vessels have been sent to monitor the situation and protect the islands 100,000 citizens who depend wholly on imports for food, medicine and even electricity. I've refuelled the boat – we're ready to restage the Battle of Trafalgar."" Supermarket bosses on the island today warned their shelves will be empty by Saturday unless the Royal Navy can stop French trawlers blockading the port. Stocks of bread, fruit, fresh meat and vegetables will be gone if freight ships cannot deliver their crucial daily supplies, CEO of Jersey Co-op Mark Cox said. Mr Cox said the island is relying on the Royal Navy ships HMS Severn and HMS Tamar to make sure the French boats back off. The last freight ship, Commodore Goodwill, arrived in Jersey at 4.30am and there is another scheduled for tonight, but supermarket chiefs fear it may not get through. Mr Cox told The Sun: ""The port is a lifeline to the island and it is absolutely critical that the freight vessels can get into the port. ""It's vital that those routes are kept clear, the shelves will be bare within two days if the port is blocked. ""At this stage we are reliant on the Royal Navy to keep the freight ships coming into the island on a daily basis."" It's vital that those routes are kept clear, the shelves will be bare within two days if the port is blocked."" HMS Severn, which has previously been used to shadow Russian navy warships, arrived near Jersey in the early hours of this morning. HMS Tamar joined shortly after. Following crisis talks with the island's leadership, Downing Street said: ""The Prime Minister underlined his unwavering support for Jersey. ""He said that any blockade would be completely unjustified. As a precautionary measure the UK will be sending two Offshore Patrol Vessels to monitor the situation. ""They agreed the UK and Jersey Governments would continue to work closely on this issue."" The Royal Navy ships were first deployed soon after the UK finally departed the EU at the beginning of the year - again to ward off French trawlers. Fishing was a major sticking point during last year's Brexit negotiations - and has now flared up once again. Under the deal European trawlers can continue catching in UK waters for some years to come. But those casting their nets off Jersey must obtain a licence by proving they have a history of operating in these waters. Last Friday the Jersey Government handed 41 of these permits to French boats that rely on the rich waters surrounding the British dependency. Yet French authorities complained these licences came with ""new technical measures"" that have hamstrung their fishermen with last-minute red tape. Jersey's demands include French boats be equipped with tracking devices, as well as making them fill out more paperwork. Emmanuel Macron's maritime minister stoked tensions by threatening to cut off the power supply to Jersey in retaliation. And frustrations came to a boil when a fleet of French boats steamed to the port of St Hellier threatening a blockade. After France warned it would be ""brutal and difficult"" unless their boats got better access, Britain branded the comments ""surprising and disappointing, especially from a close neighbour."" A government spokesman added: ""To threaten Jersey like this is clearly unacceptable and disproportionate. It would be an act of war ""This is just the latest example of the EU issuing threats as a first resort at any sign of difficulty."" As tensions mounted, Boris Johnson was urged to send in Navy observers by the boss of the Commons Defence Committee. Tobias Ellwood slammed France's ""shameful behaviour"" and pleaded for calm. The ex-defence minister added: ""It would be wise to dispatch a Royal Navy Off Shore Patrol Vessel to the area to observe and report."" St Helier is Jersey's only port, which is narrow and would only take a handful of 150-ton French trawlers to block. But local fisherman Steve Viney, 55, told The Sun: ""It would be an act of war, it would be amazing to see the French try but I think they would be disappointed when they arrived and realised we won't stand for it. ""The fact that the EU is threatening an island is off the scale, they like to think they are civilised but clearly that's not true because this is something that Russia or China might do."" Murray Norton, chief executive of Jersey Chamber of Commerce, said the French have been heavy handed in their threats. Mr Norton said: ""The French threats are disproportionate considering we are talking about only a handful of fishing licences which are in dispute. Jersey's External Affairs Minister, Ian Gorst, said the French have made clear their ""frustration"" over the new Brexit trade deal. He told BBC News: ""There is some frustration in France, and they've made it clear to us, around the terms of the new trade deal. ""But we are in a new era of relationship with the European Union. That is governed by the Brexit trade deal and we believe that it can serve our interest as well as the interests of French fishermen into the future. ""We cannot look back to the previous arrangements. They have gone. We must make the new trade deal work in all of our interests."" After the protests came to and end, Jersey's Chief Minister, Senator John Le Fondré sounded a conciliatory note saying the government had listened to what the fishermen had to say. ""The French fishermen protested peacefully and respectfully, and were able to set out their concerns directly to Government representatives,"" he said. ""Speaking directly to the fishermen has enabled both parties to better understand how those challenges will be addressed."" No10 said France should lodge a complaint using the dispute mechanism set up in last year's Brexit deal if it has a problem rather than immediately making threats. A UK Government spokesman said:  ""We are working closely with the EU and Jersey on fisheries access provisions following the end of the Transition Period, so trust the French will use the mechanisms of our new treaty to solve problems.""

250,250,The Sun,Harry ColeJonathan Reilly,European countries set to make travel green list revealed – and those missing out,"SUNSEEKERS looking for a European break this month can head to Gibraltar or Malta, The Sun can reveal. The two tiny Mediterranean sunspots are set to be included on the green list for quarantine-free travel after 17 May - due to be announced this Friday. A handful of countries will be given coveted green status in a new travel traffic light system based on jab roll out and Covid rates - meaning Brits can visit with just two tests on their return. Portugal may also get the nod, but holiday favourites Spain and Greece will have to likely wait until a review in June, sources say. They are likely to be on the ""amber list"" meaning people can visit but they will have to quarantine for ten days when they return to the UK. But insiders think most top destinations including France will be given the green travel go ahead by the school summer holidays in July. Medics led by top doc Jonathan Van Tam will present country data to ministers today as they meet to approve the first tranche of green and amber countries. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is due to unveil the full list on Friday - with travel industry bosses braced for a flurry of bookings this weekend. The Rock has jabbed its entire adult population and the little British oversees territory on the Southern tip of Spain has lifted most restrictions and returned to normality. Last night Gibraltar's Chief Minister delighted in the news - telling Brits: ""Gibraltar is THE safest place in Europe. 100 per cent Covid free."" Rock boss Fabian Picardo told The Sun: ""Thanks to Great Britain, all adults are already vaccinated. We will NOT require UK residents to have a test to enter Gibraltar. ""Gibraltar is your great, British, staycation in the Mediterranean. Come enjoy the last British part of the European continent."" Masks are only worn inside shops on the Rock and social distancing has been lifted. Meanwhile half-a-million-strong Malta is the leading the way amongst EU countries for vaccines. The Commonwealth island nestled between Italy and Tunisia has given 34 per cent of its population two doses and suffers just a handful of new Covid cases each day. Meanwhile the Foreign Office has begun downgrading strict travel for other European countries, giving hope they too will soon be given the green light for travel. Government no longer advises against travel to the Spanish Canary Islands, and the Greek Islands of Rhodes, Kos, Zante, Corfu and Crete. However Britain's borders remain shut for another 11 days and Whitehall insiders said the popular holiday islands were unlikely to make the green list just yet. One said: ""The changes are not necessarily an indication of what will be on the green list this week - but it is a recognition that Covid cases are lower in those areas. ""But they will certainly go amber, and if current trajectories continue, they will go green in time for the summer rush."" The Sun yesterday revealed Portugal is also on the ""cusp"" of making the list. Green countries will have to have similar Covid rates as Britain - currently around 25 per 100,000 - no new variants and testing sequencing to spot vaccine busting strains. They will also need to have vaccinated around 40 per cent of their population. While Portugal meets the first three criteria, it has only vaccinated around 20 per cent of its people. Yesterday senior cabinet minister Liz Truss urged Brits to hold off booking trips until the end of the week. She said: ""We won't have much longer to wait to get the full announcement from the transport secretary. ""I would suggest that people wait for that announcement. Of course we're doing all we can to make sure that we follow our road map, that we open up the economy and travel gradually."""
251,251,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Britain’s borders to reopen for international travel to ‘handful’ of countries in 16 days,"BRITAIN'S borders will be reopened for international travel in 16 days, with ""a handful"" of approved countries published as soon as Tuesday. Boris Johnson and his medics are ""confident"" the Covid case data means they can push ahead for the 17 May unlocking milestone that will see a slow return to travel for leisure. A traffic light system of risk will see the world carved up into green, amber or red zones based on vaccine roll-out and case rates, as well as new variants found. But insiders warn only a ""handful"" of countries will be approved for ""green"" quarantine free travel in the first tranche due to be published next week. Gibraltar, Malta and Portugal are early contenders for the coveted status, but holiday favourites France, Spain, Greece and Italy are still some weeks away from being approved and heading for ""amber"" status. Green zones will mean quarantine free travel but tests before and after entry. Travellers from amber list countries will have to quarantine at home for 10 days on arrival. Entry from red list countries will be outlawed still, with anyone coming through those countries forced to pay to be isolated in a hotel when they arrive at their own cost. But ministers are under growing pressure to speed up publication of which countries will be in which zone. Last night the boss of the powerful Commons Transport Committee blasted: ""Incredibly, passengers and industry are still in the dark about which countries they can visit and the requirements to do so."" Tory Huw Merriman added that details this weekend would be ""the bare minimum of planning that the industry and consumers need to begin any sort of preparations for a restart of international travel on 17 May"". He added: ""Instead, uncertainty has been prolonged. This uncertainty could cost people their jobs."" And he warned: ""The Government is in danger of squandering the opportunity to take advantage of the UK's world-leading 'vaccine dividend' as countries across the globe begin to open up for international travel."""
252,252,The Sun,Natasha ClarkHarry Cole,Hugging set to get green light from ministers in just two weeks’ time,"MINISTERS are set to green light hugs with family in just two weeks' time, The Sun can reveal. Boris Johnson kept touching rules in limbo in his lockdown lifting roadmap - keeping advice on social distancing and close contact between people who know each other subject to review. But with our zooming vaccine rollout and dropping case numbers, Whitehall sources say that milestone will likely be hit on 17 May - bringing joy to millions of Brits. Ahead of step three of the lockdown roadmap, ministers will meet next week to sign off relaxing the rules around social distancing. It's expected that people will be told they can finally hug their close friends and family again - but social distancing rules will be expected to stay for others. Brits will be told they can decide on their own levels of risk ""for their own circumstances"" and take decisions into their own hands after months of advice from ministers about what to do. One Whitehall source told The Sun: ""The modelling is on track for step three as planned."" May 17 will see the rule of six relaxed outdoors and people in England finally able to see friends and family indoors again, but in small numbers. Ministers will take a decision on whether to relax all social distancing rules ahead of step 4 of the roadmap, which will come in June. But there are fears they could stay for months to come to keep infection rates at bay. Several pilots are currently underway across the UK, some of which have trialled scrapping social distancing and other rules to monitor how to open events safely. The results of those trials will land on ministers' desks in the next week. The smashing news comes as the UK approaches nearly 50million doses of vaccines dished out to Brits across the country. And nearly 15million second doses have been achieved - meaning the most vulnerable people in the country will shortly all have had their first jab."
253,253,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Boris Johnson’s aides are warned they face JAIL if they delete texts or emails about his Downing St flat renovation,"BORIS Johnson's aides have been warned they face jail if they delete texts or emails about the ""cash for curtains"" row - and have a week to turn over their phones. A stark email sent to Conservative Party staff states: ""You are put on notice that this is a criminal investigation."" The Electoral Commission announced it was launching an official probe this week following accusations the PM did not foot the upfront cost of the rumoured £200,000 refit of the Downing Street flat. The warning shot to staff reads: ""If you knowingly falsify, conceal, destroy or otherwise dispose of information… you could be committing a criminal offence of Perverting the Course of Justice."" The Electoral Commission is investigating the party over an alleged breach of funding rules relating to the revamp of the No11 flat the PM shares with his fiancée Carrie Symonds. Mr Johnson insists he has personally paid for the lavish refurb and rubbished claims of wrongdoing as a ""farrago of nonsense"". But he has not denied reports that the bill was initially covered by a party or private donation, which under strict rules must be declared. All Tory staffers have now been given a week to trawl their devices for any messages or emails concerning the refit. An legal warning email sent to employees at Conservative Campaign Headquarters yesterday said: ""By Friday 7 May, you are required to produce un-redacted copies of all communications… which concern any arrangements and/or agreements made for the settlement of costs arising from the refurbishment works at the 11 Downing Street flat beyond those met by the Cabinet office from public funds"". The ultimatum issued by legal officer Alan Mabbutt added: ""You are put on notice that this is a criminal investigation."" The watchdog announced it was launching an official probe this week following accusations the PM did not foot the upfront cost. Prime ministers have a £30,000 annual budget to do up the Downing Street flat, but the decor redesign in No11 reportedly spiralled to six figures. Mr Johnson and ministers have swatted away questions of who initially paid for the renovation. During a fiery exchange with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer this week, the PM would not be drawn on whether the Conservative Party or Tory peer Lord Brownlow of Sherlock Row stumped up the original funding. He said: ""I have covered the costs… I conformed in full with the code of conduct and officials have kept advising me through this whole thing."" The watchdog, which has sweeping powers to impose fines or refer cases to the police, said there were ""reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence or offences may have occurred"". Separate probes into the renovation row are also being carried out by top civil servant Simon Case and No10's new No10 standards adviser Lord Geidt. The PM has also been reported to the Commons authorities."

The FA, Premier League, EFL and the women's game will turn off Twitter, Facebook and Instagram for four days. They are calling on social media firms to stem the ""relentless"" flow of abuse. In an act of unity, The Sun will stop posting on our Twitter accounts from 3pm today until 11.59pm on Monday. France's Thierry Henry, who has led the charge for big tech reform, was ""thrilled"" by the show of strength. He said: ""It is a powerful statement."" Writing in today's Sun, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden warns social media giants to act or face the consequences. Under his Online Safety Bill, companies could be shut down if they fail to remove abuse. He writes: ""Under the legislation, if social media companies fail to keep their promises to users - if they don't quickly remove racist abuse, for example - they will face severe sanctions. ""For the very worst failures, they could have their sites blocked. ""They could also face huge fines of up to ten percent of annual global turnover. ""For a company like Facebook or YouTube, that could be billions."" He continues: ""English football coming off social media is a powerful statement. ""Everything that tries to destroy the beauty and the happiness of our game — we should fight it. ""This is my happiest moment. Football stands for something. Not only money."""
255,255,The Sun,Harry ColeDaniel Jones,Pubs & shops are primed for £4billion bank holiday weekend – as England on track for total reopening in June,"PUBS and shops are primed for a £4billion Wonder Weekend — with jabbed-up England on course to be unlocked entirely by June. The first Bank Holiday weekend that most boozers have been open since last August could see 20 million pints being drunk to celebrate success with the vaccine rollout. Jabs Minister Nadhim Zahawi said indoor mixing will be on next month while Covid proof arrangements will be ready for travelling Brits. And the last two phases of lockdown should be lifting on time with him insisting: ""The good news is May 17 looks good, June 21 looks good, too."" Mr Zahawi's optimism comes as virus rates dropped below 50 cases per 100,000 people in more than 95 per cent of UK areas. Six people will be able to meet indoors in May with the last sectors of the economy, such as nightclubs, able to reopen five weeks later. The Rule of Six is also due to be lifted outdoors, allowing groups of up to 30 to mix in summer sunshine. Mr Zahawi confirmed people will not need to present Covid papers, proving they have been jabbed or tested, when pubs and restaurants fully reopen. He said: ""Vaccinations are working — about 70 per cent of the adult population of England have antibodies, almost two-thirds have had a single dose, a quarter have had two doses."" And he added: ""For travel overseas, clearly a number of countries are indicating they will need Covid certification. ""It is right to make the certification available for our citizens and to shape the protocols around the world. ""Because clearly a number of countries are going to do this, we would rather do it in a co-ordinated way."" And despite fears the NHS App for travelling abroad will not be ready, Mr Zahawi insisted it would be available from May 17. That will sweeten even more the drink for five million Brits this weekend, who will start the marathon booze-up tonight. But bars told punters to BYOB — that is 'bring your own blankets', not beer — with chilly 57F (14C) days and 46F evenings forecast for beer gardens. High streets saw a welcome rush for coats, helping them shift lockdown's unsold winter stock. Police and Covid marshals will step up patrols in the wake of wild scenes outside some bars following the April 12 re-openings. Some 50,000 pubs and restaurants are serving booze — though that is under half of hospitality venues. A British Beer & Pub Association spokesperson said: ""Pubgoers will be looking forward to their first Bank Holiday weekend back, particularly after not being able to go there at Easter — and many were closed at Christmas."" Even rain should not bother most as many pubs have tents or roofs on terraces. Around £350million will be spent in pubs and restaurants over the weekend, with more than £3.5billion in shops, shows a VoucherCodes. co. uk study. Meanwhile, all over-40s are now eligible for their Covid jab after health bosses expanded the scheme to a million more adults. But those in their 30s have been told they will have to wait until May 10 for their initial shot due to a vaccine supply bottleneck. Officials have yet to decide on whether the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine should be limited to over-40s. Current advice is for under-30s to get alternative jabs if available due to a risk of rare blood clots. But the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation is now considering raising the age limit. NHS England will start texting adults aged 40 and 41 inviting them for their first jab from today. NHS boss Sir Simon Stevens said nine in ten of all over-45s have now been vaccinated. Infection levels in all regions of England have either fallen slightly or remain unchanged, according to Public Health England."
256,256,The Sun,Harry ColeKate Ferguson,No10 fear axed aide Cummings will publish texts exposing chaos at the heart of Government’s Covid battle,"DOWNING Street bigwigs are quaking in terror that Dominic Cummings will publish explosive WhatsApp group texts exposing chaos at the heart of No10's Covid battle. A string of senior aides fear the ""sword of Dom-ocles"" - that the axed aide will reveal their tell-all messages if they criticise him too much. Boris Johnson is at war with his one time trusted adviser over a series of sensational leaks which have plunged his premiership into days of chaos. The PM reckons Cummings is behind stories revealing he spent a whopping £58,000 on a swanky makeover of his Downing Street flat. Last night No10 appeared to admit for the first time that Mr Johnson has maxed out the £30,000 every PM gets each year to keep the flat in good nick - and then spent even more. Boris is understood to have then gone cap in hand to rich Tory donors for a loan to meet the costs. In another day of claim and counter claim, it emerged that: Key Johnson ally Therese Coffey savages Dominic Cummings - telling the public to remember the Barnard Castle eye test furore before believing the rogue aide. Labour accused Mr Johnson of lying over sick Covid body count gag. Ministers face court action over using Signal and Whatsapp to potentially avoid Freedom of Information Act. One Whitehall insider said: ""Everyone is worried about going to hard on Dom in case he drags them in too. ""There are some very senior people scrolling back through their phones wondering if they are in trouble."" Mr Johnson is facing a growing pressure to go public with the costs of a plush makeover of his Downing Street digs. The PM – whose bank balance is stretched after a costly divorce – is said to have been loaned tens of thousands of pounds from the Tories to cover the makeover. He has so far refused to lodge details of the loan in strict Commons anti-sleaze registers. Rules state MPs have 28 days to declare any benefit - or face a suspension from duties. Instead Mr Johnson plans only to give details to an annual round up of Ministers interests - a rulebook of which PM is the final judge over whether anyone is in breach Top constitutional boffin Dr Hannah White, from the Institute for Government, said it was highly ""unusual"" for the PM to be caught up in such a 'cash for wallpaper' scandal. She said: ""I can't think of any example of a political party lending money for personal use."" Former Whitehall boss Lord Gus O'Donnell said Bojo is already ""very late"" in declaring the cash. He fumed: ""Prime Ministers have to set an example and, therefore, they should abide by the rules. I think that's really important."" A No 10 spokeswoman said: ""Any costs of wider refurbishment this year beyond those provided for by the annual allowance have been met by the Prime Minister personally. ""Conservative Party funds are not being used for this."" Yesterday campaigners served ministers with 14 days notice to come clean about how they use messaging apps or be served with a High Court challenge. Cori Crider, Director of campaign group Foxglove, said: ""It seems like every lobbyist and would-be crony under the sun has sussed how this government really runs: by instant message. ""That's a recipe for cover-ups - and it's unlawful. The texting scandals we're reading about now could be the tip of the iceberg."""
257,257,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor","Dominic Cummings NOT cleared from leaking lockdown secrets, top civil servant says – and culprit may NEVER be found","DOMINIC Cummings' boast to have been cleared from leaking lockdown secrets was not backed up by Britain's top civil servant - and spies hunting the ""chatty rat"" may never get their man. Cabinet Secretary Simon Case also tore up Cummings' incendiary blog claims Boris had suppressed a probe into last year's leak to protect a pal of his fiancee Carrie Symonds. Hauled before MPs to explain why no one has been caught five months after the planned November lockdown was leaked early, the newbie mandarin insisted that one had yet been found guilty or cleared. But the head of the civil service was forced to admit the ""source or sources"" may never be found, despite top secret intelligence agency work trying to track them down for months. However Case all but confirmed the security services had been brought into probe the leak, but he admitted no criminal activity or breach of the Official Secrets Act had taken place. However he hinted the methods used to try to snare the 'Chatty Rat' were top secret spy craft, telling MPs he was ""under restraints related to classification."" Case infuriated the MPs during a sometimes painful evidence session, hiding behind classified secrets and ongoing investigations to avoid giving straight answers. The youngest ever Whitehall boss, 42, was compared to a ""badly scripted version"" of hit BBC satire ""Yes, Minister"" after the 130 minute sleaze roasting. Sacked Downing Street aide Mr Cummings claimed in his incendiary ""Nuclear Dom"" blogpost last week that Mr Case had told him last year that he was not a suspect for the leak. But speaking before the Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee Mr Case declined to back up that version of events. Mr Cummings also accused Mr Johnson of wanting to shelve the probe as one of the suspects was Henry Newman, an aide who is a close pal of Ms Symonds. But Mr Case insisted ""at no point has this investigation been in any way de-prioritised, it is in the hands of professional investigators who have a range of tools and techniques at their disposal"". Asked if he accepted what was said in Mr Cummings' blog, Mr Case would only say: ""I am constrained in what I can say because it's in the context of an ongoing investigation."" Probed by Tory MP David Jones if he had authorised Downing Street to tell the media that neither Mr Cummings nor then communications director Lee Cain were the leakers, Mr Case said: ""I am not trying to frustrate, but this is drawing me into details of an ongoing investigation which - for reasons I have set out - I can't go into in this setting."" He said Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle was being updated on the investigation in secret, under Privy Council terms. Committee chairman William Wragg suggested that ""relatively few"" people would have known the information leaked in October ""so it's a rather small pool in which to fish"" in order to find the culprit behind the leak of the lockdown. Mr Case said: ""I'm not trying to frustrate you or other members of the committee on this but we are going here into the details of the investigation and who knew what and this is an area where I am constrained because if I go further on this it will start to reveal the details of the investigation."" But angry MPs on the Committee accused Case of stonewalling, comparing it to satire. Labour's John McDonnell said: ""I don't want to be rude Mr Case but this is coming across as a badly scripted version of 'Yes, Minister'."" And Tory Mr Wragg hit out: ""Mr Case you have known you are coming to this committee for a number of weeks now and there are a number of topical issues… I am surprised you have not been better furnished with the answers to give to the committee."""
258,258,The Sun,Harry Cole,Dominic Cummings blasts ‘incompetent’ Boris Johnson for ‘possibly illegal acts’ in bombshell revenge for leak claims,"DOMINIC Cummings has accused ""incompetent""  Boris Johnson of committing ""possibly illegal"" acts, in a nuclear bomb dropped on Downing Street. No10 had been braced retaliation after they accused the ""bitter"" former aide of leaking embarrassing texts from the Mr Johnson's personal phone. But the Brexit architect stunned Westminster with an incendiary blast branding Mr Johnson's behaviour as ""unethical, foolish, possibly illegal"". Denying some of the accusations levelled against him, Mr Cummings claimed: ""It is sad to see the PM and his office fall so far below the standards of competence and integrity the country deserves."" In a lengthy blog posting he also claimed the Prime Minister had tried to stop an inquiry into the leak last year of plans for a second lockdown because it implicated a friend of his fiancée, Carrie Symonds. He said that he had also warned Mr Johnson against plans to have donors secretly pay for refurbishment of his Downing Street flat, saying they were ""unethical, foolish and possibly illegal"". Yesterday The Cabinet Office confirmed Mr Johnson had met the cost of refurbishments made to the flat himself. However it had been revealed that originally Tory donors had been approached the secure funds. The astonishing row follows Mr Cummings' dramatic departure from No 10 last year amid the fallout from a bitter power struggle with Ms Symonds. All-out war erupted between the Brexit architects after the livid Prime Minister sensationally pointed the finger at his ex-aide for a string of private text messages handed to the BBC. Insiders say Mr Johnson was ""deeply disappointed and saddened"" over his ""suspicion"" that his former senior adviser made public text messages he had sent to a billionaire business chief and the controversial leader of Saudi Arabia in a bid to damage him. All of the leaked messages were received or sent by Mr Johnson during Mr Cummings time in Downing Street, with the PM understood to often share messages with his inner circle. But yesterday Mr Cummings hit back at the claims, denying he had possession of the Dyson texts. He made no mention of the communication with Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman in the fiery statement. His blog post claimed Mr Johnson had ""stopped speaking"" to him about renovations to the Downing Street flat last year. He went on ""I told him I thought his plans to have donors secretly pay for the renovation were unethical, foolish, possibly illegal and almost certainly broke the rules on proper disclosure of political donations if conducted in the way he intended"". ""I refused to help him organise these payments. My knowledge about them is therefore limited,"" Cummings added. ""I would be happy to tell the Cabinet Secretary or Electoral Commission what I know concerning this matter. Last night Mr Johnson told reporters on a campaign stop to Hartlepool, he was ""mystified"" as to why some people have ""chosen to attack"" his communications with Dyson who was trying to help build ventilators. ""I think people aren't so much interested in who is leaking what to whom as the substance of the issue at hand. ""The issue is really the question of the ventilators as you will remember James Dyson was offering to make. Let's be absolutely clear I think it was right to talk to him."" Last night Downing Street said: ""The PM has never interfered in a government leak inquiry."" And on the flat claims, the spokesman added: ""At all times, the Government and Ministers have acted in accordance with the appropriate codes of conduct and electoral law."""
259,259,The Sun,Harry Cole,England could host an extra Euro 2020 game as Ireland is hit by Covid,"ENGLAND is set to be invited to host another European Championship fixture because of Ireland's high Covid rates, The Sun can reveal. Hopes are soaring that the Euros Round of 16 match due to be played in Dublin's Aviva Stadium on 29 June will be moved to Wembley. It would mean that if England win their group stage they would play the first knockout round match at the home of football. Wembley is already due to host the semis and final of the tournament that was meant to be played across 12 Euro 2021 host cities. In March Boris Johnson offered to host more games thanks to lower Covid rates in the UK - and negotiations have been ongoing with UEFA ever since. Talks were ongoing last night but ministers are hopeful of a breakthrough as soon as today. One source said: ""The PM won huge support with UEFA this week in his tough stand on the Super League."""
260,260,The Sun,Harry ColeJonathan Reilly,"Covid vaccine passport app won’t be ready for end of lockdown, ministers warn","THE new Covid vaccine passport app will not be ready for the end of lockdown, Cabinet ministers warned last night. Holidaymakers will be given jab certificates this summer but a new NHS app for stadiums and festivals is still ""months away"" from being ready. Whitehall tech bosses are converting the NHS app to store data about jabs, tests and antibodies - but it is far from ready. And they said that it certainly wouldn't be ready before Boris Johnson has vowed to lift restrictions fully at the end of June. Senior sources say hopes of the app being used in time for Wembley hosting the Euros final have faded, with paper or text message proof of testing likely to be used instead. One Cabinet source said: ""NHSX who are behind it, are in a total mess and it is inevitably going to be late."" But last night health sources insisted there were no concerns about the potential to deliver the app in time for the summer season. The PM is said to want to launch vaccine certification systems for international travel in line with letting Brits go on holiday from May 17. But any sort of papers for big events won't be able to use them until the tech is sorted. The PM said earlier this week: ""under the current system, you don't need any kind of certificate, you certainly won't need anything on the May 17 openings, assuming we get there."" Meanwhile, it emerged yesterday that top summer hotspots could be on the UK's green list when holidays become legal again next month. Island destinations are thought to be highly likely to make the cut after Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said they would be given their own places in the traffic light classification earlier this week - mirroring the last year's travel corridors. Spain's Canary Islands, Portugal's Azores and Malta may make the list due to their high vaccination rates and low cases of the virus. Greece is also ramping up a campaign to get all of it's islanders jabbed up first. And Fernando Valdés, Spanish Tourism Secretary, said yesterday (THURS) that he wanted to ""restart holidays"" in six weeks. He said: ""We are desperate to welcome you this summer. We've been having constant conversations with UK authorities."" The traffic light system for assessing countries as ""green"", ""amber"" or ""red"" is based on vaccination rates, infection levels, whether there are variants of concern and how good their genomic scanning system is. Holidaymakers will be able to travel to ""green"" destinations without having to quarantine on their return, although they will have to pay for a gold standard PCR test on their return. ""Amber"" nations - which is expected to include most of mainland Europe - will require travellers to quarantine at home for 10 days on their return and pay for two PCR tests on days two and eight. Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy The PC Agency, and said he expected up to 30 countries to be considered ""green"" safe destinations. He said: ""Countries that will possibly be green include Israel, Barbados, Morocco, Maldives, Seychelles, Grenada, St Lucia, Antigua and the British Overseas Territories of Bermuda, Turks & Caicos, Falkland Islands, St Helena and a clutch of others. ""As such, it's highly likely 20-30 countries could be green from the outset."""
261,261,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson accuses ‘Chatty Rat’ Dominic Cummings of leaking text messages to try to destabilise him,"RAGING Boris Johnson has accused his former right-hand man Dominic Cummings of trying to destabilise him with vengeful leaks. Insiders say the PM is ""deeply disappointed and saddened"" that texts he sent were made public. His advisor was forced out of No10 last November. The PM has ordered his staff to cease all contact with his former ally. The man who once pulled the strings in Government as an all-powerful advisor is now suspected of ""treachery"" against the Prime Minister and of being the 'Chatty Rat' behind a series of leaks. Mr Johnson has told allies that Downing Street's soaring poll lead and the success of the vaccine roll-out may have enraged him further. A political row has ignited after text messages sent by Mr Johnson to billionaire business chief James Dyson and a Saudi prince were made public. Whitehall security chiefs launched a formal investigation into the ""damaging"" leaks. But Mr Johnson has only one suspect — and is ""deeply disappointed"" by his attempts to ""undermine"" the Government. A No10 source said: ""The Prime Minister thinks Dominic Cummings is responsible for a series of damaging leaks about his personal communications. ""He is deeply disappointed and saddened by what he thinks his former adviser has been doing and believes he is attempting to undermine the Government and the Conservative Party. ""He fears Dom was responsible for the text message leaks about James Dyson and Mohammed bin Salman."" All of the leaked messages were received or sent by Mr Johnson during Mr Cummings' time at No10, with the PM understood to often share them with his inner circle. Mr Cummings left No10 last November and the top insider added: ""There is a worry that he is bitter about how the government has moved onwards and upwards since his departure."" Downing Street was rocked this week after the BBC revealed texts the PM had sent billionaire Brexit backer Sir James at the height of last year's first Covid wave. Mr Johnson had promised him he would not be slapped with extra taxes if he sent staff to the UK to help build ventilators. The row dominated PMQs on Wednesday, with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accusing the PM of doing favours for those who have his personal mobile number. Sir James, now based in Singapore, had texted the PM last March to say he is ""ready"" to help in the fight against Covid. But he asked for reassurance his staff would not be walloped by a stinging tax bill if they travelled to the UK. The PM replied: ""James, I am first lord of the Treasury and you take it that we are backing you to do what you need."" It came after days of lurid claims of lobbying, sparked by former Tory MP David Cameron's unsuccessful bid to get Treasury loans for toxic firm Greensill Capital. Sir Keir blasted: ""What this shows once again is the extent of the sleaze and the cronyism that is at the heart of his Conservative government."" No10 had initially said there would not be a probe into how the exchange was made public. But a change of course emerged yesterday, when it was announced that an internal inquiry will be led by the Cabinet Office. Downing Street has said it will officially publish correspondence between Mr Johnson and Sir James ""shortly"". The PM also told the Commons he was ""happy to share all the details"" of the exchanges. It came just two weeks after another leak of text messages from Mr Johnson's personal phone appeared in the media. They showed Saudi Arabia's controversial Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had urged the PM to ""correct"" the Premier League's decision to block his £300million Newcastle United takeover bid. Messages revealed Mr Johnson then asked another senior aide to investigate the matter in July 2020. Last night, Mr Cummings did not respond to the incendiary accusation that he had leaked the texts. He and Mr Johnson were once the closest of allies — winning the historic 2016 Brexit vote together, taking over the party and crushing Labour in the 2019 election. However their relationship turned sour after Mr Cummings' infamous lockdown-breaking trip to Durham's Barnard Castle in April 2020. A toxic Downing Street turf war then erupted last November that pitted Mr Cummings against Mr Johnson's fiance Carrie Symonds. The Brexit hardliner was eventually forced out and has been lying low ever since, occasionally tweeting his thoughts on the government. Critics said the string of leaks - especially between foreign leaders and No10 - could pose a risk to national security. Security think-tank the Henry Jackson Society called for urgent action against the leaker. Boss Alan Mendoza hit out: ""This string of leaked private messages from the PM's phone could constitute a national security risk. ""The government needs to urgently investigate who is obtaining them and for what purpose they're leaking them."" Senior MPs also hit out at the security around Mr Johnson's phone, as he has had the same number for more than a decade. Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said the Dyson revelations ""beg the question, what is happening to government security""? He demanded a security review of all ministers' phones. He said: ""There definitely now needs to be a proper review of ministerial use of private communication systems. People don't take it seriously."" Yesterday the Prime Minister's official spokesman did not deny reports that Cabinet Secretary Simon Case advised Mr Johnson to change his phone number. Mr Case had been concerned about the ease with which lobbyists and business leaders were able to contact him. The spokesman told reporters: ""We don't get into details of the advice provided between a Cabinet Secretary and a Prime Minister."" Sir James said his company did not benefit from the ventilator project, and ""voluntarily covered the £20 million of development costs"". He added: ""When the Prime Minister rang me to ask Dyson to urgently build ventilators, of course I said yes. We were in the midst of a national emergency and I am hugely proud of Dyson's response - I would do the same again if asked.""

262,262,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Boris Johnson scraps plans for No10 TV briefings despite blowing £2.7 million on a custom built studio,"BORIS Johnson has ditched plans for White House-style TV briefings from No10 - despite spending £2.6 million on custom built studio. The renovations were completed earlier this year but the special high tech room will now only be used by ministers after the expensive u-turn. Mr Johnson had hired ex-ITV News journalist Allegra Stratton as the face of his Washington inspired daily press operation. But last night she was instead appointed his climate change spokesman ahead of November's landmark Cop26 summit in Glasgow. In February The Sun revealed the soaring costs of the new TV renovations next door to the PM's office in 9 Downing Street. Plan for on camera briefings three times a week was quietly iced after Mr Johnson got cold feet on the idea during the recent lockdown. Bitter rows over Ms Stratton's appointment had helped trigger the downfall of Mr Johnson's powerful aide Dominic Cummings and chief spin-doctor Lee Cain in furious Downing Street civil war late last year. Since then the state of the art studio has only been used for a handful of Covid press conferences. The revamped briefing room is modelled on Washington's West Wing but had been criticised as too lavish and expensive. Last night one source told The Sun: ""The daily briefings had always been a recipe for a disaster, it just took a little while for everyone to come round to that."" But Downing Street insiders insisted the new studio would be used regularly by ministers after the success Covid briefings which generated millions of viewers on the airwaves and online. Allegra Stratton said: ""I am delighted to be starting this new role. ""The COP26 climate conference is a unique opportunity to deliver a cleaner, greener world and I'm looking forward to working with the Prime Minister and Alok Sharma to ensure it is a success."""
263,263,The Sun,Jonathan ReillyHarry Cole,Fans could be handed ‘Golden Shares’ to scupper plans for European Super League,"FANS could be handed the power to block teams joining a new league under plans being considered by minsters. Season ticket holders could be handed ""golden shares"" in their clubs so they have a say in ""legacy decisions"" in the wake of England's 'Big Six' clubs splitting off to create a closed shop European Super League. Fans and supporter groups would be able to vote on key decisions, like moving league, stadium or new ownership, without having access to the revenue. And ministers privately say they will be able to implement this because of a ""Brexit bonus"" with the nation no longer in a vice-like grip of the European courts. Government ""golden shares"" were barred by the EU after airport group BAA euro courts ruled they broke laws promoting the single market back in 2003. Whitehall insiders say than now we are free from the shackles of Brussels, there would be nothing to stop government imposing similar schemes on clubs – with fans, rather than government owning the shares. Speaking yesterday, Arsenal Supporters Trust chief Tim Payton said No10 officials in meetings had backed the ""golden share"" idea. He said: ""We've been compulsively forced out by [Arsenal owner] Stan Kroenke - we didn't want to sell, we were the true custodians, we were able to go to the AGM and hold the directors to account and monitor the financial accounts. ""But he forced us out using company law. ""So, what I pushed for was with the with the government support the FA in the legal action against the clubs and in the longer term for a review that included looking at company law and how fans can perhaps, like in Germany own '50 plus one' of their club or will have a golden share ""It was pleasing to get the response that the government would legislate to address competition law."" And the 'Big Six' may be forced to play behind closed doors even after Covid - as the competition watchdog opened probe into their hated breakaway Super League. At crisis talks at Downing Street with the FA and fan groups yesterday the Boris Johnson threatened to hit rebel clubs with a ""legislative bomb"". The Competition and Markets Authority is investigating the nascent European Super League and the Prime Minister ruled ""nothing off the table"" in his vow to strangle the plot on takeoff. As well as windfall taxes and visa restrictions on players, another idea being mooted by ministers would be blocking any club that signs up from having fans in stadiums this year as a punishment for greedy bosses. Following No10 meeting Mr Johnson launched a blistering assault on the billionaire owners of the 'Big Six', turning beloved clubs into the playthings of rich bankers. And the PM publicly warned them his punishment laws will be brought ""to the forefront"" if they did not back down. He added: ""How can it be right that you create a kind of cartel that stops clubs playing against each other without the hope and excitement of fans up and down the country?"" In a stark message to club boardrooms, Mr Johnson urged them to remember ""football was invented and codified in this country, it is one of the great glories of this country's cultural heritage. ""These clubs, these names, originate from famous towns and cities in our country and I don't think it right, that they should be somehow dislocated from their hometowns, home cities, taken and turned into international brands and commodities to just circulate the planet, propelled by the billions of banks, without any reference to fans to fans and to those who who've loved them all their lives."" And he added: ""I don't think it right that we should forget the basic principle of competition, which is so important and gives so much excitement and joy to the sport."" Asked about breaking up ownership of clubs, he added that a root and branch review of the English game would look at German models of fan ownership. Mr Johnson told the FA they had his ""government's full backing to take whatever action necessary to put a stop to these plans."" And the PM vowed to ""uphold the fundamental principle that any club should have the chance to play and win against the biggest players in the game."" Last night Downing Street urged English clubs to walk away from the nascent Super League, saying: ""I think we're fairly unequivocal that we don't want this to go ahead in the current form so we would welcome any club that wants to step back from this approach."" Meanwhile France announced yesterday that it will push for new EU laws to stop the breakaway league in its tracks. Europe minister Clement Beaune said: ""We must exclude this type of closed competition based on money. I hope UEFA will take the strongest measures. ""We will try, even through EU law, to reinforce the financing systems of small clubs and entrench at last this European model of football. ""We need to act much faster than with legislation. I hope that political pressure will be exerted."""
264,264,The Sun,Harry ColeStephen MoyesTom Wells,Football fans protest at Big Six greed as Government vows to punish clubs,"ANGER mounted last night at plans for a European Super League — with the Government threatening to punish clubs that break away. Owners of the Premier League's Big Six joiners were dubbed ""snakes"" by Uefa, while stars may be banned from the Euros and World Cup. Furious fans protested outside the Prem's ""Big Six"" clubs today amid a wave of anger at plans for a European Super League. Current and former players, celebrities, politicians and royalty were also united in revulsion at what was called a ""war on football"". Owners of Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Man City, Man United and Spurs — among the 12 breaking away — were dubbed ""liars and snakes"". A £4.6billion pot would be split among them under the plans while there would be no relegation from the new league. But ministers last night threatened punishment taxes and visa restrictions on the clubs — while Uefa warned players would be banned from international competition. Writing in The Sun today, Boris Johnson promised fans: ""It is your game – and you can rest assured that I'm going to do everything I can to give this ludicrous plan a straight red."" FA President Prince William also voiced his concern at the proposals, adding: ""Now, more than ever, we must protect the entire football community."" The Football Supporters Association said the plans were ""motivated by nothing but cynical greed"". It added: ""This competition is being created behind our backs by billionaire club owners who have zero regard for the game's traditions and continue to treat football as their personal fiefdom."" Fans from the six clubs also joined forces to condemn the proposals. They wrote: ""We are unified in opposition to them and we will continue to do all we can collectively to stop these plans."" Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin warned any players lining up in the closed league would be ""banned from the World Cup and Euros"". He also branded club execs ""liars and snakes"" after undercutting attempts to reform the Champions League. He said: ""This idea is a spit in the face for all football lovers and our society."" Match of the Day host and former Spurs striker Gary Lineker said: ""If fans stand as one against this anti-football pyramid scheme, it can be stopped in its tracks."" Ex-Liverpool defender and Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher was ""ashamed"". He added: ""Liverpool's apparent leading role in threatening football's competitive ideals is a betrayal of a heritage they are seeking to cash in on."" Liverpool were in action last night at Elland Road, where Leeds players warmed up wearing protest shirts. As The Sun said Balls To The Super League, Arsenal legend Ian Wright called the idea ""absolutely shameful"". He added: ""Remember who you are, what you are and what you represent. That's what Arsenal's about."" Ex-Man United defender Rio Ferdinand stormed: ""This is, for me, a war on football."" Former United midfielder Ander Herrera, who now plays for PSG, said the ""rich were stealing what the people created"". The Spaniard added: ""I love football and I cannot remain silent about this."" Current United star Bruno Fernandes agreed online with fellow Portuguese international Daniel Podence that ""dreams can't be buy (sic)"". Football Supporters Association boss Kevin Miles said billionaire owners are desperate to carve out an ever-bigger slice of revenues. He added: ""It would threaten the very existence and the structure of English football we have known and loved for many years. ""Many of them don't understand the culture, and have no sympathy and support for the pyramid of how the game is organised here."" Actor Stephen Fry said of the clubs: ""They have brought together the whole divided nation, indeed all of Europe – everyone united in disgust and revulsion at such greed and stupidity."" The Super League will have 20 sides, each in line for a welcome bonus of more than 200million euros. Organisers are haggling over broadcasting rights. But the PM vowed to look at all options to strangle it, while ministers threatened windfall taxes and even bans on teams entering the UK. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: ""We will put everything on the table to prevent this from happening. We will do whatever it takes. ""We are examining every option, from governance to competition law and mechanisms that allow football to take place."" By Boris Johnson ANYONE who has watched me play football or played with me in the same match will know that I am far from an expert on the beautiful game. But you don't need to be an expert to be horrified at the prospect of the so-called ""Super League"" being cooked up by a small number of clubs. You only need a pulse to know that football is not a brand or a product. In fact, it's so much more than even a sport. Football clubs in every town and city and at every tier of the pyramid have a unique place at the heart of their communities, and are an unrivalled source of passionate local pride. And the joy of the game's current structure, one that has kept people coming back year after year, generation after generation, is that even the most seemingly endless period of frustration is made bearable by the possibility, however remote, that one day you could see them rise up. After all, if Leicester City can win the Premier League, if Nottingham Forest can be champions of Europe, not once but twice, then maybe, just maybe, your team can do the same. But that can only happen if the playing field is even vaguely level and the ability to progress is universal. The European Super League guarantees neither, which is why it has been roundly rejected by the people who matter most: the fans. A year of empty stadiums has reminded us all that football without fans is an altogether more anaemic spectacle. It is your game — and you can rest assured that I'm going to do everything I can to give this ludicrous plan a straight red. Fans on the continent also slammed the proposals as ""illegitimate, irresponsible, and anti-competitive"". Football Supporters Europe said: ""This closed-shop competition will be the final nail in the coffin of European football, forsaking everything that has made it so popular and successful — sporting merit, promotion and relegation, qualification to Uefa competitions via domestic success, and financial solidarity. ""More to the point, it is driven exclusively by greed. The only ones who stand to gain are hedge funds, oligarchs, and a handful of already wealthy clubs, many of which perform poorly in their own domestic leagues despite their inbuilt advantage. Enough is enough."" Man United's US owners, the Glazers, saw the club's share price soar by 8.5 per cent as trading began in New York - with investors backing the idea. But Ian Stirling, of the Man Utd Supporters' Trust, accused them of rubbishing the memory of the Munich air disaster. He said: ""A team died in 1958 to play in Europe, and this is our history being thrown away for money, by owners who know nothing about Manchester. ""Liverpool supporters descended on Anfield to voice their fury. A banner read: ""LFC fans against European Super League."" Another next to it read: ""Shame on you. RIP LFC 1892-2021."" Spion Kop 1906, which organises flag displays there, tweeted: ""We can no longer give our support to a club which puts financial greed above the integrity of the game."""

Harry, 36, was stripped of his three military titles when he quit royal duty with wife Meghan. Royal protocol now means the Duke — who did two tours of Afghanistan with the Blues and Royals — can only wear a suit with medals at royal functions. Harry made the 5,400-mile journey back to the UK on Sunday to make sure he could attend his grandad Philip's funeral. The Duke of Sussex was seen getting off a British Airways flight from Los Angeles that arrived at Heathrow at 1.15pm. Sources had earlier confirmed he was due back imminently to quarantine in time for the Duke of Edinburgh's farewell at St George's Chapel, Windsor, on Saturday. Harry, sixth in line to the throne, was at his £11million Montecito mansion in California when he was told the news of Prince Philip's death on Friday morning. Harry, sixth in line to the throne, was at his £11million Montecito mansion in California when he was told the news of Prince Philip's death on Friday morning. It's the first time Harry has been in the UK since last March — and comes as the Royal Family ordered a truce over the contents of his explosive Oprah Winfrey interview to focus on honouring Prince Philip. This week, Harry paid tribute to his ""witty"" grandfather Philip - remembering the duke as the ""master of the barbecue and legend of banter"". Harry said the Duke of Edinburgh was ""cheeky 'til the end"". The Duke of Sussex, who is currently staying at Frogmore Cottage, said his grandfather had been ""authentically himself"" throughout his more than 70 years of service to the nation."
266,266,The Sun,Britta ZeltmannHarry ColeMatt Wilkinson,Queen’s decision to ban military uniform from Prince Philip’s funeral is significant ‘olive branch to Prince Harry’,"THE Queen's decision to ban military uniform from Prince Philip's funeral is her way of extending an olive branch to Prince Harry, a royal expert has claimed. The Duke of Sussex had faced the humiliating prospect of being the only senior male in the Royal Family wearing civvies after losing his honorary ranks. There was also said to be ""serious Navy displeasure"" at being dragged into a row over Prince Andrew possibly wearing an Admiral's uniform. In order to spare any blushes, the Queen has ordered that no royals wear military uniform for the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral. It comes after Harry, 36, was stripped of his three military titles having quit royal life with wife Meghan. It means the Duke — who did two tours of Afghanistan with the Blues and Royals — can only wear a suit with medals at royal functions. Royal author Phil Dampier told The Sun Online: ""This is all part of an attempt by the Queen to bring the family together and send out an olive branch. ""Because she didn't want Harry to be treated any differently from anyone else because she's anxious for him to heal the rift with his family, with his brother, with his father and to some extent with her really. ""So she's bending over backwards to not put him under any pressure and not embarrass him."" The author of Royally Suited: Harry and Meghan in their own words, added that the Queen was ""ever the pragmatist"" who has ""sought a practical solution to a very delicate situation. He said: ""It was clearly going to be embarrassing for Harry to be the only male royal not wearing a military uniform, especially ironic as he's the only one in recent history who has seen active service. ""The best solution was for no-one to wear uniforms so that there wouldn't have been any embarrassment. I think harry would have felt he was being shown up as being inferior and cut out of the Royal family if he only wore a normal suit and medals."" Covid restrictions mean the Royal Family will be required to wear face masks, while maintaining social distancing at Philip's funeral. And Mr Dampier believes the tough measures would not have helped Harry's embarrassment. ""With face masks meaning we won't be able to read people's expressions, even more emphasis would have been on what [Harry] was wearing and he would have stood out like a sore thumb just wearing a suit,"" he said. ""And probably felt like he was being highlighted and it was being emphasised that he was no longer a working member of the royals."" Insiders involved in planning for Saturday's funeral claim the Queen personally stepped in to suggest all senior male royals wear suits and ties. A military source told The Sun: ""It's the most eloquent solution to the problem."" Another source confirmed last night that ""current thinking is no uniforms"". It followed reports that Prince Andrew told the Queen he wished to dress in Admiral uniform for Prince Philip's funeral - despite deferring the title after the Jeffrey Epstein sex scandal. Prince Andrew, 61, was made an honorary Vice-Admiral in the Royal Navy in 2015. He was due to be promoted to Admiral in 2020 to mark his 60th birthday but chose to defer it until he resumes his official duties. A source close to The Duke said: ""The Duke of York is very keenly aware of Saturday's funeral being a moment for the Duke of Edinburgh, HM and the nation. He has neither wish nor intention to distract from that. ""Speculation on what he may or may not wear is just that, speculation, and no matters of this nature have yet been decided upon. ""The Duke of York will do what is appropriate to the circumstances - he remains stepped back from royal duties."" Andrew is currently benched amid controversy over his links with billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. The Sun revealed Harry flew in from the US on Sunday for the funeral of his grandfather, who died aged 99. Buckingham Palace declined to comment."

268,268,The Sun,Oliver HarveyHarry Cole,Will Greensill lobby scandal turn Heir to Blair into Dodgy Dave?,"WITH Mystic Meg-like foresight, David Cameron once predicted that political lobbying would be ""the next big scandal waiting to happen"". It was 2009 and the then Tory leader hit out at the ""far-too-cosy relationship between politics, government, business and money"", which he said had ""tainted our politics for too long"". Now, the skies above Cameron's shepherd's hut in the Cotswolds are dark with the chickens coming home to roost. Instead of chillaxing with ""his trotters up"" — as EastEnders star Danny Dyer once memorably accused him of doing — Cameron is embroiled in the very scandal he predicted. The ex-Prime Minister stands accused of using his old contacts in government — notably the now Chancellor, Rishi Sunak — to try and get hundreds of millions in taxpayer-funded loans for a company he worked for. Mr Cameron had shares in the financial services firm Greensill Capital that he reportedly hoped could net him a £43million windfall. Accusations of Tory sleaze — the war cry which laid ruin to John Major's administration — have landed in old sparring partner Boris Johnson's lap like an Eton mess. On Monday, the Prime Minister announced a ""thorough"" investigation into Cameron's lobbying. ""The PM isn't pulling his punches on this,"" said a Whitehall insider. ""He doesn't want this kicked into the long grass and wants it done by June."" But yesterday Labour plans for a full parliamentary inquiry were defeated by the Government. Cameron denies he has broken any rules — but will the man once nicknamed the Heir to Blair now be remembered as Dodgy Dave? The Old Etonian's political career came to end in 2016 when he quit Downing Street and his MP role after losing the Brexit referendum that he had called. In 2018, he joined Greensill. He didn't break rules which state ""ministers will be prohibited from lobbying government for two years"". But Cameron's links to the company's boss, Lex Greensill, go much further back. Indeed, the smooth-talking Australian had worked as an unpaid adviser to Cameron when he was Prime Minister. A former sugar cane farmer, Greensill was introduced to Downing Street in 2011 by Jeremy Heywood — then the country's most powerful civil servant. The pair had met at a Wall Street bank. Heywood, who died in 2018, was impressed by Greensill's big idea — using private loans to help pay government suppliers on time. The man from Down Under was even given Downing Street business cards as he helped set up a payment scheme, that was based on his firm's ""supply chain finance"" model. Greensill Capital began providing funding to pharmacies through this scheme in 2018. But Cameron insists he met Greensill ""twice at most in the entirety of my time as Prime Minister"". Fast forward to April last year and, as the pandemic started to take hold and Greensill Capital began to run into financial problems, Cameron got out his contacts book. He texted Chancellor Rishi Sunak asking for emergency funding. A source close to Sunak said Cameron had messaged the Chancellor ""multiple times"". The Chancellor told the former PM he would ""push"" his officials to explore how to help Greensill Capital but insisted there were ""no guarantees"". Cameron also lobbied Treasury ministers Jesse Norman and John Glen. But Cameron's pleas for Treasury loans for Greensill fell on deaf ears. The firm went bust last month putting the jobs of 5,000 British workers at Liberty Steel — backed by Greensill funds — at risk. Since then the scandal has unravelled. It emerged that in 2019, Cameron and Greensill also met Health Secretary Matt Hancock for a ""private drink"" to discuss a new payment scheme for NHS staff. Then this week it was revealed that a top civil servant during Cameron's Downing Street tenure was also working for Greensill. Senior official Bill Crothers spent several months both as government procurement head and adviser to Greensill's board. He later received shares that could have been worth more than £5million. The part-time position was signed off by the Cabinet Office. He would later quit and work full-time for Greensill. Crothers wrote this week: ""I was transparent about the move to Greensill Capital, and it was well known at the time."" A photo has emerged of Mr Cameron and Mr Greensill sipping tea on a desert camping trip to lobby Mohammed bin Salman in early 2020. That's the Saudi Crown Prince whose initials MBS have been used as a nickname — Mr Bone Saw. The trip came just months after MBS is believed to have ordered the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. His murderers used a bone saw to hack him to pieces. The former PM was invited on the trip in his role as a paid adviser and lobbyist for Greensill. At the time, a United Nations report had already found ""credible links"" between the crown prince and the murder of Khashoggi in October 2018. The US later formally accused bin Salman of approving the killing. With the scent of what they believe is sleaze in their nostrils, the Opposition are in full cry. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer quipped of the convoluted scandal in the Commons yesterday: ""Ted Hastings and AC-12 are needed to get to the bottom of this one."" He added: ""The Greensill scandal is just the tip of the iceberg — dodgy contracts, privileged access, jobs for their mates. This is the return of Tory sleaze."" Cameron has denied that he broke any rules or codes of conduct. He said he welcomes the investigation launched by Johnson, his old Eton and Oxford contemporary. The PM — who put paid to Mr Cameron's career by backing the Leave campaign — has vowed investigators would get ""maximum possible access"". A former MP who was close to Cameron said: ""This could have been swerved by No10 but instead Boris has fanned the flames with the inquiry. ""No10 says it's all about transparency, but I think it's partly about Boris needling Dave."" Cameron's usually astute political antennae correctly picked up lobbying's potential for pitfall all those years ago. Now the man who was twice Prime Minister must wait to see if the Greensill probe will tarnish his reputation."
269,269,The Sun,Kate FergusonHarry Cole,Top civil servants given 48 hours to come clean over private sector jobs following Cameron lobbying row,"TOP civil servants have just 48 hours to admit whether they are moonlighting in private sector jobs. Whitehall chiefs face a crackdown amid the fallout from the David Cameron lobbying row. The Prime Minister's top official has written to Civil Service heads of department ordering them to root out those trousering cash from second jobs by Friday evening. After a ""testy"" meeting, Simon Case wrote: ""Serious issues have come to light which are of acute concern for us as the senior leadership team of the Civil Service. ""If you come across any instances of senior civil servants holding remunerated positions or other interests outside government which might conflict with their obligations under the code please bring them to my attention immediately."" Former PM Mr Cameron bombarded Chancellor Rishi Sunak, ministers and aides with messages asking for millions in Covid bailout cash for his employer Greensill Capital, which received nothing and collapsed in March. It also emerged the Cabinet Office allowed ex-top mandarin Bill Crothers to take a role as an adviser at the finance capital firm in September 2015, while Mr Cameron was in No10 And The Sun has learnt that the former Whitehall bigwig believed to have signed off on the move was himself slammed for trying to keep a £100,000-a-year boardroom job while chief exec of the Civil Service. John Manzoni was appointed to the powerful role in October 2014. He spent weeks batting away conflict of interest complaints over his pay from the brewer SABMiller. He eventually waived the cash At Prime Minister's Questions yesterday, Boris Johnson was accused of presiding over the return of Tory sleaze. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, making a joke about TV hit Line of Duty, said: ""Dodgy contracts, privileged access, jobs for their mates, this is the return of Tory sleaze. ""The more I listen to the Prime Minister, the more I think Ted Hastings and AC-12 is needed to get to the bottom of this one."" The Treasury Select Committee has started an independent inquiry after Mr Johnson admitted ""it's not clear those boundaries"" between the Civil Service and business ""have been properly understood"". But a Labour motion for a Parliamentary inquiry was voted down. Tory MP William Wragg said the saga is ""no doubt a tasteless, slapdash and unbecoming episode"". Another, Jackie Doyle-Price, said the damage to Mr Cameron's reputation ""will be with him a very long time""."
270,270,The Sun,Natasha ClarkHarry Cole,Boris Johnson battling alone on world stage to save COP26 climate conference as other countries demand it be delayed,"BORIS Johnson is now battling alone on the world stage to save the COP26 climate conference this year as other countries demand it be delayed. Ministers are reluctant to put the international summit on Zoom instead, meaning a delay for a second year running looks more and more likely. Government sources stressed they want an in-person and ""inclusive"" event to bring world leaders together to fight climate change. But insiders admitted it's up in the air thanks to rising Covid cases around the world. A diplomatic source told The Sun: ""Britain is increasingly isolated on this front. ""No one in Europe thinks it's going to happen and the US are increasingly sceptical it can happen without a delay."" President Biden is hosting a virtual climate summit for Earth Day next week which could pile on more pressure to put it off. Britain has vaccinated over half the adult population so far, but other countries around the world are lagging behind and seeing another wave of the virus. It came as climate warrior Greta Thunburg said this week she would boycott the Glasgow event and called for it to be delayed until global jab rates have risen. She's attended every major climate event since rising to fame over her eco-protests. Downing Street insists no final decisions have been taken on whether to delay the event, which will see people coming from nearly 200 countries around the world. A Government spokesperson said: ""We are working on the basis of COP26 being held in person this November, while closely monitoring the covid situation. ""The summit team is working closely with all partners and exploring what different scenarios might mean for COP26 and how we plan for that, whilst putting the health of the participants and the local community first. ""We are not looking to postpone the summit."" It came as a fresh study said that rich elites must slash their gas-guzzling car emissions, insulate their homes better and fly less to save the planet from being destroyed. UN scientists say the world's wealthiest one per cent produced double the combined carbon emissions of the poorest 50 per cent. Rich frequent flyers who don't have to worry about the cost of heating are to blame and must be persuaded to change their ways, the report from UK-based Cambridge Sustainability Commission on Scaling Behaviour Change said."
271,271,The Sun,Harry Cole,"Pints ordered in pubs will be slapped with calorie counts, leaked ‘nanny-state’ plans reveal","NANNYING health chiefs are to slap calorie counts on pints ordered in pubs, leaked plans seen by The Sun reveal. Matt Hancock's Health department has horrified Cabinet colleagues with orders to force bigger pub chains to reveal the amount of calories in all beer, wine and spirit served in their bars. Menus or even pump labels would have to carry the information. The push would also see all alcohol sold in shops have to publish calorie information and a health warning by law. All pre-packaged booze labels would have warnings about drinking from Professor Chris Whitty, as well as the risks of drink-driving and the amount of calories. The Government's own figures say that there will be a £92 million hit to the already Covid-ravaged booze industry - but ""the benefits to consumers has not been quantified"". Public Health Minister Jo Churchill has told colleagues she wishes to launch a 12-week consultation on the plans. They would force any business with 250 or more people to publish the calorie information about drinks - meaning the change in the law would hit most major pub chains. Churchill points to the fact that 7-8% of drinkers' calorie intake come from booze, with lower socio-economic households and those already overweight benefiting the most from the policy. But last night critics slammed the plans as ""madness"" saying they would be a hammer blow to an already struggling part of the economy. Free market think tank, the Adam Smith Institute, hit out: ""Brits backing their locals are well aware that too many pints makes beer belly more likely. ""We don't need government enforced calorie counts to tell us something we already know."" Boss Matt Kilcoyne added: ""Ministers thinking up this madness should stop and drop the policy. ""Let the publicans and the punters do what they want in the pubs without Mr Hancock wagging his finger each time a pint is pulled."""

The Prime Minister was one of the first who had a trim this morning after a visit from his personal barber at No10 today. He showed off his fresh new look ahead of appearing in the House of Commons to pay tribute to Prince Philip alongside other MPs. He said said today would be a ""huge relief"" for business owners after 99 days of lockdown but urged Brits to ""behave responsibly"". Boris's unruly mop had came under attack last week with critics comparing him to a scarecrow as he addressed the nation moments after the death of Prince Philip was announced. Last night Mr Johnson said: ""Today is a major step forward in our roadmap to freedom as venues such as shops, hairdressers, nail salons, outdoor attractions, and pubs and restaurants open once again. ""I'm sure it will be a huge relief for those business owners who have been closed for so long, and for everyone else it's a chance to get back to doing some of the things we love and have missed."" Today is a major step forward in our roadmap to freedom. But the PM urged the nation to ""behave responsibly"" when pub gardens reopen and restaurants resume outdoor dining in a major easing of England's lockdown. He said: ""I urge everyone to continue to behave responsibly and remember 'hands, face, space and fresh air' to suppress Covid as we push on with our vaccination programme."" Shops deemed non-essential will also threw open their doors once again alongside indoor gyms, swimming pools, nail salons and zoos in another stride back towards normality. However, social mixing indoors will remain heavily restricted, with around 40 per cent of adults yet to receive their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. The fanfare for the easing of restrictions has been muted by the national mourning for the Duke of Edinburgh. Mr Johnson postponed his celebratory pint and Government communications have been pared back to essential messages after Philip's death on Friday."
273,273,The Sun,Harry ColeKate FergusonNatasha Clark,Boris Johnson launches formal probe into David Cameron lobbying after Greensill row,"AN unprecedented formal inquiry into ex-PM David Cameron's lobbying row was launched this morning, The Sun can reveal. Whitehall sleaze busters are probing the former Tory party leader's contact with Government, with details of the independent figure leading the investigation to be outlined later today. Mr Cameron is under fire for sending texts begging Chancellor Rishi Sunak for millions of pounds in Covid bailouts for his new paymasters, Greensill Capital. He is also reported to have been in contact with other Government ministers too after going to work for the firm after leaving No10. Ex-PM Gordon Brown launched a withering public attack on his successor this morning. The former Labour chief has demanded a legal crackdown to slap a five year lobbying ban on ex ministers in the wake of the Greensill lobbying row. The great clunking fist said the dodgy practice of former politicians cashing in on their links to government risks bringing politics ""into disrepute"". His fiery criticism came as Cabinet Office sleazebusters demanded ministers and aides speak up if Dave had been onto them for favours. And Mr Cameron finally broke his silence last night by releasing a groveling 1,200-word statement admitting he should have acted differently - but refusing to apologise. Labour and other critics have demanded an investigation into the ex-PM and how he was able to lobby ministers without it being recorded internally. This morning Mr Brown laid into his predecessor over the ongoing revelations. He told the BBC: ""I can't comment on the individual detail of this but for me there are principles about public service - it cannot ever become a platform for private gain. ""Ministers must never be lobbying, former ministers, prime ministers, must never be lobbying for commercial purposes. Current ministers should not be entertaining such lobbying. ""If we can't succeed in achieving this stopping by the sort of flexibility of the rules, we are going to have to pass laws to make sure that at least for, say, five years, no serving or former prime minister or minister is ever lobbying for any commercial purpose within government. ""It simply brings public service into disrepute."" The Sun has learned that ministers and special advisers across Whitehall are today being asked to declare all contact with the former PM over Greensill. The Cabinet Office propriety team are looking into all reported contact. Last night, Mr Cameron released a lengthy statement in which he accepted he should have communicated with the Government ""through only the most formal of channels"" and admitted that they were ""lessons to be learnt"". He said: ""As a former Prime Minister, I accept that communications with government need to be done through only the most formal of channels, so there can be no room for misinterpretation.""

Ministers and sports chiefs will meet today and agree to allow the event to go ahead. It will likely open with a minute's silence and black armbands for the players.

277,277,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha ClarkChris Pollard,Thousands more pubs will be able to open on April 12 as outdoor boozing and planning rules are eased,"THOUSANDS more pubs will be able to open tomorrow after ministers tore up rules so gazebos and marquees can go up without planning permission. Town halls have also been ordered to let bars and restaurants spill out on to pavements for a booming al-fresco food and booze fest from April 12. Whitehall figures suggest the bonfire of red tape will allow 9,000 additional venues to open rather than having to wait for indoor serving in May. Any venue, even if it is listed, can put up a marquee or structure of any size on their land without planning permission, and keep it up till September. Side panels will need to be open for ventilation, but paperwork is not an issue after ministers ordered councils to back down on threats to cripple the reopening with red tape. In another major boost, venues with pavement access can put out tables and chairs for dining without having to go through the tedious public consultation process that usually takes weeks. They can notify their town hall and carry on serving if they do not hear back in ten days. A new £56million Welcome Back Fund has also been earmarked to help towns and cities get ready to throw open their doors. Councils will be able to apply for cash to hold beer and food festivals in high streets to get people back to shops. Cash will go to town halls to put up more outdoor seating and keep spaces Covid-secure. Flowers can be planted, graffiti scrubbed off and cash plugged into parks to get ready for the big unlocking. The drastic binning of rules was welcomed by the pub industry — itching to get back serving but worried about the April showers. Greg Grundy, boss at The Egremont in Worthing, West Sussex, said the move was great news for landlords and punters. He added: ""Brits love a beer garden, but in April the weather can be a bit dodgy, so marquees and gazebos will become must-have accessories.

""Letting pubs avoid the hassle of planning red tape means it will be green lights all the way to a glorious spring and summer of al-fresco drinking.

It would mark the first time Harry has come face-to-face with his family since he and Meghan sat down with Oprah Winfrey for their explosive interview last month. Asked  if he agreed with Mr Nichols, Sir John said: ""I'm sure he is right, I hope he's right, I believe he is right and I certainly hope so. ""The friction that we are told has arisen is a friction better ended as speedily as possible, and a shared emotion, a shared grief, at the present time because of the death of their father, their grandfather, I think is an ideal opportunity. ""I hope very much that it is possible to mend any rifts that may exist. ""Speaking on Times Radio on Saturday, Mr Nichols had said ""many a family gather and get over tension and broken relationships at the time of a funeral"". ""Something very profound unites them all again. And that would be true for this family, I'm sure,"" he added. ""Obviously the whole ceremony will be watched by everybody, but you think of the complexities of the dynamics in that family and we have to think of Harry, so far away. ""I'm sure he'll come but not being, the whole time, in the public eye might just help. ""Meghan accused some members of the royal family of racism while speaking to Oprah during the bombshell chat and also said the institution failed to help her when she had suicidal thoughts. Harry, who has not returned to the UK since stepping down as a senior royal just over a year ago, told the chat show host he felt let down by his father. He added that he wanted to heal the relationship with the Prince of Wales but ""there's a lot of hurt that's happened"". Harry described his relationship with the Duke of Cambridge as ""space"" but said he loved him and ""time heals all things, hopefully"". The brothers' rift stretches back to before Harry and Meghan's wedding, when Harry was reportedly angered by what he perceived as his brother's ""snobbish"" attitude to Meghan. Following the Oprah interview, the Queen issued a statement saying ""while some recollections may vary"", the issues raised would be taken ""very seriously"" but dealt with privately as a family. Two royal experts also believe that the Duke of Edinburgh's upcoming funeral could offer Harry a chance to heal any rift the interview may have caused. Author Penny Junor says she believes the family will ""pull together"" for the Queen's sake. ""My hope is that if something good can come out of the Duke's death it will be that it brings the family together,"" she told the MailOnline. ""But clearly there is a lot of hurt there on all sides, and I imagine they will all be feeling apprehensive about seeing one another again. ""With luck, their desire to support the Queen and pull together for her sake, which I am sure is what the Duke would have wanted, will win the day."" Royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams has said a ""show of unity"" is vital for repairing relations after the ""very damaging"" remarks made in the Oprah interview. He told the outlet: ""Harry will undoubtedly want to be there and this might start a process which helped to heal the current royal rift. ""His grandfather would undoubtedly welcome it if the monarchy, the institution he spent his life supporting, was strengthened as a result of the start of a reconciliation which began after his death."""
279,279,The Sun,Harry Cole,Brexit Britain is exporting more Easter favourites such as lamb and chocolate eggs than ever,"BREXIT Britain is exporting more Easter faves such as lamb and chocolate eggs than ever. Lamb orders have soared by more than ten per cent this year with West Midlands, Wales and Yorkshire benefiting. Whisky and gin exports from Scotland and London were also up along with British chocolate. Trade boss Liz Truss said: ""The global appetite for our food is huge and growing."" Lamb trade reached a total £436million in 2020 thanks to the Middle East and Japan — where the 23-year ban on the meat was lifted. Tea exports rose five per cent to the US alone. ""As an independent trading nation, the UK is opening new doors for farmers and food producers,"" Ms Truss added. Ministers estimate that exports support 6.5million UK jobs, three-quarters of them outside London. Exports are equivalent to nearly a third of the UK's GDP, and UK is the fifth biggest exporter in the world."
280,280,The Sun,Harry Cole,MP Margaret Ferrier put overnight stay on EXPENSES after travelling 700 miles with Covid,"AN MP who travelled from Glasgow to London and back with Covid faces a fresh outcry for putting the overnight stay on expenses. Ex-SNP star Margaret Ferrier, 60, was condemned for making the 700-mile round trip to Westminster while suffering from the bug in September. Now, expenses claims published by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority show that she charged the taxpayer £175 for her overnight hotel stay. The claim shows her paying for three nights in a central London hotel but getting a refund for the cost of two nights after she tested positive and dashed back up north. The claim is within the rules but likely to spark uproar. Ms Ferrier made the journey on September 28 despite displaying symptoms of the virus and spoke for four minutes in the Commons. She tested positive that evening but still stayed at a hotel in London before getting the train back to Glasgow the next day. Ms Ferrier was booted out of the SNP by leader Nicola Sturgeon when the scandal broke last year and was arrested in January for putting lives at risk. Police Scotland charged her with culpable and reckless conduct — an offence that can carry a life term. But despite demands for her to quit her seat, Ms Ferrier is now an independent MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West. If she is convicted and jailed, her constituents will have the right to organise a petition to recall her and trigger a by-election. Last night, Ferrier had not responded to The Sun's request for a comment."
281,281,The Sun,Harry Cole,"Brits WILL enjoy pub gardens, shops and hairdressers from April 12 as Boris Johnson unlocks Britain","BORIS Johnson WILL give pub gardens, shops and hairdressers the green light to reopen on April 12 when he addresses the nation on Monday. Though warning families not to bend the rules by meeting indoors or groups bigger than six this Easter, the Prime Minister will announce cases and deaths have dropped enough to give next phase of unlocking the go. Multiple sources told The Sun the PM ""is confident"" the good news Covid data allows more easing of restrictions and will give retailers and landlords their promised 7 days notice in an address on Bank Holiday Monday. Shops, beer gardens, gyms and outdoor restaurants will be allowed to reopen after 99 days of shutdown. April 12 marks five weeks since the first easing of lockdown on March 8 when schools reopened. The next tranche of restrictions are due to be lifted five weeks later on May 17 when its hoped hospitality can serve indoors and families can meet inside. The Good Friday good news comes as vaccine data soared and bug cases and deaths plummeted. The latest data showed 36,249,902 jabs have given in the UK so far, 31,301,267 were first doses - a rise of 153,823 on Thursday. Some 4,948,635 were second doses, an increase of 435,177, with half of over 80s having now been jabbed twice. And cases of the bug dropped by a quarter last week - yesterday there were just 3402 confirmed cases - down 26.6 per cent in seven days. But in a video message, the PM insisted the country is ""not yet"" at the stage where families and friends can meet inside, even if they have been vaccinated. Mr Johnson added: ""We're very much in a world where you can meet friends and family outdoors under the rule of six or two households. ""And even though friends and family members may be vaccinated, the vaccines are not giving 100 per cent protection and that's why we just need to be cautious. ""We don't think they entirely reduce or remove the risk of transmission."" Downing Street sources defended the strict rules for the jabs, saying the roadmap was carefully designed to avoid cases flaring up and data was still unclear about how effective the jabs are at cutting transmission. Mr Johnson is also expected to unveil plans for vaccine passports to allow businesses to drop social distancing measures this summer if they check punters have been jabbed or tested. But he is facing a growing backlash from the hospitality industry for the plan. UK Hospitality said it would be a massive unfair burden on the already hammered sector and urged a rethink. But Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden hit back: ""This is not about a vaccine passport, this is about looking at ways of proving that you are Covid secure, whether you have had a test or had the vaccine. ""Clearly, no decisions have been made on that, because we have to weigh up different factors, the ethical considerations and so on, but it may be a way of ensuring we can get more people back doing the things they love."""

283,283,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha Clark,Brits could be swapping Spain for Bahrain under new summer holiday traffic lights system,"BRITS seeking quarantine-free hols will have to swap Spain for Bahrain under new travel rules. Sluggish jab rates and Covid variants have dashed hopes of a European getaway this summer. But the Gulf state, with its rapid rollout, gets a green light under plans unveiled next week. Summer holiday hotspots will be ranked under a new traffic lights system — letting Brits fly to ""green"" countries with low Covid rates and strong vaccine rollouts. The move, to be unveiled by Boris Johnson, will see Bahrain, Dubai and the US top destination wish lists. But nations with high virus cases and slow jab rollouts will require more quarantining. That could deter millions of Brits from heading to Spain's Benidorm and other European favourites such as France and Greece. The PM will also set out how Brits can use vaccine passports to travel. But he will warn that June could be the earliest that borders can open. Boris will publish the findings of the Global Travel Taskforce on Monday. A source involved told The Sun: ""Jab rates will play a crucial part in determining a country's status."" Under the traffic lights plan: GREEN: Anyone returning from these countries must take a pre-flight lateral flow test at their own cost, then take a ""sequencing test"" within days of landing to check for new strains; AMBER: Like green but those entering the UK must isolate at home for ten days after arrival. They can get out after five days with a negative test paid for privately; RED: Arrivals must isolate on their return in an authorised hotel at their own cost — as they do currently. So far, the US, Gulf states and Israel would be classed as ""Green"" thanks to their jab rollouts. Israel leads the world with 110 doses per 100 residents, followed by the United Arab Emirates with 84.1 and Bahrain with 46 per 100. America has 44.6, Britain 52.4 and Malta is Europe's second best at 37. Most of Europe is poised for Amber status. France, which plunged into another month of lockdown this week, has jabbed just 16 per 100 citizens. Spain and Italy are at 16.5 and Greece 15.6. Speaking on a visit to Hartlepool yesterday, Mr Johnson said: ""I'm afraid you can see what's happening in France. It's very sad actually."" Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye backed the plans to put countries with high vaccination levels first. He told the BBC: ""If you look at Israel, very low Covid levels, very high vaccination levels, they should be one of the first to be opened up to international travel. ""Then of course the United States, a massive market for the UK — 20 per cent of our passengers are going to and from the US. ""They have high vaccination levels and low Covid levels. They should be at the front of the queue."" Mr Johnson will address the country on Bank Holiday Monday as he gives a week's notice on whether pubs can reopen on April 12. He will set out how Covid certificates will work, but is also expected to say it is too soon to put a date on switching on the travel traffic lights. Travel was meant to be restored ""not before"" May 17. But there is growing concern in Whitehall that this is too soon amid a third virus wave globally. Mr Johnson is also under pressure from devolved leaders to delay reopening Britain's borders. Wales First Minister Mark Drakeford said May 17 was over-optimistic and did not reflect the risk of re-importing the virus and new variants from other parts of the world. He added: ""When the Prime Minister speaks next week I hope he will say that date is having to be pushed back."" Sir Keir Starmer claimed any vaccine passports would be ""un-British"". The Labour boss said he didn't think people would support them, putting him on a collision course with Mr Johnson, who has suggested they will ""definitely"" have a role for travel. Sir Keir said: ""My instinct is that, as the vaccine is rolled out, as the number of hospital admissions and deaths go down, there will be a British sense that we don't actually want to go down this road."" Mr Johnson hit back, saying some countries would certainly bring them in. He said: ""There's definitely going to be a world in which international travel will use vaccine passports. ""You can see already that other countries and the aviation industry are interested in this, and there is a logic to that."" Ministers have concluded their work on how the vaccine certificates may work and will meet on Monday morning to decide whether to proceed. Essential buildings such as hospitals, GP surgeries and supermarkets are likely to be excluded from any such scheme. They could be optional for other businesses. The PM yesterday stressed again that any moves towards vaccine passports for domestic use would involve a three-pronged approach of vaccines, tests or proof of antibodies. It would mean people who could not have the vaccine for medical reasons would not miss out on a trip to the pub or restaurant. The PM said yesterday: ""When it comes to trying to make sure that we give maximum confidence to businesses and customers, there are three things — there's immunity whether you have had it before so you have natural antibodies, whether you have been vaccinated, and of course whether you have had a test."" But last night 70 cross-party MPs signed a pledge opposing the ""divisive and discriminatory use"" of the passports. Forty Tories broke cover to oppose the use of certification ""to deny individuals access to general services, businesses or jobs"". Sir Iain Duncan Smith, Esther McVey and Mark Harper are among those from the Covid Recovery Group who have backed the call. Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee, who has repeatedly spoken in favour of speeding up England's unlocking, said: ""Covid-status certification would be divisive and discriminatory. ""With high levels of vaccination protecting the vulnerable and making transmission less likely, we should aim to return to normal life, not put permanent restrictions in place."""
284,284,The Sun,Harry Cole,"Taxpayers will fork out £900,000 to keep Glastonbury Festival going despite two cancellations","TAXPAYERS will keep Glastonbury Festival alive with a grant of £900,000, it was disclosed yesterday. Money will land in the event's coffers after two Covid cancellations cost organisers millions. It is part of a £400million tranche of Culture Recovery Fund grants and loans for the arts. In all, £1.2billion has been paid so far. Glastonbury is held over five days at Pilton, Somerset, and is a major event in the UK's music calendar. It was launched in 1970 by Michael Eavis who co-organises with daughter, Emily. They said they were ""extremely grateful"" for the ""significant award"". In a statement, they said: ""After losing millions from the cancellation of our last two festivals, this grant will make a huge difference in helping secure our future."" Glastonbury, which raises millions for charity, is said to have lost £5million last year but less this year as the cancellation was earlier. A live-stream, with Coldplay among acts, will still be aired on May 22, with tickets £20-a-pop to cover costs. More than 2,700 organisations have been helped in the latest grants splurge. The overall total exceeds 5,000. Recipients this time include The National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Football Museum. Theatres have received almost £60million and independent cinemas £6.5million. Charlestown Harbour in Cornwall, where Poldark is filmed, gets £109,500. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said thousands of organisations had had help to ""survive the biggest crisis they've ever faced"". He said: ""Now we're staying by their side as they prepare to welcome the public back — helping our cultural gems plan for reopening and thrive in the better times ahead."""
285,285,The Sun,Harry ColeMatt Wilkinson,The Queen gets her second Covid vaccine dose before heading out for first public event after five months in lockdown,"THE Queen has joined millions of other Brits in receiving her second Covid jab. Her Maj, 94, was given the shot ahead of her first public appearance in five months yesterday. She went maskless and was cheered at an air force celebration in Runnymede, Surrey, following months in her Windsor Castle bubble. The Sun can reveal a staggering 99.25 per cent of people offered a second vaccine dose have turned up to appointments so far. Her Majesty told crowds she was ""delighted"" to be outdoors in her first public engagement since November. She stepped out of her bubble and was treated to a Red Arrows flypast at the centenary celebrations of the Royal Australian Air Force. The Queen told onlookers at the Air Forces Memorial in Runnymede, Surrey: ""It is a rather nice day. I'm delighted to be here."" Australian High Commissioner George Brandis QC told her travel rules had stranded many Aussies in the UK. She quickly replied: ""There are worse places to be stuck."" The Queen wore a green and ivory dress and jacket by Angela Kelly with matching hat, plus a wattle brooch gifted to her on her first tour of Australia in 1954. Her last public engagement had been at Porton Down, Wiltshire, in October alongside Prince William. She led Remembrance Sunday at the Cenotaph on November 8. Husband Philip, 99, was absent yesterday after recent heart surgery and a month in hospital. Their first jabs were announced on January 9. Yesterday Palace aides refused to comment officially on their second vaccines. But a source said: ""Given the Queen has decided to make a public appearance so close to 12 weeks after the announcement of receiving her first vaccine it is clear she has already had her second. ""Aides won't have wanted to put her at any risk. ""It is obviously much more reassuring to know that anyone who has received two doses of the vaccine is so well protected — even aged 94."" Some studies say that would give her close to 100 per cent immunity from contracting a life-threatening dose of the disease. The Sun can reveal an amazing 99.25 per cent of Brits have turned up for their second jab appointments. Yesterday the UK passed the 30.9million milestone of first doses. And for the first time more second doses were put into arms than first. Latest figures reveal 270,526 Brits got a second jab on Tuesday, taking the total to 4.1million. Brits have embraced the vaccine programme despite fake news about the jabs spreading across Europe. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said last night: ""Getting the second dose is so important to maintaining protection for yourself and your loved ones. ""The programme is a huge success for the UK and I am delighted that so many people are coming forward for their first dose but also crucially their second. ""When Sun readers get the call, they should get the jab."" Yesterday daily Covid deaths were at 43 — taking the weekly total to 332, that is 40 per cent down on the previous week. The number of patients hospitalised by the pandemic has seen a 23 per cent weekly fall. Dr Yvonne Doyle, of Public Health England, warned: ""We are not out of the woods yet. ""Until we are all protected it remains essential to follow the steps we know stop the virus from spreading."" Yesterday regulator the European Medicines Agency (EMA) again ruled the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab safe despite Germany slapping a ban on its use in the under-60s. Chancellor Angela Merkel brought in the ban over unfounded links to blot clots. But EMA executive director Emer Cooke said: ""According to the current scientific knowledge, there is no evidence that would support restricting the use of this vaccine in any population."" There have been 44 cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis — a rare type of blood clot on the brain — in 9.2million Europeans given the Oxford vaccine. However, experts say a link is not proven. And Covid infection itself is known to trigger blood clots. UK experts have said the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh any potential risks and have declared it ""safe and effective"". This view is echoed by the World Health Organisation which has urged countries to continue using it. Cabinet Minister Robert Jenrick stressed: ""We are 100 per cent confident in the vaccine here."" Meanwhile Germany and France were last night slammed for flirting with Vladimir Putin over the Sputnik V vaccine — after trashing the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab. Italian MEP Paolo Borchia said Paris and Berlin were motivated by an ""obsessive hatred of Brexit Britain"". He warned: ""They would rather hand Putin's Russia a PR victory on Sputnik than use the British AZ vaccine which they have already paid for. ""President Macron and Chancellor Merkel detest a democratic Britain so much they are willing to hug the big Russian Bear."" And ex-Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage fumed: ""For years I was slandered in the EU Parliament for 'Russian Collusion'. ""Now France and Germany want the Sputnik vaccine. ""The hypocrisy is incredible."" Brits have overwhelmingly backed vaccine passports in new Ipsos MORI research. Nearly two thirds said they should be needed in bars and restaurants. Similar levels said they should be used for gyms. Nearly eight in ten said they should be used for trips abroad. Yet a quarter believe ethical and legal concerns of such a move outweighed the potential benefits to unlocking the economy. And half believe passports could lead to more inequality in society. IS it any wonder the EU's citizens are so terrified of vaccines? One minute the Oxford jab is deemed safe only for one age group. The next it's unsafe for them — but safe for others. The latest edict in Germany is that under-60s shouldn't have it because of some unproven link to rare blood clots. Angela Merkel is still happy to have it, though (having previously turned it down). And the European Medicines Agency confirms yet again that there is ""no evidence"" of any risk. Confused? This mad panic is based on 31 clotting cases from 2.7million jabbed Germans. Scientists have no idea whether the drug caused them. They occur naturally anyway. Even if there is some tiny risk, it is vastly outweighed by the dangers of Covid itself, which include blood clots. But this is not just damaging for the already sluggish rollout in Germany and across the EU. It's a huge blow to the image of a fantastic vaccine which much of the world is relying on. We only hope others follow Brits' lead, since an incredible 99.25 per cent of us are taking up our second doses with no qualms at all. It helps that 18million have already had the Oxford/AstraZeneca shot and our drugs regulator says there is no evidence it causes clots. The jab HAS had a terrible press abroad. It is vital for the makers and our Government to push back. It is low-cost and easily stored . . . crucial advantages for poorer countries. For the world to conquer Covid we cannot afford for this epidemic of baseless doubt to spread around the globe."
286,286,The Sun,Harry Cole,"Tech giants risk tarnishing golden decade of football by not tackling online racism, Culture Secretary warns","TECH giants risk tarnishing a golden decade of football by not doing enough to tackle online racism, the Culture Secretary says today. After we told of Thierry Henry's web hell, Oliver Dowden said the Arsenal legend's evidence was ""too toxic to be ignored"". Facebook, Google and Twitter face fines of billions unless they take action now — with Whitehall drawing up laws that could take ten per cent of their global revenue unless they do more. Mr Dowden said he held ""shocking"" chats with players, including Sun columnist Troy Deeney, and it was clear that abuse has migrated from ""the stands to social media"". He said inaction could cast a shadow over the decade of football ahead in which the UK hosts Euro matches this summer and the Women's Euros come here next year, and we bid for the 2030 World Cup. He added the time had come for firms to ""deploy their brilliant engineers"" to strip the sites of hate. His call in The Sun comes after a government race relations report sparked a row by concluding that the country is a ""beacon"" to the world. Dr Tony Sewell wrote in his report: ""We no longer see a Britain where the system is deliberately rigged against ethnic minorities."" The report did say that social media firms don't do enough to tackle racism. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called its findings disappointing. And race campaigners rejected the dossier, saying it failed to take into account the ""lived experience"" of many Brits. By Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden Sadly, racism in football seems to have moved from the stands to social media. I recently spoke to a group of footballers, including Sun columnist Troy Deeney, to hear directly about the abuse they face and what they'd like their Government to do about it. They were very open, and it was shocking to hear about the racist abuse they deal with on a daily basis. As Thierry Henry said, this situation is too toxic to ignore - and I'm determined to tackle it. After a terrible couple of seasons due to Covid, we should be looking forward to a golden decade of football. The enthusiasm of the post-lockdown kickoff on Monday shows the strength of the grassroots. The women's game is flourishing. We are building better all-weather facilities in every corner of the country. We will be proud hosts of the Euros this summer and the Women's Euros next, and we are starting exploratory work on our bid for the World Cup in 2030. So let's not allow online abuse to tarnish our game. Let's not force footballers to choose between either engaging with their fans and having to see racist comments all hours of the day, or come off social media altogether. We've been working on new laws to make the online world safer. It's complex, and we have to get it right, and ensure freedom of expression. But I firmly believe we can have a free and open internet without hateful, racist comments going unchecked. Companies have a clear picture of what our laws will do. They can deploy their brilliant engineers right now to stop racist remarks being posted and shared. I believe them when they say they want their platforms to be positive and safe places. So let's see the action now."
287,287,The Sun,Harry ColeNick McDermottNick Gutteridge,A staggering 99.25 per cent of Brits have turned up to their second Covid vaccine appointments so far,"A STAGGERING 99.25 per cent of Brits have turned up to their second jab appointments so far, The Sun can reveal. Today for the first time more second doses were put into arms than first. Official figures reveal 270,526 vulnerable Brits got their second shots on Tuesday – taking the total number of fully immunised adults to 4.1million. Ministers say April will be the ""second dose month"", as the UK flew past the 30.9 million milestone of first doses - with millions needing their second jab after 12 weeks. Despite a torrent of fake news about the jabs, Brits have voted with their feet, queuing up for their second doses with barely any cancellations in a major snub to loud mouthed EU chiefs. The thumping endorsement for the Oxford AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines flies in the face of dangerous fake news pumped out by France's reckless President Macron. And today the European Medical Agency again ruled the AZ jab safe despite Germany slapping a ban on using it on under 55s. Macron and Angela Merkel were also slammed for cosying up to Russia's President Putin with talks about securing doses of the Russian's controversial Sputnik V vaccine. Tonight Health Secretary Matt Hancock declared: ""Getting the second dose is so important to maintaining protection for yourself and your loved ones. ""The vaccine programme is a huge success for the U. K. and I am delighted that so many people are coming forward for their first dose but also crucially their second. ""When Sun readers get the call, they should get the jab,"" he added. Our revelation comes as a smiling Queen stepped out of lockdown for the first time in almost five months - free of her mask and raising hopes she has joined millions in receiving her second jab. Her Majesty appeared at her first public engagement since November to pay tribute to hero airmen telling crowds she was ""delighted"" to be outdoors. It is just under 12 weeks since it was officially announced on January 9 that she and Prince Philip had already received their first vaccine. And her first public outing beyond her strict Covid ""bubble"" inside Windsor Castle today raised the possibility that she has already had her second jab. Studies say that would give her close to 100 per cent immunity from contracting a life-threatening dose of the disease. Daily Covid deaths were 43 today taking the weekly total to 332 – a 40 per cent drop on the previous seven days. And the number of patients hospitalised by the pandemic has seen a 23 per cent weekly fall. Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director of Public Health England, warned ""We're not out of the woods quite yet. She urged the nation not to ""drop our guard"". ""Until all of us are protected it remains essential to follow the steps we know stop the virus from spreading."" Today EU regulators once again slapped down safety fears around the Oxford/AstraZeneca after Germany suspended its use in under-60s. Chancellor Angela Merkel brought in the ban over unfounded links to blot clots. But the boss of the European Medicines Agency said there is ""no evidence"" to support restricting its use. There have been 44 cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis – a rare type of blood clot on the brain – in 9.2 million Europeans given the Oxford vaccine. However, experts say a ""causal link is not proven"". EMA executive director Emer Cooke said: ""According to the current scientific knowledge, there is no evidence that would support restricting the use of this vaccine in any population."" The regulator is now carrying out an ongoing review of the jab and will report next week – but has yet to identify any specific risk factors. Covid infection itself is known to trigger blood clots. UK experts have said the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh any potential risks and have declared it ""safe and effective"". This view is echoed by the World Health Organisation, which has urged countries to continue using it. And Cabinet Minister Robert Jenrick hit back: ""We are 100 pc confident in the vaccine here."" Meanwhile Germany and France were tonight slammed for flirting with Vladimir Putin over the Sputnik V vaccine after trashing the AstraZeneca jab. Italian MEP Paolo Borchia said Paris and Berlin were being motivated by an ""obsessive hatred of Brexit Britain"". He warned: ""They would rather hand Putin's Russia a PR victory on the Sputnik jab rather that used the British AZ vaccine which they have already paid for. ""Macron and Merkel detest a democratic Britain so much they are willing to hug the big Russian Bear. Kirill Dmitriev of the Putin backed Russian Direct Investment Fund says Merkel told Putin in a call on Tuesday night that she may purchase Sputnik doses behind the EU's back. He told the BBC: ""Germany specifically said that even if European Commission will not decide to buy vaccine, Germany will consider direct purchase."" Lithuanian MEP Petras Auštrevičius said Moscow was using the shot as ""a well-directed PR stunt"" and urged the bloc to reject it. He told The Sun: ""Russia is exploiting the Covid-19 pandemic to portray itself as a global power with a so-called strong humanitarian policy line. Former Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage fumed: ""For years I was slandered in the EU Parliament for 'Russian Collusion'. ""Now France and Germany want the Sputnik vaccine. The hypocrisy is incredible."" So far 233,295 doses of the Russian vaccine have been administered in Europe, all in Hungary. The country received another 250,000 shots overnight as it breaks away from the bloc's main jabs scheme. Austria is set to become the second EU member to buy them in, and plans to place an order for a million jabs next week, Chancellor Sebastian Kurtz said: ""There must be no geopolitical blinkers when it comes to vaccines."" Other states like Italy, the Czech Republic, Slovakia are also looking at signing contracts."
288,288,The Sun,Harry Cole,Success of ethnic minority Brits should be seen as ‘a beacon’ to the rest of the world,"THE success of ethnic minority Brits should be seen as ""a beacon"" to the rest of the world a landmark review into race relations has concluded. Elite professions like law and medicine are leading the way on equality and many ethnic minority kids do ""substantially better"" than white children in the classroom. It finds that the ethnic pay gap has shrunk to 2.3pc in 2019, and amongst under 30s was virtually non-existent. But the government review concludes the cesspit of the internet is letting the nation down where ""overt and outright racism persists in the UK"". It warms some communities continue to be ""haunted"" by ""historic cases"" of racism, creating ""deep mistrust"" in the system which could prove a barrier to success. However it finds the well-meaning ""idealism"" of many young people who claim the country is still institutionally racist ""is not borne out by the evidence."" But it warns ""both the reality and the perception of unfairness matter"". The Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities was set up by Boris Johnson in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests last year. Their 264 page review makes 24 recommendations to the government including scrapping controversial ""unconscious bias training"" and extending the school day for disadvantaged kids. It will take aim at big tech firms calling for tougher penalties on firms who do not take down racist content. It concludes: ""Abuse experienced 'online', in other words through social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Instagram, also has a significant impact on victims."" And it adds ""Failing to comply should lead to substantial penalties – and public naming and shaming for their seeming intransigence to the pain racism causes its victim."" But the report says we should not shy away from the fact that ethnic communities have helped transform British society over the last 50 years into a much fairer country. It reads: ""Education is the single most emphatic success story of the British ethnic minority experience. ""The Commission notes that the average GCSE Attainment 8 score for Indian, Bangladeshi and Black African pupils were above the White British average."" Commission chairman Tony Sewell said: ""Another revelation from our dive into the data was just how stuck some groups from the white majority are. ""As a result, we came to the view that recommendations should, wherever possible, be designed to remove obstacles for everyone, rather than specific groups."" Dr Sewell added: ""Creating a successful multi-ethnic society is hard, and racial disparities exist wherever such a society is being forged. But he said his report would give a ""burst of momentum to the story of our country's progress to a successful multi-ethnic and multicultural community – a beacon to the rest of Europe and the world."""
289,289,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Keir Starmer forces Labour MP exposed by The Sun for calling business people ‘the enemy’ to apologise,"A LABOUR frontbencher exposed by The Sun for calling business people ""the enemy"" has been forced into an apology. Furious party boss Sir Keir Starmer slammed his own shadow minister, saying: ""Alex Sobel knows what he said was wrong. He has apologised. He's apologised to me."" And he insisted: ""The Labour Party, under my leadership, is very clearly pro-business."" The slap down came after we exposed comments made by the shadow tourism minister about business people. Mr Sobel told a podcast: ""When I first became an MP, I was like, I am not taking meetings with any of these people. These people are the enemy, you know. ""I'm a socialist, my job is to effectively transform society so that we have a much more mixed economy and we don't have huge global corporations which have all this power. WE almost feel sorry for Keir Starmer. There he is, maintaining the fiction that he has moved Labour on from Corbyn, when a leftie shadow minister is caught branding business ""the enemy"". The reality is that far too many Starmer MPs are just thinly-disguised Corbynites. Their adolescent politics align them instinctively with every fashionably woke or anti-capitalist cause, no matter how toxic with voters. And, let's face it, Starmer — who campaigned devotedly to install the old Marxist in No10 — is not immune either. Which may explain why Labour, opposing a Government engulfed by the gravest crisis since 1940, is nose-diving in the polls. ""That is still my dream, but we haven't got time to do that and save the climate."" The Hartlepool by-election will be a key test of Sir Keir's leadership. The May 6 contest will give an indication of whether the Labour leader can shore up support in the party's former industrial heartlands after large sections of the so-called ""red wall"" crumbled in the 2019 general election."
290,290,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Anti-China group of MPs hit by mysterious cyber attack just days after Beijing sanctions,"POLITICIANS sanctioned by China have suffered a crippling cyber attack just days after being hammered by Beijing, The Sun can reveal. A group of MPs and Lords campaigning for tougher global action against the Communist superpower were hit by an attack on their website's server - now being probed by spooks. IPAC, the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, saw their website taken offline on Monday evening in a mysterious digital blitzkrieg. The group includes ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith and former minister Nusrat Ghani - who were both slapped with personal sanctions by Beijing last week. Now IPAC have turned to GCHQ's National Cyber Security arm to boost their online protection. The culprits have yet to be identified but key figures in the group have pointed the finger firmly at Beijing-backing hackers and vow they will not be silenced. Relations between Britain and China sunk to a new low last week after the Eastern powerhouse banned a number of critical MPs and peers from entering the country. Their crime is accusing the Communist regime of genocide against the Muslim Uighur population in Xinjiang. Beijing retaliated after Britain, the US, Canada and the EU introduced restrictions on Monday on Chinese officials responsible for abuses in the province. Last night IPAC's coordinator Luke de Pulford told The Sun: ""This isn't the first time we have been attacked. ""But – while Beijing's mysterious supporters might be able to knock us off the internet for a few hours – nothing will stop our members standing up for the Uyghurs, Hong Kongers, and everyone else oppressed by China."" Last night the National Cyber Security Centre said: ""We understand the website is now running as normal. ""We are working to fully understand the nature of this incident and have offered technical support."""
291,291,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha Clark,Tennis-mad PM urges Brits to get fit outdoors & reveals  60million new jabs will be made in the UK,"THE PM yesterday said Brits could boost resilience to Covid by getting fit in the sun — and revealed 60million new jabs will be made in the UK. Boris Johnson said he could not wait to play tennis again as lockdown is eased. He added: ""We can take advantage of this beautiful weather to build national resilience."" The new Novavax jab is also being produced in the North East, he said. He hailed the ""significant new weapon in the armoury"" against the virus as we took a ""small step to freedom"" yesterday. With cooped-up Brits flocking outside for long-awaited meet-ups, he said: ""I know how much it will have meant to millions of people to have joined someone else for a cup of tea in the garden."" Organised sports were also once again allowed across the country, with busy golf courses, tennis courts and swimming pools. Stressing the benefits of exercise to build ""resilience"" to Covid, Mr Johnson said: ""I am personally thrilled that I will be able to play tennis, for instance."" He went on: ""We can take advantage of this moment and the beautiful weather to play sport, to take exercise, to have fun and build our national resilience in that way too."" He also used yesterday's milestone to unveil a new jab bottling factory in the North East. After weeks of sniping with Brussels over threats to block exports of vaccines to the UK, 60million doses will be made domestically. Drugs giant GlaxoSmithKline will use its plant at Barnard Castle, Co Durham, to bottle the new Novavax jab, currently pending a green light from the regulator. The Barnard Castle revelation came almost a year to the day since the PM's then-aide Dominic Cummings broke lockdown rules with a day trip to the market town. He later claimed he was testing his eyesight, and the subsequent row over the Brexit guru's visit knocked the Government for six. Last night social media erupted at the news, with the Prime Minister's supporters declaring the choice of town as ""epic banter"" while critics accused him of ""trolling the public"". Speaking at the Downing Street press conference, Mr Johnson said: ""At the same time as we push forwards with our programme to offer a vaccination to all adults by the end of July, we're building up our own long-term UK manufacturing capabilities. ""Novavax, a potentially significant new weapon in our armoury against Covid, is going to be made at FujiFilm in the North East. ""I can today announce that the Vaccine Taskforce has reached an agreement with GlaxoSmithKline to finish and bottle this precious fluid also in the North East, giving us between 50 and 60million doses of UK-made vaccine subject to the right approvals from the MHRA."" In a dig at Brussels' rollout failures, Health Secretary Matt Hancock added: ""We've all seen just how important onshore vaccine manufacturing capabilities are, and this fantastic deal will ensure more of these vital products can be produced here in the UK."" In a further boost, people in England can now travel up and down the country, it emerged yesterday. It was expected that the ""stay home"" message would be replaced with ""stay local"" guidance. But instead people were told to ""minimise travel"" — with no limits on how far people can drive to see loved ones. A Whitehall source said last night: ""There's an understanding that people are going to travel to see relatives after all this time."" Minister Nigel Huddleston urged people to think carefully before going anywhere — but confirmed there would be no curbs on distance. He toldSky News: ""What we don't want is people intermixing in different parts of the country to any greater degree than necessary."" People will also be allowed to nip into friends' homes to use the loo — or go through them to get to the garden. I must stress that it is only because of months of sacrifice and effort that we can take this small step to freedom today. But ministers and medics spent the day urging people: ""Just please be sensible."" Mr Johnson also thanked Brits who had ""overwhelmingly"" obeyed the rules over the past 85 days. He said: ""I must stress that it is only because of months of sacrifice and effort that we can take this small step to freedom today."" On a day that saw the lowest virus rates in six months, the PM added: ""What we need to do is continue flat-out to build the immunity of our population."" Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical officer, said most of those at greatest risk of death or serious illness from Covid had now received the jab. But he warned it spreads most rapidly among younger age groups which had yet to be vaccinated. There were already signs of an increase in infections among children of school age following the reopening of classes in England earlier this month, he added. Scientists and ministers also warned people not to hug friends and family just yet — and to stay socially distanced if they can. Mr Huddleston urged people to ""call out"" family and friends who do not stick to the rules. He added: ""Please don't do the hugging. At the moment the message is, 'Still be cautious'."" Asked when Brits could embrace again, ex-Government adviser Sir Mark Walport said: ""When the evidence shows that the case number is really, really low indeed."" Up to a million people living with extremely vulnerable Brits are also being bumped up the queue for Covid jabs. Households of those with a weakened immune system will now be prioritised for the vaccine, as it helps stop spread of the infection. It includes adults residing with a patient with blood cancer, HIV or undergoing chemotherapy. Officials say the move could result in a million extra people being prioritised. Mr Hancock has asked the NHS to offer a first Covid dose to these as soon as possible."
292,292,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha Clark,Brit holidaymakers will be kept waiting WEEKS longer to find out when they can go abroad as ‘picture still too bleak’,"MINISTERS will keep holidaymakers on tenterhooks for weeks to come over foreign jaunts, The Sun can reveal. Next week's review of international travel will likely conclude that it's too soon to say when the borders can be reopened. Dashing the hopes of thousands of Brits who have booked getaways for May and June, Government sources say ""the picture is still too bleak to make a clear decision."" It was hoped that foreign travel could resume by 17 May, but Europe's brutal Covid third wave has cast huge doubt on that date. It comes as: Experts earlier said the biggest risk to Britain was now the risk of importing variants back into the UK, which may put the vaccine programme at risk. Speaking at his press conference last night the PM confirmed that an update on holidays will be unveiled on April 5, Easter Monday. When asked about whether Brits would be able to travel abroad to see their families, Mr Johnson said the most important thing is to continue to vaccinate people in ""great numbers"". He added he'll soon reveal ""what the global travel taskforce has come up with"". But sources told The Sun: ""Don't expect a firm date then."" The PM said: ""We will be saying more about seeing family abroad and travel abroad, but it won't be until at least April 5. ""Clearly at the moment, lots of countries are on a red list, where we have very stringent measures in place."" Matt Hancock refused to be drawn either way, but stressed that the ""door is not shut"" on foreign trips. The Health Secretary refused to say either way whether people could go on a summer break, but stressed it was still too early to make any final calls. But scientists were more pessimistic, saying they would be planning for summer breaks in the UK instead. Chris Whitty said one of the main worries about opening up the country for international travel was the risk of importing a new variant from abroad. He said: ""The main thing we're concerned about is the risk of importing into the UK variants which could have a reduced effectiveness of the vaccines we're currently using. ""In the short term, that is the principal thing that's driving concerns about border issues at this stage."" And Professor Sir Mark Walport, former chief scientific adviser to the Government, said data must be a key part in making any decisions. He said: ""Certainly at the moment many countries in Europe have got case numbers that are going up - there [are] 36,000 cases a day in France, 16,000 in Germany, 22,000 in Italy. ""The numbers speak for themselves."""
293,293,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha Clark,Labour frontbencher under fire after calling business people ‘the enemy’,"A LABOUR frontbencher was slammed last night after describing business as ""the enemy"". Sir Keir Starmer is under pressure to ditch his shadow tourism minister Alex Sobel who said he only talks to business people because of climate change. The MP for Leeds North West told a podcast that when he first came into office he would refuse to meet with any firms. And he said he only speaks to them now to get them to go green and become eco-friendly before it's too late. The MP, who is also a backer of the hardcore climate extremists Extinction Rebellion, said: ""When I first became an MP, I was like, I am not taking meetings with any of these people. ""These people are the enemy, you know."" He said that as a socialist, his ""job is to transform society"" and tear up ""global corporations which have all this power"". But he was forced to suck up his views sit down at the table with them because ""we haven't got enough time"" to save the planet and reinvent the economy at the same time. Speaking to podcaster Simon Moore, Mr Sobel added: ""That is still my dream, but we haven't got time to do that and save the climate."" But Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng lashed out at the controversial comments, saying: ""Attacking business is straight out of the Corbyn playbook."" The Tory Cabinet Minister told The Sun: ""Businesses aren't the enemy – they're good for society. They create jobs, support livelihoods and generate the tax revenue that funds our NHS, police and schools. ""Sir Keir should show some leadership, call off the attacks and distance himself from these comments."" And ex-Labour MP Lord Austin added: ""Keir Starmer is trying to drag the  Labour Party back to common-sense but keeps being undermined by this sort of silly infantile nonsense most people grow out of as teenagers."" Labour sources said Mr Sobel no longer held the views about business and had moved on. A Labour spokesperson said last night: ""Combining the power of government and business will be crucial to Britain's future, whether that is tackling climate change or creating new jobs across the country. ""That's why we oppose Tory tax hikes on business in the middle of the pandemic."""
294,294,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Ministers use of secret ‘Mission Impossible’ texting app faces courtroom showdown,"BORIS Johnson's alleged use of an ultra-secretive messaging app that destroys texts after sending faces a courtroom challenge. Last year The Sun revealed the PM had joined Signal, the most secure digital communication app on the open market, alongside a host of other ministers and officials. It gives users the option of being able to self-destruct their messages within a set period of time, from a week down to just five seconds. Disappearing messages are liked by senior Government figures because they help limit leaks. But transparency campaigners fear it is a loophole to avoid scrutiny from  Freedom of Information laws and are threatening legal action. The law states all such communications must be retained forever like emails but there are growing concerns ministers and aides are bypassing this by using the self-destructing instant messages. A spokesperson for campaign group Citizens claims: ""Government business is being conducted under a cloak of secrecy enabled by the tech platforms."" They added: ""This entire period of British history is going to be one giant black hole. We are in an unprecedented national emergency and we are going to have no records of how decisions were made or even who made them."" They have joined forces with anti-big tech group Foxglove as they mull legal action. Their boss Cori Crider said: ""We're deeply concerned by this government's approach to data - it seems to involve collecting more and more information on all of us, while we have less and less information on our own representatives. "" And she threatened: ""Privacy is for the people – transparency is for the government. And if we have to sue to tip the scales back in favour of the citizen, so be it."" The campaigners have given ministers 14 days to give a clear explanation of how the secret messages are monitored and stored - and accessible by FoI - or they will begin Judicial Review proceedings. Asked about the PM's social media habits his spokesman said last night: ""We abide by all the relevant data laws. We are transparent."" They added: ""We of course abide by the FoI laws to ensure that any questions asked are responded to in a timely fashion."" FAR too much Downing Street business is done in secret. That has worsened since everyone from the PM down began using Signal, a highly-encrypted messaging app which automatically deletes texts. It means hugely important conversations — about policy failures, or maybe worse — are impossible for the public or Press to scrutinise via Freedom of Information requests or even court order. It is a licence for cover-ups. The Sun revealed this practice last May. Now the Government faces a legal challenge — and we hope it succeeds. Ministers do need to secure  communications against hostile states' hackers. But they must be accountable too for how critical decisions are arrived at. That is not possible if no one can ever prove who said what and to who."
295,295,The Sun,Harry Cole,Online junk food ad ban to be axed as it would have almost no effect on obesity,"AN online junk-food ads ban is to be axed as it would have almost no effect on obesity. The proposal would cut a child's annual calorie intake by just 700 — equivalent to four packets of crisps. Following a review, Whitehall insiders say ministers now accept that a boycott would be ""disproportionate"" as it would cost businesses tens of millions. PM Boris Johnson backed an online crackdown following his battle with Covid, saying he and the nation were too fat. But food and drink manufacturers said the proposal was flawed and would banish adverts for family favourites such as Marmite and mustard. A letter from firms behind 3,000 brands said there would be many unintended victims. They asked if it was really the plan to stop, for example, a wedding cake maker from sharing product details on its Instagram account to grow its sales. Campaigners welcomed the impending climbdown which would also have stopped pubs struggling with Covid from putting menus on social media. The Adam Smith Institute said: ""It's right the Government has realised the plan to ban online ads for Great Britain's food heroes was well and truly mad. ""It's a commonsense victory for every local bakery, coffee shop, pub, chippy and curry house."" WHAT took the Government so long to scrap the ludicrous proposed ban on online ads for fast food? The scientific evidence showed it would cut a child's daily calories by about two . . . that's a biscuit crumb. All at a monstrous cost to businesses. The Sun pointed this out last November. It shows the power of the nanny-state lobby that this mad idea wasn't immediately laughed out of the room. But we welcome No10 seeing the light now. How about applying the same common sense to other failed measures? Like the sugar tax, which won't trim an ounce off anyone's weight. Then concentrate on the real solutions: Better education on diet — and exercise."
296,296,The Sun,Jonathan ReillyHarry ColeKate Ferguson,The 3 ways you’ll get a Covid ‘freedom pass’ to go to the pub,"BRITS could have three ways of getting a Covid ""freedom pass"" to go to the pub. Past infection, proof of a jab or a recent negative test recorded on a smartphone app would give the green light. Those who have had Covid will be able to show proof of their immunity from the bug on the NHS app to claim their pass even if they have not been jabbed. Prime Minister Boris Johnson revealed yesterday that evidence of antibodies in the blood could be enough to qualify for the certificates for pubs, restaurants, cinemas, stadiums and theatres. It follows Wednesday's bombshell admission that pubs will be able to use vaccine passports to block un-jabbed drinkers. A review into how it will work will be published early next month, with current plans looking at using the NHS app as a digital freedom pass. A paper version will be handed out to those without smartphones. It comes as: Individual businesses will be able to ignore the scheme — but those that take it up look set to be allowed to relax social distancing in their premises and pack in more punters. Meanwhile, pubs could reportedly ask punters to show a blood test in order to prove they are Covid immune for a pint. Ministers are said to be considering Covid 'status checks' as a way of helping bars and other big venues to scrap social distancing rules. People could be required to take an antibody test to prove they have had the bug - which involves taking a sample of their blood for analysis. The PM said that the review into how Covid certificates could work will be published in as little as ten days' time. WHAT must I do to go to the pub? You must prove you've had the jab, a natural immunity, or a recent negative test. HOW will I prove my status? The Government wants to add certificates to the NHS App, with a physical version for non-smartphone users. WILL I have to social distance? Not if you have the certificate. WHAT if I've had no jab, don't have antibodies or want a test? You can go to pubs, bars or venues with social distancing. WILL I need one to sit in a beer garden on April 12? No, these measures don't affect the reopening then. But he promised its findings would not delay the reopening of beer gardens on April 12. Boris acknowledged the ""moral complexities"" around a domestic vaccine passport scheme and suggested that it might only be possible to introduce one after all adults had been offered a jab at the end of July. He said: ""The libertarian in me is also trying to protect people's fundamental right to life and their ability to live their lives normally. ""And the only way really to restore that for everybody is for us to beat the disease and the best path to freedom is down the cautious but irreversible road map that we've set out — that's what the freedom-lover wants."" But the scheme is likely to be hugely controversial and spark massive opposition from civil liberties campaigners, some Tory MPs and many businesses. Last night, one Tory claimed drinkers who choose the negative tests option would need to take two over three days to enjoy 24 hours of freedom. Steve Baker blasted the need to take them to enjoy the same liberties for a single day as those jabbed or with natural immunity. He added: ""That is a pretty despicable way to live. It's a way to live from which I recoil in absolute horror, applying to the Government for 24 hours of freedom after a couple of tests."" The best path to freedom is down the cautious but irreversible road map that we've set out. Britain has more than 30million 15-minute pin-prick kits to test antibodies in the blood — evidence of previous infection — ready to be rolled out this summer. Michael Gove's review into how the scheme would work is looking at using stock which has been languishing in warehouses over the past year. The Cabinet heavyweight told MPs yesterday: ""My view on this issue is consistent — that a system that relied purely on vaccination would not be appropriate. ""But what would be right was a system that ensured that we could open up our economy to the maximum extent that takes account both of vaccine status, but also of recent test status and indeed potentially also antibody status as well."" The PM added: ""There are three basic components — the vaccine, your immunity that you might have after you've had Covid, and then there's testing. ""So there are three things that could work together. No decisions have been taken at all."" More details of the vaccine certificate will be unveiled in the first two weeks of April but it is not expected to come into force straight away. Meanwhile, controversial laws which extend the Government's lockdown powers for another six months sailed through the Commons last night despite a Tory backbench revolt. MPs voted by 484 to 76. Some 35 Tories united with dozens from Labour to rebel against the law. In a fiery showdown, lockdown- hating Conservatives said the draconian powers should be ditched now Covid rates are falling. One, Sir Desmond Swayne, warned: ""After months of denial, now indeed it will be the case that you will have to provide your vaccination bona fides when you go to the pub. ""And those people who are teetotal imagining that they might be spared that intrusion and inconvenience can dream on, because undoubtedly this will be extended to restaurants, theatres, sporting venues and so proceeding to total social control."" In a wacky intervention, another Tory MP Sir Charles Walker vowed to go on a bizarre one-man protest with a pint of milk to vent his fury. A review is also looking at social distancing measures. The plans to end lockdown implied that these would be lifted in June in England but government sources were rowing back on that commitment."
297,297,The Sun,Nick GutteridgeHarry ColeMark Hodge,Desperate EU chief says Brussels may STILL block AstraZeneca vaccine exports to UK until they ‘catch up’ on vaccines,"URSULA von der Leyen has warned Brussels may still stop AstraZeneca exports to the UK after EU leaders snubbed her barmy jabs blockade. The crisis-hit EU chief last night threatened to halt deliveries to Britain until AZ ""catches up"" on shipments to the Continent. The bizarre move came hours after bloc leaders decided to take vaccine embargoes off the table and snubbed the Commission President's bold bid to restrict shipments to Britain. Mrs von der Leyen - backed by France, Spain, Italy, and Austria - begged them to issue a statement of support for the plan. Instead the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany pushed back against it and added in wording emphasising the need to keep supply chains open. Eurocrats had told EU capitals that Britain needs supplies from the bloc to provide millions of people with second doses. During the summit Mrs von der Leyen even brandished a world map showing how more than a quarter of all the shots leaving Europe have come our way. Eurocrats said the EU has exported 21m jabs to the UK since the start of the year - 20m of them Pfizer and a million AstraZeneca. A source said: ""The Commission probably hoped for universal acclaim. But they weren't going to get that, so it was better just to have no language at all."" Ireland, the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Sweden, and Spain are all against the export ban. Germany has also watered down its support over fears of sparking a vaccine war with Britain. But last night Mrs Von Der Leyen furiously hit out at AstraZeneca after it delayed its jab deliveries and threatened to stop exports if contracts were not honoured. She said: ""Companies have to honour their contract to the European Union before they export to other regions in the world. ""And this is of course the case with AstraZeneca"" She added: ""We could have been much faster if all pharmaceutical companies had fulfilled their contracts. ""AstraZenaca has committed to a lower number of doses than was contracted."" As the EU's rollout stutters, Britain has vaccinated nearly 30 million people. Today housing secretary Rob Jenrick warned any move by Brussels to restrict exports to Britain would be ""very damaging"". He said: ""We've got to work together and cooperate to ensure we can get the vaccine and have a win-win situation for both the UK and the EU. ""Vaccines are based on complex international supply chains. There are elements of the vaccines being produced in the UK, elements produced in parts of the EU. ""It's critical for all countries there are free flow of medical products, including vaccines across, international borders. ""It would be very damaging if countries started to pull up drawbridges and prevent vaccines, medicines, or elements of them crossing international borders and the UK strongly strongly opposes that."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock insisted the UK's ""exclusive"" contract with AstraZeneca - which obliges the firm to deliver doses to Britain first - was better than the EU's. He told the FT: ""I believe that free trading nations follow the law of contracts. ""They have a 'best efforts' contract and we have an exclusivity deal."" Emmanuel Macron could not resist blasting the UK over its policy of not exporting vaccines to the bloc during the early stages of its rollout. He said: ""Europe is not a selfish continent. Because when I read what the press on the other side of the Channel writes, we're being accused of being selfish. ""Wrong. We let our supply chains untouched. ""But we saw that the United States tend to protect their own vaccine production … that the United Kingdom did not export many doses. ""Actually, none. So we put in place an export control mechanism."" Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel said she wanted a ""win-win"" situation with Britain, adding she wanted to act ""sensibly politically."" While the Dutch PM Mark Rutte said: ""We are friends, us and the UK, and we need each other."" And he warned production Pfizer's factory in Belgium would be badly hit by tit-for-tat conflict with Britain. He expressed hopes the UK and Brussels can do a deal at the weekend ""in the spirit of win win"", adding: ""A landing spot is possible here."" Earlier old EU boss Jean-Claude Juncker hit out: ""Nobody understands why we're witnessing such a stupid vaccine war."" And one EU diplomat said: ""This would never have happened on Juncker's watch. ""He would have sat everyone down to talk it over, and not just hit the nuclear button straight away."" Brussels' beefed up export ban targeting Britain is already in force because eurocrats have power over trade policy. But sources said it is effectively dead on arrival, such is the opposition within Member States to using the new powers. Capitals were angered by Mrs von der Leyen's attempts to ""bounce"" them into accepting the policy by announcing it the day before their summit. Belgium and the Netherlands both declared that a deal with the UK to avoid an export ban could be sealed as soon as the weekend. Negotiations are focussing on how to divvy up production at an AZ plant in the Netherlands capable of churning out 5m doses a month. Brussels sources said the chances of agreement had been helped by the fact the firm is now also falling short on its contract with Britain. One diplomat told The Sun: ""By selling the same supply twice they've imperilled the second jab in the UK and imperilled the first jab in the EU. ""That's caused a sea change in the Brits' attitude - we're seeing they've now realised we're in this boat together. ""There seems to be a common understanding of the problem. So we hope European diplomacy on all fronts with prevail."" Meanwhile, millions of AstraZeneca vaccines are sitting unused across Europe amid a sluggish rollout across the bloc. According to European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control figures there are currently around 5.5 million unused doses of the jab sitting in warehouses. Germany has received 3.4 million doses of the vaccine but has administered 1.9 million, while France has taken delivery of 2.8 million but only around given out 1.5 million."
298,298,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Baffling ‘stay alert’ slogan ditched for when ‘stay at home’ order is lifted next week,"LAST year's much-mocked ""stay alert"" slogan will not return when we stop being told to ""stay at home"" next week, The Sun can reveal. Instead ministers have signed off a new ""let's take this next step safely"" slogan on adverts encouraging people to stay outside instead and get as much fresh air as possible. When lockdown began to be eased last May, the very effective slogan ""Stay home, protect the NHS, save lives"" was replaced by the confusing ""Stay alert, control the virus, save lives"". But people complained it was meaningless and even dangerously muddled. It comes as: Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth said last year: ""People will be looking slightly puzzled, questioning 'What does it mean to stay alert? What are the Government saying with that?'"" Boris Johnson ordered everyone to stay at home once again in January, but 29 March sees a slow return to freedoms. The next stage of the lockdown easing roadmap will see a return of the rule of six or two households able to mix in outdoors and in gardens. With the prospect of BBQs in gardens and picnics in parks this Easter bank holiday weekend, a TV and radio advertising blitz has been scheduled to remind people its outdoors only. Advertising industry insiders who have seen the plans told The Sun: ""The focus is on fresh air. Stay alert has gone and instead it's all about stay outside."""
299,299,The Sun,Harry ColeNick GutteridgeNick McDermottNatasha Clark,Brussels BACKS DOWN in Covid jabs war and vows to work with UK after Boris warned blockade would destroy EU’s reputation,"BRUSSELS blinked last night over threats to ban exports of jabs to Britain after the PM warned its global reputation would be in tatters. Crisis talks ended with both sides vowing to work together on a ""win-win situation"" after days of EU mayhem-making. The bloc is livid with AstraZeneca for providing jabs made in Europe to Britain, but the pharma giant says it is duty-bound because the UK got in first. The row blew up over vaccines made at an AZ plant in the Netherlands, which can churn out up to five million vials a month. Eurocrats argued they should get almost all of them because their rollout is going much worse than Britain — which was last night also facing an export ban from India. Brussels announced moves yesterday morning to restrict exports to countries vaccinating faster than the bloc — a threat clearly aimed at the UK. The EU also ordered a raid on a factory in Italy amid suspicions AZ was hoarding jabs bound for Britain. But it turned out the 29million doses at the facility near Rome were actually destined for Belgium. Brussels complains it has exported ten million doses to Britain without receiving any in reply. It says the UK's contract with AZ, which gives us first dibs, amounts to a ""de facto export ban"". But a climbdown came after Boris Johnson issued a stark warning to Brussels of considerable ""long-term damage"" to its reputation and investment hopes if it threw up barriers. The PM hit out: ""Vaccines are the product of international co-operation. ""I don't think blockades of either vaccines or of ingredients for vaccines are sensible, and I think that the long-term damage done by blockades can be very considerable."" He told a Commons committee: ""Companies may look at such actions and draw conclusions about whether or not it is sensible to make future investments in countries where arbitrary blockades are imposed."" In follow-up calls to chief Eurocrat Ursula von der Leyen, he stressed the risk a vaccine war would pose to supply chains. Germany's Angela Merkel also urged Brussels to back away from threats to block Pfizer jabs headed for the UK as ingredients are made in Britain and could be blocked in retaliation. Senior German MEP Bernd Lange, chairman of the European Parliament trade committee, also warned such a ban would mean ""less vaccines for the EU"". He said: ""The Commission brings out the shotgun, but we may end up shooting ourselves in the foot. ""In the end we will mostly have losers and only one winner — the virus itself."" In a joint statement issued last night, No 10 and the EU said: ""We have been discussing what more we can do to ensure a reciprocally beneficial relationship between the UK and EU of Covid-19. ""We are working on specific steps we can take in the short, medium and long term to create a win-win situation and expand vaccine supply for all our citizens."" An EU source said: ""A win-win means both the UK and EU should share in getting less than anticipated. ""This is what is under discussion. We have to strike an agreement there and I really hope we can manage."" But last night it emerged the UK is also facing a shortfall in deliveries because India is blocking key shipments. Five million Oxford/AstraZeneca doses were due to arrive from there next week. But the shipment has been delayed by a month, with PM Narendra Modi's government blamed. With infections rising, the Serum Institute of India — the world's biggest vaccine-maker — has been ordered to focus on domestic demand. One source told news agency Reuters: ""Everything else has taken a back seat, for the time being at least."" Analysis by Nick McDermott THE UK has eight different Covid vaccines totalling 457million jabs on order and ministers have urged Brits not to worry about supplies. The vaccine programme is ahead of schedule, with 54 per cent of adults already jabbed. While EU sabre-rattling on vaccine exports may sound alarming, the wheels are not about to come off our record-breaking rollout. Britain's reliance on our closest neighbours is limited. Oxford/AstraZeneca is the most used in the UK and there are 100million doses on order, with the vast majority being made here. There is also a contract for 40million doses of the Pfizer jab from Belgium. The majority of that order has already been used or has arrived here and we could get more shots from outside the EU if necessary. So for the UK and our army of NHS vaccinators, it's a case of keep calm and carry on jabbing. As a result, most Brits in their 40s will have to wait until May to get their first dose. The NHS will instead shift its focus to second jabs for the most vulnerable next month. Last night officials said the UK remains on course to meet its target of immunising the over-50s by mid-April and all adults by late July."

""We will put all options on the table in terms of working with third countries, and countries like Denmark already exploring options like this. ""And we will continue to explore bilaterally options in terms of returning and removing people that have come to the UK illegally."" Gibraltar's government had reacted with fury to the suggestion it could be used to process asylum seekers. Mr Picardo had urged the Home Secretary to reject such ""groundless speculation"". And he insisted the Rock, which is a self-governed British Overseas Territory, has total control of its own border policy. In a letter to Mrs Patel he wrote: ""Gibraltar is always ready to help the UK as part of the British family of nations.

302,302,The Sun,Kate FergusonHarry Cole,Boris Johnson risks fresh vaccine row over UK’s ‘greedy’ jab firms,"BORIS Johnson risked inflaming the EU vaccines war last night by saying ""it was greed my friends"" behind ""our vaccine success"". The PM made the controversial comments in a private address to Tory MPs over Zoom earlier in the evening. He was hailing the efforts of ""big pharma"" in manufacturing the life-saving jab in lightning-quick time. Boris has spent days trying to dial down the rhetoric and pleading with European leaders to abandon their threat to slap an export ban on vaccines. But he risked reigniting tensions with the continent last night as he boasted about how Britain stole the march. He told MPs at the 1922 Committee: ""The reason we have the vaccine success is because of capitalism, because of greed my friends."" He later added: ""Actually I regret saying it."" And he asked MPs repeatedly to ""forget I said that"". It comes as: Sources say Mr Johnson singled out that AstraZenca were producing the vaccine at cost and thanked them for their brilliant work. They also insist the PM was not discussing the ongoing row with Europe over jabs, but instead talking about the wider scientific endeavour. Witnesses say the comments came as he hailed pharma giants for producing the jabs, adding: ""It was giant corporations that wanted to give good returns to shareholders."" He added: ""It was driven by big pharma - and I don't just mean the Chief Whip."" The PM's enforcer Mark Spencer was previously a farmer. In his end of term address to Tory backbenchers, he also delighted them by savaging Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer. He swiped: ""You can take the lawyer out of Islington but you can't take Islington out of the lawyer."" We don't believe in blockades of any kind of vaccines or vaccine materials. That's not something this country would dream of engaging in."" He also took aim at the BBC claiming there are ""moments where they approach fairness"" adding there is a ""degree of instinctive metropolitan bias in the BBC newsroom"". He added: ""It's pretty clear from the whole Brexit experience that the BBC was pretty detached from a lot of its viewers and listeners and I hope they move more into line"" with their viewers. EU leaders have explosively threatened to block life-saving vaccine doses which are meant to be heading for Britain. The chilling threat sparked fears of a global vaccine trade war and warnings Britain would be forced to block the export of key ingredients used in the Pfizer jab. But after weeks of angry attacks, Britain and Germany appeared to be inching towards a compromise yesterday afternoon. The PM told the No10 press conference last night: ""We don't believe in blockades of any kind of vaccines or vaccine materials. That's not something this country would dream of engaging in. ""We'll continue to work with European partners to deliver the vaccine rollout."" Boris said he was ""encouraged"" by the attitude of EU capitals towards finding a solution. And he didn't rule out sharing jabs from an AstraZeneca plant in the Netherlands. German chief Angela Merkel offered an olive branch by saying she opposes a ""general export ban"" targeting Britain. But she backed a targeted crackdown on AZ jabs which were earmarked for Britain."
303,303,The Sun,Harry ColeNick McDermottNick Gutteridge,Boris Johnson vows to end lockdown ‘once and for all’  on anniversary of country first shutting down,"BORIS Johnson yesterday vowed to end lockdown ""once and for all"" ahead of today's first anniversary. The PM warned a third Covid wave in Europe would ""wash up on our shores"", but hailed our jabs success and national spirit. He also called for calm amid barmy EU threats of a vaccine export ban on the UK. The PM personally phoned Brussels leaders to urge them to dial down the rhetoric in the supply row. As the EU splintered over whether to seize AstraZeneca doses coming to the UK, ministers privately warned they would have no choice but to retaliate on jab ingredients flowing to the continent. Boris declared he could ""bash on"" with his route to freedom thanks to our jabs success. But the stakes could not be higher, with Mr Johnson issuing a stark warning last night of the third wave sweeping the continent. The PM told reporters: ""Previous experience has taught us that when a wave hits our friends, I'm afraid it washes up on our shores as well and expect we will feel those effects in due course."" Mr Johnson will join a minute's silence today in tribute to the 125,000 lost to the virus. Last year was ""one of the most difficult"" in the history of Britain, the PM said as the nation prepared to stand still at noon to remember the dead. Church bells will then chime and iconic landmarks will be lit up at 8pm across the UK in tribute. The movement, spearheaded by Marie Curie and the Together Coalition, will bring together 200 organisations from across the country to ""mourn as a nation"". The PM added: ""We should also remember the great spirit shown by our nation over this past year. ""We have all played our part, whether it's working on the front line as a nurse or carer, working on vaccine development and supply, helping to get that jab into arms, home schooling your children, or just by staying at home to prevent the spread of the virus. ""It's because of every person in this country that lives have been saved, our NHS was protected, and we have started on our cautious road to easing restrictions once and for all."" We should also remember the great spirit shown by our nation over this past year. Meanwhile, he spent yesterday and Sunday attempting to calm tensions with Brussels after the EU doubled down on commission president Ursula von der Leyen's jabs blockade threat amid its own bungled plans. In a coded threat Britain could retaliate, he insisted the vaccines ""require international co-operation"". But last night, he said: ""I am reassured by talking to EU partners over the last few months that they don't want to see blockades, and that is very, very important."" And in a positive development for No10, AstraZeneca claimed that Britain was not reliant on Europe for delivery of its 100 million order of Oxford Covid jabs. The pharma giant said the vast majority of its UK doses are being manufactured in Britain. Bosses said only one vaccine batch, reportedly enough to bottle several million doses, was expected to arrive from the Holland site. The UK also has a contract for 40 million doses of the Pfizer jab, which is made in Belgium. But officials say the majority of the order has already been jabbed into Brits' arms or has arrived in the country. Former England football star Gary Pallister, 55, was seen getting his jab in Middlesbrough yesterday as Britain's vaccine plans were still very much alive and kicking. And the PM insisted: ""We will just bash on with the roadmap we set out, with the programme we've got."" Privately, ministers admit that the UK would have ""no choice"" but to block vaccine ingredient exports to the continent if the EU triggers a full-blown jab export ban as threatened. One told The Sun ""the British public would not put up"" with anything else. BORIS Johnson is trying to be diplomatic in the face of deranged EU provocation. Good luck with that, PM. But we fear it will not suffice to take the moral high ground and be more statesmanlike than the clowns in Brussels and the capitals of Europe. If they block vital vaccines reaching us, we must retaliate to persuade them to change course. Even by holding their Pfizer jab ingredients at the UK factory. Give Northern Ireland border checks the boot for the foreseeable too. The PM's warmth towards our ""European friends and allies"" is a triumph of hope over experience. Their habitual aggression from the instant we voted Leave in 2016 has erupted into naked hostility more redolent of a rogue state. Consider the EU's insane position. A huge US study now says the Oxford AstraZeneca jab is totally safe and near-miraculous in its protective powers. But EU leaders, terrified by Brexit Britain's vaccine success, have already falsely convinced millions it's a dud. So millions of vials sit untouched in EU fridges. But they are hell-bent on securing more, demanding AstraZeneca breaks its watertight UK contract to supply them instead. These are life-saving drugs we part-funded and ordered from a private company. The EU knows it has no legal right to them. It aims to steal them, even to block ALL jab exports to Britain. Why deprive a neighbouring country of a vaccine you do not intend to use? For one reason only: To handicap our rollout, even though more Brits will die. The EU's Brexit derangement may last years. Much sooner, its misled citizens will note our soaring Oxford jab totals and plummeting Covid deaths and wonder if, just maybe, the two are linked. For the time being Britain must re- focus, and concentrate our trade, on our true friends around the world. And if Brussels begins its blockade, the pain should reluctantly be reciprocated. But there were some signs Mr Johnson's efforts were working as a noisy rebellion from other countries over the export ban plan grew. Irish PM Micheal Martin said it risks other countries blocking vital supplies to Europe. An EU official added that Britain was ""not to blame"" for the stand-off with AstraZeneca over vaccine supplies."
304,304,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor","Boris Johnson was ‘naive’ to give Nicola Sturgeon pandemic powers, Cabinet colleagues claim","BORIS Johnson should have used sweeping civil contingencies powers to cut out Nicola Sturgeon from the Covid response, Cabinet colleagues claim. And a year on, some around the top table say the PM regrets his decision not to do so. Ahead of Tuesday's anniversary of the first Lockdown, The Sun can reveal a major rift at the top of government last March over how to respond to the emerging pandemic. The PM was urged by some ministers and aides not to use 1980s Public Health laws to respond - as Health matters are devolved meaning Edinburgh and Cardiff  were given the chance to go their own way in response. Instead they wanted Mr Johnson to rely on the doomsday 2004 Civil Contingencies Act which gave Whitehall supreme authority for a ""catastrophic emergency"". Insiders say the issue was raised multiple times at Cobra and around the Cabinet table. At one tense early meeting it is understood Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg was particularly vocal at using the sweeping Act rather than writing a new law for Covid that sat alongside the 1984 Public Health Act. However Downing Street were said to be concerned that extreme Civil Contingencies powers would have to be approved by MPs every 30 days, whereas writing a new law gave them emergency control for a whole year. Mr Johnson opted for the special Coronavirus Act 2020 instead that also gave the police massive powers, suspended elections and paved the way for the furlough scheme. But insiders say they were blindsided by the fragmented response to the bug across the four nations of the United Kingdom. Scotland and Wales have been able to set their own lockdown measures and easing timetables as a result - at times creating tension with Westminster. The Scottish first minister has been openly critical of the UK government's response for England, infuriating Whitehall. Not only did the decision lead to confusing different rules for different parts of country,  it also saw Nicola Sturgeon's poll ratings rocket. A former aide who has now left government told The Sun: ""At the time I think everyone just assumed there would be a joined up response across the whole country and we didn't really think at the time it would splinter. ""But obviously that turned out to be wrong and was pretty naive."" ""I have no doubt that it will be done differently next time. The PM knows that."" A Cabinet Minister said: ""I have no doubt that it will be done differently next time. The PM knows that."" Others around the Cabinet table agree, but another added that ""hindsight is a wonderful thing."" They insisted: ""It was bonkers back then so no one is to blame."" Asked if Mr Johnson had any regrets, Downing Street insisted that their customised Covid law was needed as their response to the crisis was so broad. A Government spokesperson said: ""Without the Coronavirus Act, the most crucial support and interventions such as the furlough scheme and people claiming Statutory Sick Pay and other benefits would not have been able to continue during the pandemic, as well as other public services including virtual court hearings."" The added: ""It has also provided important parliamentary scrutiny""."
305,305,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Child rapists and terrorists will be stopped from using exploiting modern slavery loophole to stay in Britain,"CHILD rapists, terrorists and serious criminals as well as failed asylum seekers will be stopped from exploiting modern slavery safeguards to stay in Britain. And lefty lawyers who help them face a major clampdown and punishing costs for wasting court time. Asylum appeals will be ""expedited"" too to stop delays in deportations. The landmark Modern Slavery Act was designed in 2014 to protect vulnerable people being trafficked but is regularly used without merit to delay the expulsion from the UK of serious criminals. The number of people claiming to have suffered it has doubled since 2017 and 2020 from 5,141 to 10,613. Home Secretary Priti Patel tells The Sun today criminals and terrorists are ""diverting resources away from genuine victims of trafficking, persecution and serious harm – which is completely unacceptable."" Upcoming reforms to the asylum system due to be unveiled on Wednesday will stop deportees being able to frustrate their removal using Modern Slavery laws. And its protection is to be withheld from dangerous criminals who have received prison sentences of over a year, as well as individuals who pose a threat to national security. The reforms will also tackle spurious last minute legal challenges to pull illegal immigrants off deportation planes. The Home Office wants to use the new Sovereign Borders Bill to target ""dinghy-chasing"" firms with strict rules similar to the Fixed Recovery Costs faced by  accident lawyers. Instead of long haggles over costs for cases, there will be a flat fee for unsuccessful bids. And judges will have the power to slap massive costs on have-a-go lawyers who use template papers and every excuse they can think of to try to stop deportations without merit. They will have to sign up to a ""good faith"" agreement promising not to use false or jumped up excuses not to expel failed asylum seekers. If they breach it they face newly toughened ""Wasted Costs Orders"". A government source said last night: ""Cases will be heard fairly, they just won't be heard over and over again. ""Some of the tactics some law firms use to keep people with no right to be here in the country are scandalous and we want to make sure they, not taxpayers pick up the bills."" The Home Secretary told The Sun: ""Our generous safeguards for victims are being rampantly abused by child rapists, people who pose a threat to national security and failed asylum seekers with no right to be here. ""The UK has led the world in protecting the victims of modern slavery and we will continue to support those who have suffered intolerable abuse at the hands of criminals and traffickers so they can rebuild their lives."""

Dr Paul Williams also said he was ""sorry"" for tweeting about his fondness for ""Tory MILFS"". In 2011 he compared then defence secretary Liam Fox to infamous ""Uncle Monty"" in the hit 80s film Withnail and I. The character attempts to force himself on a young man. At the time Dr Fox was under fire over claims he had misled the press about a burglary at his flat. Dr Williams tweeted: ""Am I the only one to read the sentence containing Liam Fox, burglary and young man in spare room to think of a scene in Withnail and I?"" In another tweet that year he asked his followers ""do you have a favourite Tory MILF?"" The acronym is slang for an attractive older woman. Today he told The Sun: ""These tweets were inappropriate and I am sorry for using such language. ""They were from a decade ago, which doesn't diminish the fact that they were wrong, but I want to reassure people that I wouldn't dream of making comments like this now."" The Hartlepool by-election has been sparked by the resignation of Mike Hill, who quit amid allegations of sexual harassment. Dr Williams was MP for Stockton South from 2017 until 2019, when he lost his seat as the Red Wall was swept away in Boris Johnson's landslide victory. Asked if use of the word 'MILF' was appropriate during a visit to Glasgow, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""No it isn't and Hartlepool is obviously a very important by-election for us."" The by-election is seen as a key test of Sir Keir's leadership as he seeks to defend a seat in Labour's heartlands, with so much of it falling to the Conservatives in the 2019 general election."
307,307,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha Clark,Nicola Sturgeon brushes off bombshell report as MSPs say ‘hard to believe’ she didn’t know concerns over Alex Salmond,"NICOLA Sturgeon last night brushed off a bombshell report which found she had misled the Scots Parliament - who also claimed it was ""hard to believe"" she didn't know about Alex Salmond's allegations. The Scottish First Minister is today facing mounting calls to resign over her war with the former Scottish boss, after a committee ruled that she was not truthful in her evidence given to them. And this lunchtime she skipped the daily Covid briefing and left it to the experts as she dodged questions over the latest twist in the long-running saga. Heaping pressure on Ms Sturgeon to quit, they found she misled the committee itself and therefore misled parliament and potentially breached the ministerial code of conduct. But it's likely she will try to avoid having to resign because it does not accuse of her of being ""knowingly dishonest"". Last night she tried to brush off the blow, saying she HAD been honest in her mammoth eight-hour committee session earlier on - and blames opposition politicians for playing party politics. On Thursday evening, she told Sky News: ""I stand by all of the evidence I gave to the committee, all eight hours' worth of evidence. ""What's been clear is that opposition members of this committee made their minds up about me before I uttered a single word of evidence, their public comments have made that clear. ""So this leak from the committee - very partisan leak - tonight before they've finalised the report is not that surprising."" A spokesman for the First Minister said: ""The First Minister told the truth to the committee in eight hours of evidence, and stands by that evidence. ""The question of the First Minister's adherence to the ministerial code is being considered independently by James Hamilton, and we expect to receive and publish his report soon."" A Scottish Parliament spokeswoman said the committee - which has four SNP members and five from other parties - is still considering its report. Former first ministers have quit over far smaller incidents of breaching the rule book but Ms Sturgeon will try to tough out the row. But this morning more revelations from the yet-to-be-released report came out, with members saying they found it ""hard to believe"" she didn't know about what was alleged to be going on before November 2017. Sky News revealed that the committee believes Ms Sturgeon should have acted upon any information about her predecessor's conduct. It also revealed the Committee on the Scottish Government Handling of Harassment Complaints is ""concerned"" about meetings between Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon - and why it took so long to tell Scotland's civil service about what she knew. A No10 spokesperson refused to be drawn on whether the PM thought the matters were concerning Downing Street said this lunchtime: ""I understand that the committee's report will be published next week. ""These are rightly matters for the Scottish Parliament to consider. You'll be aware of the PM's comments in relation to that yesterday at the press conference."" The members on the committee voted along party lines - with SNP MPs backing the First Minister, and opposition ones voting against. The findings are a major embarrassment for the Scottish National Party leader on the eve of crucial Scottish Parliament elections. The Tories and Labour both say that in misleading parliament, she has breached the ministerial code of conduct. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said this morning: ""If it does conclude that the First Minister has misled Parliament and potentially breached the ministerial code then that is incredibly serious. ""This is about the integrity of our Scottish Parliament and upholding standards in public life."" And former Tory boss Ruth Davidson piled in too on the calls for her to quit. She told TimesRadio: ""Nicola Sturgeon has been a part of the furniture of the Scottish parliament for 22 years now. She knows the rules. In fact, her picture and her signature is written on the cover sheet of the rules and if she's broken the rules then she has to go."" Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross added last night: ""We cannot set a precedent that a First Minister of Scotland can mislead the Scottish Parliament and get away with it,"" he said. ""We have to trust that the First Minister will be truthful. We no longer can."" She appeared before the committee last month giving evidence in both writing and in person claiming she had not offered to intervene in a harassment probe into alleged bad behaviour by her predecessor Mr Salmond. But he blew that claim out of the water by testifying the opposite, and was backed up by his legal team who were present at meetings with Sturgeon. Duncan Hamilton QC, his legal adviser said he heard Sturgeon tell Salmond in 2018: ""If it comes to it, I will intervene."" The report is expected to be formally published next week but its key finding was leaked last night. It comes after senior Tory MP David Davis claimed a top aide knew about the allegations two months before the First Minister claimed she found out. Mr Davis said he knew of messages between top civil servants from February 2018 which suggested Ms Sturgeon's chief of staff Liz Lloyd had ""interfered"" in the internal investigation of Mr Salmond. He also said a whistleblower passed him messages between senior SNP officials, including Mrs Sturgeon's husband Peter Murrell. Mr Davis said those messages suggest a ""concerted effort"" to encourage complaints about Mr Salmond. Mr Davis used parliamentary privilege to reveal leaked messages which he said show there was a ""concerted effort by senior members of the SNP to encourage complaints"" against Mr Salmond."
308,308,The Sun,Nick GutteridgeHarry Cole,Brits set to be packed back into football stadiums and theatres from June 21 with proof of a negative test or Covid jab,"BRITS who can provide proof of a Covid vaccination or negative test could be packed back into football stadiums, cinemas and theatres from June 21, the Culture Secretary declared today. Oliver Dowden said ministers are working up plans for ""Covid certificates"" that would allow venues to let in big crowds and largely do away with social distancing measures to ""get people back in significant numbers"". It comes after he told The Sun that Wembley will be stuffed with ""as many people as we can"" for the Euros final. The new Covid certificates would be combined with other measures like one-way systems for fans, mask wearing, and frequent hand sanitising to help make mass events coronavirus secure. They will be piloted indoors at the World Snooker Championship at Sheffield's legendary Crucible on April 17, and then outdoors too during the FA Cup final on May 15 at Wembley. Mr Dowden said: ""We've set out a really ambitious roadmap which we're working very hard to deliver on. ""If all goes well and vaccination remains on track as it is, and we keep the disease under control, by May 17 we'll be back to the sort of things we saw last summer, so socially distanced performances indoor and outdoor. ""And the the big step forwards will be on June 21, which is the point at which we want to get as much back as we possibly can. I'm working really intensively on the safest way to do that. ""We're looking at how we can ensure in indoor and outdoor settings, how we can get as many people back as we possibly can and get back to the things we really love as a nation."" Mr Dowden insisted the new Covid certificates won't be the same as vaccine passports, in that they won't discriminate against people who haven't had the jab, and said no ""final decisions have been taken"" on how they'll work. He said: ""We've been clear that there won't be a vaccine passport. The PM has made that very clear. ""What we have said though is in order to prove for example that you've had a vaccine or that you've had a successful negative test, we're looking at ways to help facilitate proving that, and that may be one of the things that could help ensure we get more people back into stadiums."" The culture secretary also said he fears for the future of many businesses in the sports and entertainment sectors if the Government doesn't manage to get them fully open again in the next few months. He said: ""If we don't manage to do it this summer, if we succeed with the vaccine rollout, if we succeed with getting the disease under control, I'm really worried about the future of those industries that are so vital not just to our sense of wellbeing but to the whole national economy. ""I hope we will be able to find ways against having the sort of social distancing we have at the moment because that makes is very, very difficult for theatre productions to be run properly. ""It makes it very, very difficult for our football clubs to run profitably if you have to have those large distances between people. ""We are proceeding with caution, that's why we're piloting different ways of mitigating against that and one of the things we're considering as part of that is Covid certification."" In an interview with The Sun, Mr Dowden reiterated that Britain stands ready to host more European Championship matches and is waiting for organiser UEFA's call. The football tournament's semi-finals and final are already pencilled in for Wembley in July with other other matches spread over Europe. But thanks to the UK's gangbusters vaccine rollout and soaring Covid cases on the Continent, Britain is offering to host more games. In an interview with The Sun, Mr Dowden said: ""We are working to make sure we can get as many people as we can into the final and the semis and deal with all the other challenges around that. In terms of going further than that we stand ready, but its really for them to come to us."" Trials start next month to allow fans back in stadiums ahead of a hoped for easing of restrictions in time of July's spectacle and other summer highlights like Wimbledon and Lords cricket. Mr Dowden says his number one short term goal is ""getting bums on seats"" and is working with Michael Gove on vaccine passports to make it happen. He added that he is ""working well with UEFA"" and using ""Covid certification to make it more viable for those events to go ahead with less or no social distancing. ""I'm pushing everything"" to get ""the kind of opening up we have not seen since before Covid hit."" And he says he is  ""pretty confident we will get to that point"" with things ""as close to normality as we can"" by July if the vaccine stays on track and cases keep coming down."
309,309,The Sun,Jerome StarkeyHarry Cole,Britain will ‘exact a price’ from enemies who dare attack us including Russia and China,"BRITAIN will ""exact a price"" from enemies who attack us — including Russia and China. Top brass issued the blunt warning as they revealed RAF planes in Cyprus are being jammed by Russian technology. The daily attacks interfere with aircraft navigation systems — but our Top Guns are still flying. Sources slammed the Cyprus attacks as ""reckless use of military capability"". A squadron of eight Typhoons are based at RAF Akrotiri for missions against Isis in Syria and Iraq. The aircraft being attacked include A400M transport planes on routine resupply flights. ""There are only about two countries that would jam us in that part of the world. It's only Russia or Syria,"" the source added. ""The people doing the jamming are at a state level."" Russia has a naval base at Tartus in Syria, which is 100 miles east of Cyprus. Russia's subs patrol the eastern Med and Moscow has installed cutting edge missile defence systems to protect its butcher ally in Damascus, President Bashar Al Assad. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: ""The line between conflict and peace has become increasingly blurred."" He is set to unveil new weapons as he cuts the Army by 10,000 troops and axes tanks to fund kit to fight future wars. He added: ""We're modernising the armed forces to ensure we're ready to fight the wars of today and tomorrow"". A new Special Forces cyber unit will fight alongside the SAS and SBS as Britain becomes more aggressive in defending its interests. The MoD's top spy chief, Lt Gen Jim Hockenhull, said future battles ""will not be defined by lines on a map or geography"". He said hostile states, terrorists and proxies will attack us above and below the threshold of war. Defence officials said Russia was constantly probing the UK, by sending ships, subs and aircraft towards our territory. ""We need to do more of that back,"" one said. Britain has a ""range of tools"" to strike back including world class cyber weapons. Other options include sanctions, expulsions and embarrassing Moscow, or other foes, by exposing their attacks in the so-called grey zone, below the level of all-out war. Sources insisted the British forces had ""resilience measures in place"" to ensure the RAF aircraft keep flying, But they warned Russia and China had stolen a march in areas like artillery and missile ranges. ""We need to close the gap in lots of areas,"" the source said. ""If you can be found you can be killed. We have to invest in hiding better and finding them."" The army is braced to lose 10,000 troops and four infantry battalions as part of sweeping modernisation plans. The remaining 72,000 troops will be based abroad more often in a network of bases, in Cypros, Kenya, Oman, Singapore, Gibraltar and Germany, to react more quickly to future crises. Around 80 Challenger 2 tanks and over 700 Warrior armoured fighting vehicles are also due to be axed. Sources insisted the cuts were vital to free up cash for new kit. ""If we didn't retire old kit we would still be fighting with muskets and thoroughbred horses,"" he said. A top defence source said: ""It should not be cost free for people who want to cause us harm. ""We have to exact a price. ""The best defence is offence"""

312,312,The Sun,Harry Cole,Calls for Nicola Sturgeon to resign after Salmond probe reveals she mislead parliament over ‘sexual misconduct scandal’,"NICOLA Sturgeon is facing mounting calls to resign after she was found to have misled the Scottish Parliament in her war with Alex Salmond. The Scottish First Minister was being investigated by a Holyrood committee that has ruled by a 5 to 4 majority that she was not truthful in her evidence given to them.

Ireland and the EU were hoping to strong-arm Mr Biden into criticising the PM's hardline stance over last year's Brexit deal. But the White House said last night it was staying out of it. Mr Johnson enraged Brussels by delaying agreed checks on goods from the UK mainland to Northern Ireland, insisting he is protecting stability and peace.

314,314,The Sun,Nick GutteridgeHarry ColeNatasha Clark,Now Brussels threatens to SEIZE Oxford AZ jab factories with ‘Stalinist’ powers despite several EU countries pulling it,"BRUSSELS today threatened to SEIZE factories on the continent producing the Oxford Astrazeneca jab - despite several countries pausing their rollout of very same vaccine just days ago. In a dramatic escalation of their furious row with the pharma giant, EU boss Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc could even suspend patents on the lifesaving jab so anyone could produce it - but critics branded the threats ""Stalinist."" In a bombshell intervention, the raging German said she did not rule out triggering emergency powers to ""make sure Europeans are vaccinated as soon as possible"" - warning ""all options are on the table"". And in an astonishing broadside aimed at Britain she warned the bloc may restrict vaccine shipments to countries whose rollouts are going far better than its own. Her explosive comments come despite several EU nations pulling the plug on the very same jab earlier this week, citing fears over blood clots. Experts have blasted the claims and insisted it's perfectly safe with no links to clots - and the rollout will continue as planned. Europe's shambolic rollout has been beset with issues, and has been far slower than Britain's. It comes as: Von Der Leyen said today: ""It is hard to explain to our citizens why vaccines produced in the EU are going to other countries that are also producing vaccines, but hardly anything is coming back. ""And the second point that is of importance for us is on whether exports to countries who have higher vaccination rates than us are still in proportion. ""We want to see reciprocity and proportionality in exports, and we are ready to use whatever tools you need to deliver on that. I'm not ruling out anything for now because we have to make sure Europeans are vaccinated as soon as possible ""In other words, we want to have vaccines. This is about making sure that Europe gets a fair share."" The EU chief was asked if Brussels will consider triggering emergency powers that would allow it to seize control of vaccine productions and waive drug makers' patents. She replied: ""All options are on the table. We are in the crisis of the century, and I'm not ruling out anything for now because we have to make sure Europeans are vaccinated as soon as possible."" Such powers have only been used once, which was during the 1970s oil crisis. The remarks reignited a fuming war of words between Britain and the EU which were sparked when the bloc introduced its export restrictions in January. Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith savaged the latest development branding it ""a Stalinist level of direction but tinged with incompetence, chaos and contradictions."" The Brexiteer raged Brussels was in ""a ridiculous position where they have attacked the so-called 'British vaccine'"" but are now demanding more of it. He told The Sun: ""They are just bitter with the UK for having got ahead them on the vaccine and are desperately trying to shift the blame."" And the free market Adam Smith Institute think tank said ""such a Stalinist move to seize private property demeans the continent."" Boss Matt Kilcoyne added: ""Having failed to purchase vaccines, Brussels has now revealed its desire to seize the jabs of others. ""Expropriating private property and blocking the fulfilment of contracts made in good faith makes a mockery of the claim the EU is a rules based organisation and a promoter of free trade."" A No10 spokesperson said today restrictions would ""endanger global efforts to fight the virus"". Downing Street said: ""the global recovery from covid relies on international collaboration"" and urged the EU not to restrict vaccines. Last night EU politicians were blasted for putting the ""faltering bloc"" ahead of people's lives. Tory MP Mark Francois told The Sun: ""The AstraZeneca vaccine is safe, as the European Medicines Agency themselves admit. ""What is deeply regrettable is that some senior EU politicians are now putting the defence of the faltering European Project, before the lives of their own citizens. ""History may not judge them kindly for this."" Europe's chaotic rollout has been savaged by member states across the bloc. European countries have received 14.9 million AZ vaccines, of which they have used just 7.3 million. In comparion, Britain is expected to reach the 25million mark later today. Mrs von der Leyen said that European countries have exported 41 million doses over the past six weeks to 33 countries. She said of 315 shipments only one had been blocked - a delivery of 250,000 AZ jabs from Italy to Australia. Brussels has been embroiled in a bitter battle with AstraZeneca for months over its volume of deliveries to the continent. The Commission chief said it is only set to provide 110 million doses in the first half of this year, out of the 270 million it initially promised. The massive row comes after 20 EU countries fully or partially suspended the use of the AZ vaccine over unsubstantiated blood clot fears this week. In Germany doctors at one vaccination centre were reported to have been brought to tears by having to destroy a batch of unused vaccines, describing the situation as a ""disaster beyond all expectations"". The move has been slammed by opposition MPs there, with socialist health lead Karl Lauterbach calling it a ""big mistake"" that will ""only create great uncertainty and mistrust in a situation where every vaccination counts"". There is anger too across many other European capitals, including Paris and Italy, which feel they were bounced into halting use of the Oxford shot by Berlin's decision to pull the plug. The head of Italy's medicines agency railed against the move as a ""political choice"" and vowed to resume vaccinations at a greater than ever pace as soon as possible. Meanwhile in Poland - which has not suspended use of the jab - a top adviser to the PM suggested a commercially motivated ""disinformation"" campaign designed to benefit AZ's rivals was behind the decisions. The European Medicines Agency, which will publish a review into the jab's safety tomorrow, has repeatedly insisted there is no evidence to link it to rare and dangerous blood clots that have developed in some patients. Its head Emer Cooke said there was ""there is no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions"" and the benefits of taking it far outweigh any risks of side-effects. There have been just 37 reports of clotting events among the more than 17 million people who have received the vaccine across the EU and Britain, according to AstraZeneca. Doctors have said there is no extra risk from the vaccine. Matt Hancock wrote for The Sun today in an attempt to reassure the nation - saying there was no evidence people should be worried."

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab admitted yesterday the Tehran regime kept him up at night with worry. World powers have an agreement with Iran to lift sanctions if it stops trying to build the bomb. But PM Boris Johnson wants to work with US President Joe Biden over Iran, which is accused of funding and training terrorists in the Middle East. The PM's defence review, published yesterday, states: ""Alongside our allies, the UK will hold Iran to account for its nuclear activity, remaining open to talks on a more comprehensive nuclear and regional deal."" A government source added: ""The nuke deal does not go far enough."" Meanwhile, the PM has been forced to defend his plan to bolster Britain's nuclear arsenal — revealed by The Sun yesterday. Mr Raab also said yesterday Britain wants a positive relationship with China but not at the expense of upholding UK values. THE Royal Navy will get five new frigates as part of Boris Johnson's ship-building drive. The escort fleet, currently 13 frigates and six destroyers, will reach 24 by 2030, the PM said. But he warned of ""tough decisions"" as he signalled cuts to the Army's size."
316,316,The Sun,Natasha ClarkHarry ColeJerome Starkey,Boris Johnson warns another pandemic is a ‘realistic possibility’ by 2030 as population growth sparks more viruses,"BORIS Johnson's defence review today warned another pandemic is a ""realistic possibility"" by 2030 as population growth sparks more viruses. The PM today revealed his biggest shake up since the Cold War to MPs - as he vowed more nukes and billions of pounds of extra cash to keep the nation safe in future. His major shake-up revealed that infectious disease outbreaks are likely to be more frequent by the end of the decade. Population growth and the loss of natural habitat would increase interaction between humans and animals, fuelling the risk of a disease spreading from one species to another, like what is thought to have happened with Covid 19. In his foreword to the Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy, the Prime Minister said when work began on the document in early 2020 ""we could not have anticipated how a coronavirus would trigger perhaps the greatest international crisis since the Second World War, with tragic consequences that will persist for years to come"". He added: ""Covid-19 has reminded us that security threats and tests of national resilience can take many forms."" In a section on global health - listed as one of the ""transnational challenges"" facing the world - the document said: ""Infectious disease outbreaks are likely to be more frequent to 2030. ""Many will be zoonoses - diseases caused by viruses, bacteria or parasites that spread from animals to humans - as population growth drives the intensification of agriculture and as the loss of habitats increases interaction between humans and animals. ""Another novel pandemic remains a realistic possibility."" The review sets out the need for a fresh national and international plan to deal with a global pandemic. The report added: ""The Government will continue to prepare for and respond to individual risks, whether terrorism, flooding or a new pandemic. ""Learning the lessons of Covid-19, we will also seek to build a better understanding of the UK's strengths and weaknesses, and improve our national preparedness and readiness across the whole risk lifecycle, from anticipation to recovery."" Ministers scrambled to get enough access to PPE and ramp up testing in the last year as a result of the pandemic. But Britain's fast work on vaccines and scientific research put us ahead of the game when it comes to creating the world-leading jabs programme. Today's major defence review includes plans for: The PM said today he is determined that the UK will continue to be an outward-looking country despite leaving the EU, and will play a key role on the world stage. And he vowed his new strategy would ""make the United Kingdom stronger, safer and more prosperous whilst standing up for our values"". Britain's commitment to NATO and the EU was ""unconditional and immoveable"" and our new strategy will make the UK ""match-fit for a more competitive world"", he said. He told MPs:  ""Our international policy is a vital instrument for fulfilling this government's vision of uniting and levelling up across our country,   reinforcing the Union, and securing Britain's place as a science superpower and a hub of innovation and research"". Boris said it would ""bolster our alliances and strengthen our capabilities"" and vowed for a new phase in relations with China, demanding the UK ""relearn the art of competing against states with opposing values"". And he vowed to use the COP26 climate conference this year to ""rally, as many nations as possible by the target of net zero by 2050."" Boris promised the US would continue to be the UK's ""greatest ally"" going forward. But MPs lashed out and said it was a missed opportunity to crack down on China. The PM admitted he had ""deep concern"" over China's mass detention of Uighur people in shinjang and the global superpower poses a ""great challenge"" to the UK, he vowed to work with China and now shut them out in the cold. He told MPs: ""We will work with China, where that is consistent with our values, and interests, including building a stronger and positive economic relationship."" Those who call for a new Cold War with China ""are mistaken"", the PM insisted. ""We have a balance to strike, and will take tough measures to call out China."" The Sun revealed last night the PM will dramatically Britain's arsenal of nukes in a dangerous post-Covid world - with terrorists poised for a successful nuclear or ""dirty bomb"" attack within 9 years. Troops will serve overseas ""more often and for longer"" as Britain tries to carve out an aggressive role as the world's policeman in the ""new frontiers"" of space and cyber-warfare. Boris also vowed to ""defend the integrity of our nation against state threats, whether in the form of illicit finance or coercive economic measures, disinformation, cyber-attacks, electoral interference or even – three years after the Salisbury attack – the use of chemical or other weapons of mass destruction."" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the report will help create ""better-paid jobs of the future"" and ""answer questions"" about what role Britain will take on globally now we're outside the EU. The nuclear deterrent will be upped from the current stock of not more than 180 warheads to not more than 260, amid fears other countries are ""increasing and diversifying their nuclear arsenals."" Mr Raab today confirmed the move to boost Britain's nuclear arsenal, insisting ""over time as the circumstances change and the threats change, we need to maintain a minimum credible level of deterrent."" He added: ""Why? Because it is the ultimate guarantee, the ultimate insurance policy against the worst threat from hostile states.""

He said: ""There's no doubt that China represents the generational threat and the reason for that is that the idea that China will become more like us as it gets richer, or as its economy matured, is clearly for the birds.

317,317,The Sun,Nick GutteridgeHarry ColeJerome Starkey,Boris Johnson unveils bumper post-Brexit vision for defence as he vows more nukes to keep nation safe,"BORIS Johnson today revealed his bumper post-Brexit vision for defence as he vowed more nukes and billions of pounds of extra cash to keep the nation safe in future. The PM today revealed his biggest shake up since the Cold War to MPs - which will shape the future of our armed forces and foreign policy for a decade to come. He said today he is determined that the UK will continue to be an outward-looking country despite leaving the EU, and will play a key role on the world stage. And he vowed his new strategy would ""make the United Kingdom stronger, safer and more prosperous whilst standing up for our values"". Britain's commitment to NATO and the EU was ""unconditional and immoveable"" and our new strategy will make the UK ""match-fit for a more competitive world"", he said. The told MPs:  ""Our international policy is a vital instrument for fulfilling this government's vision of uniting and levelling up across our country,   reinforcing the Union, and securing Britain's place as a science superpower and a hub of innovation and research"". Boris said it would ""bolster our alliances and strengthen our capabilities"" and vowed for a new phase in relations with China, demanding the UK ""relearn the art of competing against states with opposing values"". And he vowed to use the COP26 climate conference this year to ""rally, as many nations as possible by the target of net zero by 2050."" Boris promised the US would continue to be the UK's ""greatest ally"" going forward. But MPs lashed out and said it was a missed opportunity to crack down on China. The PM admitted he had ""deep concern"" over China's mass detention of Uighur people in shinjang and the global superpower poses a ""great challenge"" to the UK, he vowed to work with China and now shut them out in the cold. He told MPs: ""We will work with China, where that is consistent with our values, and interests, including building a stronger and positive economic relationship."" Those who call for a new Cold War with China ""are mistaken"", the PM insisted. ""We have a balance to strike, and will take tough measures to call out China."" The Sun revealed last night the PM will dramatically Britain's arsenal of nukes in a dangerous post-Covid world - with terrorists poised for a successful nuclear or ""dirty bomb"" attack within 9 years. Troops will serve overseas ""more often and for longer"" as Britain tries to carve out an aggressive role as the world's policeman in the ""new frontiers"" of space and cyber-warfare. The review includes Boris also vowed to ""defend the integrity of our nation against state threats, whether in the form of illicit finance or coercive economic measures, disinformation, cyber-attacks, electoral interference or even – three years after the Salisbury attack – the use of chemical or other weapons of mass destruction."" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the report will help create ""better-paid jobs of the future"" and ""answer questions"" about what role Britain will take on globally now we're outside the EU. He said: ""It talks about marshalling our strengths - we should feel self-confident about this country, about the ingenuity of our people, the strength of our union, our military clout but also our cultural brand abroad. ""It looks at how we take those comparative advantages, from trade to tech, from our hard military power to our development policy and our aid budget. ""And it sets out how we can create the better-paid jobs of the future but also how we can protect ourselves from threats, whether it is from the likes of Russia and China or pandemics or indeed climate change."" The nuclear deterrent will be upped from the current stock of not more than 180 warheads to not more than 260, amid fears other countries are ""increasing and diversifying their nuclear arsenals."" Mr Raab today confirmed the move to boost Britain's nuclear arsenal, insisting ""over time as the circumstances change and the threats change, we need to maintain a minimum credible level of deterrent."" He added: ""Why? Because it is the ultimate guarantee, the ultimate insurance policy against the worst threat from hostile states.""

320,320,The Sun,Natasha ClarkHarry Cole,Ministers intervene in furious row over Cumbria coal mine and order fresh public inquiry,"ROBERT Jenrick has bowed to pressure in long-running row over a new coal mine in Cumbria tonight - ordering a fresh inquiry into whether it can go ahead. Cumbria County Council was due to review the decision to open the first new coal mine in Britain for decades, after approving it twice. After an outcry from green campaigners, ministers have u-turned and it will now be subject to a local public inquiry. But a furious row erupted in Westminster after Tory MPs complained they would miss out on massive investment in their local area They pounded Downing Street with furious complaints about the u-turn. Workington MP Mark Jenkinson told the Tory MP's Whatsapp group that Mr Jenrick has ""bowed to climate terrorists"" and said the decision was a ""kick in the teeth"". He pointed to the likely loss of £165m in private investment to his area. And former Minister Robert Goodwill added that the UK would be forced to buy steel ""from those lovely Chinese people instead."" And the new mine would be in Copeland seat of Boris Johnson's key aide Trudy Harrison. She is under pressure tonight to quit as the PM's parliamentary bagcarrier. One MP said: ""She's been made to look a fool and should not put up with this."" An independent head of planning will make the final call on whether it can go ahead, taking the decision out of local chiefs' hands. The Housing Secretary tonight ordered planning bosses to get involved instead, calling the decision in. In letters explaining the decision, it says: ""The Secretary of State has decided to call this application in because of the further developments since his original decision. ""The Climate Change Committee's recommendations for the 6th Carbon Budget have been published since he was advised on this decision. ""The Secretary of State recognises that proponents and opponents take different positions on that matter, and considers that this should be explored during a public inquiry. ""Furthermore controversy about the application has increased."" Officials on the Climate Change Committee wrote to Mr Jenrick earlier this year warning it would increase Britain's polluting emissions and would undo work to reach net legally binding targets. And they said it was a bad look just months before hosting the international climate summit. The Government had previously vowed not to reverse the decision. But it was revealed last month that due to the high sulphur content of the coal itself, it might be able to be used at all - either in Britain or sold to other markets. Most of the coal is expected to be exported to other countries, with around 15 per cent shipped to companies in the UK. The decision comes just hours after COP President Alok Sharma said the issue of the coal mine was a ""local matter"". Campaigners were up in arms about Britain opening its first coal mine in decades - the same year as it hosts an international climate crisis demanding nations around the world go green. But local Tories said it would create hundreds of jobs, and it was more eco-friendly to dig up coal in the UK - which is needed to make steel - rather than fly it thousands of miles from all over the world. One Red Wall Tory last night was said to be ""absolutely apoplectic"" about the decision - and others were confused as to why a sudden u-turn had been ordered. Some Cabinet ministers were understood to have preferred the case to be decided by independent planning inspectors rather than have ministers decide. One source said: ""It's a politically toxic row with two marginal 'Red Wall' seats nearby. ""Some ministers would be quietly relieved if they decided not to go ahead with it."" MAKING simple everyday changes can add up to a BIG difference to the planet. And we want you and your family to join The Sun's Green Team - our eco revolution. It can feel overwhelming to know how to play a part in reducing greenhouse gasses, but we will be showing you the practical steps we can take to curb climate change - with the help of the global 'Count Us In' initiative. And our easy measures will even help you SAVE money so your household budget goes further. We'll help you to reduce food waste, insulate your home, create tasty planet-friendly meals and take simple steps to trim your carbon footprint. We want you to go online to sign-up to as many of our special Green Team pledges as you can manage and a special calculator will show you how much carbon you will personally save. It won't cost you a penny but the total you and your family will save will be added to the global 'Count Us In' total and the platform will support you every step of the way. So tap here to pledge. Labour's shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, welcomed the news tonight. He said: ""The truth is that this mine is terrible for our fight against climate change, won't help our steel industry and won't create secure jobs. ""The Government must now block the mine and focus instead on real solutions to secure the long-term future of UK steel - and create low-carbon jobs in Cumbria and across the country with a proper green stimulus."" Nearby MP Tim Farron added: ""It's fantastic news that the Government have at long last finally woken up to the fact that this mine would be an alrighty backwards step in our fight against climate change.

321,321,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor","Amazon and Serco get ‘unbelievable’ New Year Honours help despite Covid rows, Whitehall data leak reveals","CONTROVERSIAL pandemic profiteers Serco and Amazon have been urged to apply for New Year's honours despite being at the centre of Covid rows, a major Whitehall data leak has revealed. The companies are amongst a number of businesses and industry giants asked to nominate staff members for a gong from the Queen in a list accidentally leaked by bungling officials. The top civil servant at the Business department wrote to firms including Capita, investment giants Blackrock and BP. Tech giants Facebook, Google and Apple were also given the nod. Serco boss Rupert Soames was amongst those to receive the letter. As were consulting giants Mckinsey, PWC and Deloitte and Bain. Sarah Munby, the BEIS permanent secretary, wrote: ""I would like to invite you to submit Honours nominations on behalf of your organisation as well as for any other individuals you think worthy of recognition."" She also invited the bosses to online classes on ""how to master and award honours nomination."" Vaccine heroes Astrazeneca and Pfizer have also been asked to put forward staff to be rewarded. The personal contact details of some of Britain's most powerful business bosses were included in the email accidentally CC'd to all of them on Wednesday morning. The email addresses of leading union bosses were also included in the blunder. Royal Mail bosses, banking giants, rail and energy chiefs were also asked to come forward with names. As was the under fire Post Office and accounting giants who are never far from controversy. The leak appears to be a major breach of GDPR rules as well as major embarrassment to ministers amid a number of Covid rows. It comes just a day after the Test and Trace programme - part run by Serco - was slammed by MPs as a waste of money. And Amazon have been locked in a number of rows with the Treasury about their tax and impact on Britain's high streets. Rachel Reeves MP, Shadow Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, branded the letter ""unbelievable."" She added: ""The Conservatives' priorities: a pay cut for our nurses and a gong for Serco. The mask is slipping."" Labour's Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""This is beggars belief. ""On the day Test & Trace was slammed for costing the taxpayer billions while failing to control this horrific virus its staggering government were offering to spray gongs around like confetti to firms involved. ""Ministers should be focusing on fixing Test and Trace not offering up rewards for failure."" Last night Beis said they had apologised to the firms. They said: ""As part of the New Year's Honours process, we work with a wide range of business groups and other stakeholders to encourage an ever-increasingly wide and diverse spread of nominations. ""But to be clear, these emails do not indicate that any specific individual is being actively considered for New Year's Honours and any nominations received still need to go through a comprehensive, independent consideration process. ""BEIS takes its information and data handling responsibilities very seriously under the UK GDPR. We have contacted the parties concerned to apologise for the error and taken steps to mitigate any further incidents."""
322,322,The Sun,Harry ColeEllie CambridgeJames Somper,Schools reopening: Joy as millions of pupils head back to classroom and first lockdown restrictions are eased,"MILLIONS of kids headed back to school for the first time in months yesterday as the first lockdown restrictions were eased. Jubilant parents tasked with weeks of home-schooling waved their children off to classes with teachers. Boris Johnson hailed it has a ""big day and a emotional day for millions of families"" while headteachers said the number of kids returning was ""very encouraging"". Among parents happy to see off their kids were Colin and Dawn Royle who cheered as Isabella, ten, and Joshua, nine, left for school in Audenshaw, Gtr Manchester. Teachers at the Hazelwood Integrated Primary School in Newtownabbey, Northern Ireland, built a ""Welcome"" balloon arch for pupils. One excited youngster ran up and hugged her teacher. Primary schools opened in full yesterday but most secondary schools are phasing their return Their children are being asked to take lateral flow tests to help curb the spread of Covid-19. Erin Horn took one at Outwood Academy in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, after two months away. At Harris Academy in Sutton, South London, pupils waited in lines to return to class after a break. The PM said some pupils would be ""anxious"" after so much time away but he added the ""overwhelming feeling is one of relief"". He said: ""We all know that the education of our children is so important that the greater risk now is keeping them out of school for a day longer. He thanked teachers who have worked throughout ""remotely or in person"" and parents and others who taught kids at home. He told last night's No.10 press conference: ""It's thanks to this huge national effort to keep kids at home that we have been able significantly to reduce the spread of the virus."" Top government doctor Jenny Harries said she was ""hopeful"" schools would not have to close again thanks to mass testing. Geoff Barton, General Secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said attendance in most schools was ""very encouraging"". He said the requirement to provide on-site Covid tests had been ""onerous"" and introducing face coverings in class had been a ""minefield"" for teachers to navigate. Dr Mary Bousted, National Education Union chief, said it was possible children may have to return to remote learning. She said: ""I hope, and my members hope, this will be the last time we close schools to the majority of pupils. But the jury's out."" Experts believe kids who have spent a long time away from school could suffer ""longer-term scarring"". Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, told Times Radio: ""We closed down our children's lives. ""The key issues around meeting friends, development socially, learning to trust, learning to be human, learning all of those things, that's been lost as well as the loss of actual straight-up learning. ""Many of those things can't be done online. The harms to mental health are very clear. ""We know that there's a lot more anxiety and depression and eating disorders around among children and young people. ""The thing we don't know is how much of this is essentially a superficial flesh wound that will heal when they're back at school, and how much of it will lead to longer-term scarring."" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is looking at proposals, including a five-term academic year, a shorter summer holiday and longer school days to help pupils catch up on learning."
323,323,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Rich private donors to be asked to pay for makeover of public parts of 10 Downing Street,"RICH private donors will be asked to pay for a makeover of public parts of 10 Downing Street where Boris Johnson entertains world leaders and MPs. Amid a row over taxpayers funding the spruce up mystery big-bucks backers meeting the cost instead will be unveiled later in the year, The Sun has learnt. Downing Street denied that Tory Party funds will be used to pay for the refurbishment. No10 insiders also reject claims the PM and his fiancée Carrie Symonds are redoing their entire grace and favour flat and stinging the public for the bill. A Government source said around £30,000 of taxpayer funds are available to all PMs for the upkeep of their flat and ""some"" of that has been spent since Mr Johnson moved into Downing Street in 2019. But they do say whole swathes of the sprawling building need a spruce up after years of wear and tear and the taxpayer will be protected. The redecoration will include the Cabinet Room, formal State Rooms and other rooms where entertaining by the PM takes place. One source said: ""When world leaders meet Biden they get to go to the White House, when they come here they see the sh*te house."" The Prime Minister's press secretary Allegra Stratton told reporters on Monday: ""Conservative Party funds are not being used to pay for any refurbishment of the Downing Street estate."" She added the Conservative HQ ""supports the leader of the Tory Party in their political activities but not in the way it is being accused of"". Asked whether the party had encouraged donors to pay for the refurbishment, Ms Stratton said any donations would be declared through the Electoral Commission, the House of Commons' register of members' interests, or in ministerial transparency declarations. ""At every twist and turn of this there will be records and reports,"" she said. The Sun understands the wider makeover of the building will be paid for private donors, with a the Cabinet Office mulling plans to set up a ""trust"" to protect the listed national landmark. No10 said any cost of refurbishment will be published in annual accounts due in July."

When unsure voters were excluded, a poll found 52 per cent to 48 per cent in favour of staying in the UK. The survey was carried out days after the First Minister was quizzed by the Holyrood inquiry into the unlawful investigation of her predecessor. In all, 35 per cent said the probe made them less likely to vote for independence, and 45 per cent said their trust in Ms Sturgeon had fallen."
325,325,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Low paid Brits and renters risk being left behind in green car revolution,"LOW paid Brits will be unable to switch to green vehicles without significant financial support, a new study shows. Plans to force drivers over to electric cars risk being fatally undermined if low-income families are unable to pay for the charging points needed, according to the Social Market Foundation. From 2030 the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans will be banned as ministers try to accelerate the switch to electric vehicles - currently one in ten cars sold is electric. But the plans will need 600,000 charging points installed across Britain outside homes, on streets in car parks and at workplaces. But renters and the lower paid look set to miss out without support. And resentment to the high price of going green could derail the whole agenda. The SMF think tank say: ""The perception of unfairness is a grave threat to the mass adoption of electric vehicles."" And they argue ""if the costs and disruption of the EV transition fall too heavily on people who feel no benefit – because they cannot afford an EV or access convenient and affordable charging for one – public consent for Net Zero will be dangerously weakened."" They cite polling from Opinium that shows while 35pc of richer voters object to meeting the cost of charging points, that soars to 47pc of the lowest paid voters. 57pc of rich back the petrol and diesel ban, compared to 43pc of lower social class voters. Industry chiefs warn going green will remain the preserve of ""leafy suburban avenues"" without a major rethink. Keith Anderson, Chief Executive of ScottishPower, said: ""On its own, the market is less likely to reach urban streets where off-street parking isn't an option, or our more remote rural communities. ""We need to make sure that everyone  – not just wealthy high streets and leafy suburban avenues – feels the benefits."" Amy Norman of the SMF added: ""Ensuring charging is affordable, accessible and convenient for everyone – irrespective of income, housing or where someone lives - will be necessary for maintaining public and political support for Net Zero."" ""The Government is right to be ambitious with its 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles but it needs to be equally ambitious with support offered to low-income households and areas where the market is failing to provide."""
326,326,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Boris Johnson says kids more at risk from staying at home and schools ‘ready’ for return,"TEACHERS, parents and kids are all ready for schools to reopen on Monday and feel a burning need to get back to class, Boris Johnson declared today. The Prime Minister insisted kids are more at risk from staying at home due to missing out on learning than they are from Covid in the classroom - boasting ""we are ready."" And the Education Secretary added that schools will stay open after the Easter break come what may. Ministers are braced for a surge in the virus ""R"" rate due to kids mixing in classrooms once again, but Gavin Williamson said Monday's return must be ""irreversible."" Thanking teachers and parents for six weeks of home-schooling and efforts getting ready to return, the PM declared: ""I'm very hopeful that it will work, it will all go according to plan."" Mr Johnson said that tomorrow will be ""the first big step of the roadmap that we hope is a roadmap to freedom and it's made possible by the rollout of the vaccination programme."" Secondary school kids will also be mass-tested for the bug as schools get ready to fling open the gates for the first time in six weeks. Speaking on Sunday morning on a visit to Christian community centre in Brent, Northwest London, Mr Johnson thanked teachers for the massive reopening efforts ahead of Monday's return. ""I'm massively grateful to parents who've put up with so much throughout the pandemic - and the teachers who have done an amazing job of keeping going - but I do think that we're ready."" He added: ""I think people want to go back - I think they feel it, they feel the need for it, and you ask about the risk - I think the risk is actually in not going back to school tomorrow given all the suffering, all the loss of learning we have seen."" In her final address as children's commissioner for England last month, Anne Longfield said it was ""impossible to overstate how damaging the past year has been for many children"". And Mr Johnson's comments echoed England's chief schools inspector who expressed concern about eating disorders and self-harming among children after she said pupils endured ""boredom, loneliness, misery and anxiety"" during the school shutdown since January. Amanda Spielman said home learning ""has been a real slog"" for many and that teachers and parents ""need to be alert"" to more serious mental health difficulties persisting for a minority of children even after classrooms open again this morning. The Ofsted boss said for the ""vast majority of children the restoration of normality"" should be enough to ""lift those symptoms"" of mental health difficulties like loneliness and anxiety. And she added that there is ""no perfect solution"" for exam results this year but that teacher assessments were ""a good attempt at creating the best we can do in very, very unsatisfactory circumstances"". It came as the Education Secretary said proposed changes to the summer holidays and longer school days were being considered for helping pupils catch up on lost learning during the pandemic. Summer holidays could be slashed with a five-term year and longer school days in the biggest reform since the Second World War. Mr Williamson said education catch-up tsar Sir Kevan Collins was looking at ""a whole range of different proposals"" And he vowed the government would be ""enhancing support to teachers and making sure they can be the very best of themselves."" Speaking ahead of schools reopening, Mr Williamson said the education sector was ""leading the way"" He told the BBC: """"This is our first step, our real first step in terms of moving out of national lockdown and it is our schools that are leading the way."" ""We are very much factoring in as part of the road map that actually schools will be staying open. ""That is why we are taking a cautious approach because we intend for it to be an irreversible approach and that schools will continue to remain open."" And he gave a guarantee that schools would return again after the Easter holidays, saying that would always be the government's intention. Despite the pivotal role teachers have played in the pandemic and easing of lockdown, Mr Williamson used his Sunday morning tour of the TV studios to confirm they would not be getting a pay rise like nurses. He told Sky News: ""What we all recognise is that this is a period of making sure we have restraint right across the public sector. ""But we aren't nervous about investing in those key public services such as the NHS, such as schools."" Defending the teachers pay freeze, he added: """"We saw this year the largest pay increase for teachers since 2005. ""But there is going to be pay restraint, there is going to be a pay freeze for the coming year but we are continuing to invest in schools."""

Instead the Prime Minister will have key parts of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's historic TV sit down read out to him by aides first thing on Monday morning. Asked about Royal dramas due to be broadcast at 1am UK time, Mr Johnson said it was too late for him to stay up and it was ""unlikely"" he would watch it on catch-up as he was too busy rolling out the Covid jab. Speaking on a vaccine visit in Brent, Northwest London, the PM said ""of course I'm interested in all sorts of stuff around the world."" But he added: ""It's quite late our time so I'll probably miss it and I'll be focussing, as I'm sure you would expect and the people of the country would expect, I'm focusing on rolling out the vaccine."" Downing Street sources say Mr Johnson will be fully briefed on the developments and accusations made by Meghan and Harry first thing on Monday morning. Asked if he would be ""setting the Sky+ box"" to record the turbulent event instead, the PM quipped: ""I think it unlikely. We're focusing on the vaccine rollout and economic recovery."" Meanwhile Education Secretary Gavin Williamson declared ""the whole nation stands up for the Queen"" in the Royal soap opera.

But the government could yet u-turn on to to see off a strike, Gavin Williamson hinted. The Education Secretary said the offer was ""part of a process"" but added ""no one wants to see a industrial action."" Mr Williamson stressed NHS workers the only part of the public sector to see any rise this year because of a ""period of restraint"" sparked by £407 billion of pandemic spending. Mr Williamson said on Sunday morning TV that that the Department of Health had ""put forward what we believe we can afford"" for nurses during ""difficult economic challenges"". He stressed teachers and others in the public sector will face a pay freeze, with NHS staff the only group to be exempted following their efforts during the crisis. Speaking on a visit to a vaccine hub in Northwest London shortly after, the PM added he was ""massively grateful to all NHS staff"" insisting ""what we have done is tried to give them as much as we can."" Mr Johnson said: ""the independent pay review body will obviously look at what we've proposed and come back."" ""Don't forget that there has been a public sector pay freeze - we're in pretty tough times - we've tried to give the NHS as much as we possibly can, and that means in addition to the £140bn annual money we've got another £62bn that we've found to help support the NHS throughout the crisis."" But Labour have branded the offer ""reprehensible"" and nurses unions are mulling a walk out. Dame Donna Kinnair, Chief Executive and General Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ""Boris Johnson is still failing to understand the situation he has stumbled into - more of these warm words for nurses are not going to cut it."" She warned: ""The prime minister must put his money where his mouth is."" Mr Williamson told Sky News: ""What we all recognise is that this is a period of making sure we have restraint right across the public sector. ""We're facing almost three-quarters of a million people who are unemployed and we have in the context of that decided to exempt the NHS from the public sector pay freeze, which is the only part of the public sector that has been exempted from that."" And speaking to the BBC he left the door open to a climbdown, adding: ""We've put forward what we believe we can afford and is part of a process and that is what will be looked at."" But Labour frontbencher hit back Lisa Nandy said the rise recommended by ministers to the independent pay bodies amounts to a ""real-terms pay cut"" as it will be outflanked by inflation. The opposition say a newly-qualified nurse earning a £24,907 salary would face a real-terms cut to the tune of £174 if the rise goes ahead. Ms Nandy told Sky News: ""The Government, to be clear, is not planning a pay rise. ""That is a real-terms pay cut because it doesn't keep up with inflation, and for nurses to be offered a pay cut is just reprehensible in our view. ""We think nurses deserve a pay rise this year and that should never have been something that was up for negotiation - this is a Government that has completely got its priorities wrong."""

Ministers will finally put legislation hiking the maximum sentence that reckless drivers can get from 14 years to life before the Commons on Tuesday after years of delay. The new Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill will include provisions for those who kill when speeding, racing or using a phone to get the toughest possible sentence. And killer drivers who were under the influence of drink or drugs will also be able to be locked up for life. The current maximum sentence for each crime is 14 years. The idea was first suggested in 2015, and more than two thirds of respondents backed it when it was put to public consultation a year later. Last year Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said: ""This government has been clear that punishments must fit the crime, but too often families tell us this isn't the case with killer drivers."" The new bill will also double the maximum sentence for assaulting an emergency worker from 12 months to 2 years. It will also toughen up early release for dangerous criminals and terrorists. Rapists and violent lags will also have to serve two thirds of their sentence rather than half before being considered for release. Police will also be given new powers over protests that disrupt the public like Extinction Rebellion, as well as increased stop and search powers to tackle knife crime."

332,332,The Sun,Harry Cole,Joe Biden hits pause on Donald Trump’s US punitive tariffs on Scotch whisky in huge Brexit boost,"JOE Biden has paused Donald Trump's tariffs on whisky exports to the United States in a half a billion pound Brexit bonanza. The US slapped crippling 25pc taxes on British exports like Scotch or JCBs in 2019 in a row with the EU over aeroplane parts. Research by the Scotch Whisky Association research shows it has cost the industry more than £500million so far in lost business. But free from Brussels, Liz Truss negotiated a new deal with the White House that will see the punishing tariffs suspended from Monday. It's a massive boost for Scottish industry - and will also boost exports of cashmere and cheese. The UK exported £340million of single malt to the US in 2018, as well as £60million of construction vehicles and £45million worth of cheese. The UK and US governments have today committed to ""a joint de-escalation"" of the long-running dispute between aerospace giants Airbus and Boeing. Britain suspended tariffs on Boeing parts last December in a good will gesture. On Monday, the United States will temporarily suspend all retaliatory tariffs on direct exports from the UK to the US resulting from the Airbus dispute for four months, in an effort to reach a negotiation solution to the 16-year long row. Trade bosses say the move will help struggling producers protect jobs in Scotland, where the Scotch industry supports 50,000 workers, with whisky tariffs being slashed from 25% to zero. Scotch was the UK's largest food and drink export in 2020. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said today: ""From Scotch whisky distillers to Stilton-makers, businesses across the UK will benefit from the US decision today to suspend tariffs in this dispute. ""It shows what the UK can do as an independent trading nation, striking deals that back our businesses and support free and fair trade. ""I now look forward to strengthening the UK-US relationship, as we drive economic growth and build back better together."" From Scotch whisky distillers to Stilton-makers, the US decision to suspend tariffs on some UK exports today will benefit businesses right across the UK. Fantastic news as we strengthen the UK-US trading relationship and work to build back better from the pandemic. https://t. co/p5XO8RTA9T Trade boss Liz Truss said today: ""I am delighted to say that our American allies – under their new President and his hard-working staff at the US Trade Representative - have embraced our move to seek a fair settlement. ""This is Global Britain in action: securing new opportunities as a newly nimble nation. ""And the benefits will be felt across our nation, especially in Scotland, as Scotch whisky, the UK's largest food and drink export in 2020, will be even better value for consumers in the United States, its most valuable market. ""The easier it is for Americans to buy a bottle of Macallan, Talisker or Glenmorangie, the more money those producers will have to invest in their businesses, their staff and futures. This news shows– put simply – that trade equals jobs."" Ms Truss also cited the benefits for cashmere producers in Ayrshire, who export goods worth £12million to the US annually, and English cheesemakers. The UK and US are continuing to work towards an ambitious trade deal, which could eliminate almost £500million in tariffs on UK exports to the US. Chief Executive of the Scotch Whisky Association Karen Betts hailed the news today. She said: ""This is fabulous news, and our industry is delighted. ""The tariff on Single Malt Scotch Whisky exports to the US has been doing real damage to Scotch Whisky in the sixteen months it has been in place, with exports to the US falling by 35%, costing companies over half a billion pounds. ""So today, everyone in our industry – from small companies to large – is breathing a sigh of relief."""
333,333,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha Clark,Rishi Sunak’s Budget will save jobs but push tax burden to highest levels in 50 years,"RISHI Sunak did all he could yesterday to lift spirits and see the UK through Covid — freezing booze and fuel duty, and extending furlough. But the Chancellor's bittersweet Budget also set out a £66billion tax raid to start paying for the pandemic — pushing the taxation burden to levels not seen since the 1960s. Teeing up a comeback summer, he froze booze and fuel duties, extended furlough, the stamp duty and VAT holidays for pubs and restaurants and the business rates pause. But millions more will have an income tax hangover next year and big business will see their corporation tax bill soar from 19 to 25 per cent in 2023. Mr Sunak said last night he was going long on support, with the hefty tab only kicking in after the economy has been given time to recover from the pandemic. The Chancellor said, thanks to the vaccine, Britain would bounce back ""swifter and faster"". There were at least five years of pain ahead but he declared: ""Our recovery starts today."" High street shops, hair salons and pubs will be able to apply for new lifelines and VAT on hospitality will remain at five per cent until June, rising to 12.5 per cent for the rest of the year rather than 20 per cent. The economy is expected to return to pre-Covid levels by the middle of next year, six months earlier than previously thought. FUEL duty is frozen for the 11th year running in a victory for The Sun's Keep It Down campaign. The rate was pegged at 57.95p per litre after the Chancellor abandoned plans to raise it. There were fears an increase would punish drivers who are helping the country bounce back. Rishi Sunak said: ""Right now, to keep the cost of living low, I'm not prepared to increase the cost of a tank of fuel."" It comes after a decade of campaigning by Fair Fuel UK and Tory MPs led by backbencher Robert Halfon. Mr Halfon said: ""A big thank you to the Sun's Keep it Down campaign and Fair Fuel UK."" Brit drivers already pay the most at the pumps in Europe. A VAT cut on food and drink has been extended, in a £485million boost for pubs and restaurants. The rate will stay at five per cent until September before jumping to 12.5 per cent and returning to 20 per cent in April 2022. Beer duty has also been pegged, while pubs, restaurants and shops will get grants worth up to £18,000 to reopen. Ex-model Jodie Kidd, owner of The Half Moon pub in Kirdford, West Sussex, said: ""A freeze in beer duty is a welcome relief."" But some publicans warned it did little to help food-free pubs. Campaign for Pubs vice chair Dawn Hopkins said: ""It seems Rishi Sunak either doesn't understand, or doesn't care about, the classic community local pub."" But Mr Sunak warned the virus ""has done and is still doing profound damage"" and it was time to start addressing the state of the nation's finances. Government borrowing is expected to be more than £355billion this year, representing 17 per cent of UK income and the highest level since World War Two. Mr Sunak told MPs: ""Next year, as we continue our unprecedented response to this crisis, borrowing is forecast to be £234billion, 10.3 per cent of GDP — an amount so large it has only one rival in recent history: this year."" He added: ""Without corrective action, borrowing would continue at very high levels, leaving underlying debt rising indefinitely. ""Instead, because of the steps I am taking today, borrowing falls to 4.5 per cent of GDP in 22/23, 3.5 per cent in 23/24, then 2.9 per cent and 2.8 per cent in the following two years."" A million more people will pay income tax from next April, and a million more will be nudged into the higher rate, generating £19billion extra for the public purse by 2026. Despite the Tory manifesto promising no rise in income tax, the thresholds at which people pay will be frozen from next year. But Mr Sunak insisted those that earn more will pay more and no one's current take-home pay will go down. Confronted over the size of the tax burden at a Downing Street press conference last night, Mr Sunak said he could not be compared to other Chancellors. He said: ""We haven't had a pandemic like this in over 100 years, so remember that is why we are having this conversation."" The point at which people begin paying income tax will increase by £70 to £12,570 in April but will be maintained at that level until April 2026, meaning more will be dragged into paying tax as wages increase. Last night, the Office for Budget Responsibility said the decision would bring 1.3million into the tax system. We haven't had a pandemic like this in over 100 years, so remember that is why we are having this conversation. The 40p higher rate threshold will rise to £50,270 and then be frozen. And the watchdog said that would raise £8billion per year by 2025/26 if incomes rose with inflation. Meanwhile, corporation tax will increase from 19 per cent to 25 per cent in 2023. But a new small profits rate will maintain the lower rate for those with profits of £50,000 and after that the rate will be tapered up to protect small and struggling businesses. The OBR said these two measures, plus taking about £4billion a year more off annual departmental spending plans, would raise a total of £31.8billion in 2025/26. But they warned it will increase the tax burden from 34 per cent to 35 per cent of GDP, saying: ""It will be its highest level since Roy Jenkins was Chancellor in the late 1960s."" Businesses last night welcomed the Budget but warned it could worry future investors. The Confederation of British Industry said: ""The Chancellor has gone above and beyond to protect UK businesses and people's livelihoods through the crisis and get firms spending. ""Thousands of firms will be relieved to receive support to finish the job and get through the coming months. ""But moving corporation tax to 25 per cent in one leap will cause a sharp intake of breath for many businesses and sends a worrying signal to those planning to invest in the UK."" The Institute of Directors commented: ""The extension to the furlough scheme will provide a vital cushion to support jobs as restrictions unwind and firms begin the costly process of rescaling."" The British Chambers of Commerce said Mr Sunak had ""listened and acted on our calls for immediate support"". And the Federation of Small Businesses declared: ""This Budget will help many small firms with their final push through to September but there is little here to aid job creation or help people return to work."""
334,334,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha Clark,Budget 2021: Housing to income tax – have Rishi Sunak’s policies left your glass half full?,"CHANCELLOR Rishi Sunak had a tough job on his hands with yesterday's Budget. He needed to make efforts to start repairing the damage done by the pandemic — but at the same time he needed to make sure Brits would not be too badly hit in the short-term given that the crisis is still ongoing. The Sun has examined Mr Sunak's policies to see how they affect you. So have they left your glass half full — or will you be turning it upside down to tip out the last dregs? INCOME TAX: Income tax rates are not going up but band levels are being frozen. That means over two million people will either see their tax bill go up or start paying it for the first time. This ""stealth tax"" will raise £20billion over five years. CORPORATION TAX: Big business will have to foot the bill for the pandemic with a hike in their corporation tax to 25 per cent from 2023. It is set to raise billions to bolster the economy by 2026. But the rate will still be lower than other G7 nations. SELF EMPLOYED: An estimated 600,000 people are eligible to apply for two more batches of pandemic cash. Anyone who filled in a tax return before the Budget will be eligible for up to £7,500 for every financial quarter, at a total cost of £12billion. BOOZE AND PUBS: Booze duty was frozen for the second year running, while the VAT cut for hospitality venues will stay at five per cent until September. Pubs, restaurants and shops will also be handed grants worth up to £18,000 to reopen. FURLOUGH: The scheme will continue until September. The Government will pay wages up to £2,500-a-month until the end of June. Firms will then be expected to contribute an extra 10% in July, rising to 20% in August and September. NHS: There was nothing for our NHS heroes. The Chancellor mentioned the Health Service only once and did not refer to social care. HOUSING: A new mortgage scheme will help people with small deposits. The Stamp Duty holiday was further extended. Nothing for builders. HIGH STREET: The Chancellor will allocate £1billion to regenerate 45 town centres in England to help them recover from Covid's impact. MINIMUM WAGE: The minimum wage will still be increased to £8.91 from April. It will mean a pay rise for more than two million workers. PENSIONS: Pensions lifetime, inheritance tax and capital gains tax allowances frozen. It will hit pensioners, investors and the grieving. BUSINESS: Firms will be able to claim back 130 per cent of investments in machinery, tools and IT equipment from their tax bill. VACCINE: Another £1.6billion will deliver more jabs to Brits. It will fund more than 100 mass vaccine centres and pay 80,000 workers. WORLD CUP: Rishi Sunak guaranteed £2.8million to bring football home and help Britain and Ireland's joint bid for the 2030 World Cup. GREEN: The first sovereign green bond could raise £15billion to beat climate change. Critics say not enough was done to help save the planet. LEVELLING UP: Eight free ports will be allocated in England, with many in Red Wall seats. Treasury offices will move to Darlington in Co Durham. UNIVERSAL CREDIT: The £20 uplift will stay in place for another six months. It is worth £1,000 a year to those on Universal Credit. FUEL DUTY: Fuel duty has been frozen again for a record 11th year. It came after The Sun led a decade-long Keep It Down campaign. RISHI Sunak has bet the farm on fuelling a historic two-year boom to bail out our broken economy. Provided inflation stays low, it's the right course. Even the Office for Budget Responsibility, not famous for its exuberant optimism, reckons we are poised to roar back — with FAR lower unemployment than first feared too. The Chancellor's Budget contained a blizzard of welcome tax breaks designed to transform post-Brexit, post-Covid Britain into a super-strength magnet for investment and jobs. And despite the almost unimaginable hole the pandemic has blown in the public finances, there were still nuggets for Sun readers to cheer. Mr Sunak froze duty on booze and, once again, on fuel –— another triumph for The Sun's decade-long campaign. We were spared rises in income tax, National Insurance and VAT rates. The living wage goes up. The Universal Credit increase is maintained for longer. Those still furloughed have a few more months' security. Likewise any self-employed still unable to work. Billions were splashed out in grants or tax breaks to shore up and revive crippled firms. There will be delight in the former Red Wall seats at the £1billion fund for regenerating towns — and in the eight sites for new, job-creating free ports. Some young house-hunters will rejoice at new Government-backed 95 per cent mortgages, though we do fear prices will soar ever higher without a vast increase in the supply of properties. But there was bleak news too. Our overall tax burden is ultimately poised to rise to its highest in decades. The freeze on tax thresholds from 2023 will hit millions. Mr Sunak justifiably claims no one will take home less than they do now, but the billions raised still come from workers' increasing wages. The sharp hike in corporation tax The Sun has warned against is coming too, but was wisely also postponed for two years and limited to the biggest firms. We hope Mr Sunak will in time revise it downwards. There is surely a risk, if investment is still pouring in, of slamming a brake on it. Official forecasts show depressingly flat growth beyond 2022 — but they may be pessimistic. No one can know how well the Chancellor's plan will work. What is certain is that Keir Starmer's, such as it is, would not. His priority, a pay rise for NHS workers, is a strange way to tackle a gargantuan debt whether you agree with it or not. The floundering Labour leader even resorted to resurrecting his failed ""circuit-breaker lockdown"" brainwave which Wales tested to destruction. Yes, it is tough to respond to a Budget. Even so, Starmer's vacuous riposte was one Jeremy Corbyn might have delivered. It really was that bad."
335,335,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor","Brits back Rishi Sunak’s Budget with more than half approving, poll reveals","RISHI Sunak's Budget was welcomed by Brits last night with more people thinking the policies announced were a good idea than bad, snap polling for The Sun showed. Pollsters Opinium found 52 per cent approve of the budget with 12 per cent disapproving – a net score of a whopping +40. And even controversial hikes to corporation tax and the freezing of income tax allowances were backed. 51 per cent thought the Budget was fair, with just 19 per cent thinking it is unfair. But less than one in five thought they would feel any positive effect on their household finances. 41 per cent approve of the way the government are handling the economy, compared to 35 per cent who disapprove – a net score of +6. Boris and Rishi have a 14 point lead when it comes to who the public most trust to run the nation's finances. But 64 per cent are worried about the state of the economy, an 44 per cent say it will only get worse next year. Most think it will take until 2023 to start improving. Last night Chris Curtis of Opinium said: ""Sunak has pulled together a set of economic policies that aren't just seen as being good for the economy but, unlike many previous Conservative budgets, a majority of voters also describe as being fair. ""First impressions don't always count for much with budgets, but for the moment at least, the Chancellor will be happy with the results showing a very positive initial reaction form the public."" Opinium surveyed 1,708 people online on Wednesday afternoon."
336,336,The Sun,Nick GutteridgeHarry ColeJonathan Reilly,Budget 2021: Rishi Sunak freezes fuel duty for 10th year running in huge win for Sun campaign,"RISHI Sunak today announced that fuel duty will be frozen for the TENTH year running in a major victory for the Sun's legendary Keep It Down campaign. The Chancellor confirmed tax on petrol and diesel won't be hiked as he delivered the details of his 2021 budget to the Commons. Unveiling the Budget Mr Sunak said: ""Right now, to keep the cost of living low, I'm not prepared to increase the cost of a tank of fuel. ""So the planned increase in fuel duty is also cancelled."" It comes after Boris Johnson told The Sun: ""I firmly believe that the economic recovery is going to be powered by white van man amongst others."" The hated levy has been frozen at 57.95p per litre after plans to hike it were abandoned amid fears it will punish drivers who are helping the country bounce back. At the weekend Mr Sunak insisted: ""I would like to be able to keep taxes low for people in general. ""I'm a conservative and I believe in that."" And a Treasury source said: ""Throughout this crisis the Chancellor has protected the wallets of hard working Sun readers and that will continue at this Budget and beyond."" The stunning victory for hard-pressed drivers - who already pay the most for at the pumps in Europe - comes after a decade of campaigning by Fair Fuel UK and Tory MPs led by powerful backbencher Robert Halfon. Mr Halfon said: ""A big thank you to the Sun Keep it Down campaign and Fair Fuel UK. And he said the move shows ""cutting the cost of living isn't just a slogan but a meaningful pledge from Boris."" ""Millions of motorists will breathe a big sigh of relief as the Chancellor has recognised their plight."" Howard Cox, Founder of FairFuelUK said: ""It would be churlish, not to thank the Chancellor and the Prime Minister for maintaining the freeze in Fuel Duty for a 10th successive year. ""It has been a tortuous journey convincing the Treasury year after year that this fiscal policy has positively benefitted the economy."" ""Motorists, van drivers and truckers across the UK will be pleased at this protracted decision from the Chancellor. ""They will hope this is just the start of more pro motoring policies, which have been sadly lacking in this Parliament."" Former Transport and Cabinet Minister, Chris Grayling welcomed the freeze adding:""We must remain on the side of the motorist. ""Most people depend on their cars to get to work and for their daily lives. Right now, with so many families under financial pressure, this would have been totally the wrong moment to push up their cost of living."" And Tory MP Julian Knight  said: ""I'm pleased given the war on motorists most left wing luvvies want us to declare, that the Chancellor has decided to bolster Britain by retaining the fuel duty freeze, now we need better roads, an end to punishing congestion charges, and an honest debate on the merits of cars and lorries."" WE are delighted Rishi Sunak has seen sense on freezing fuel tax, like three Tory Chancellors before him. They all liked to moan that The Sun's decade-long Keep It Down campaign cost them a fortune in lost revenue. It is only true if you disregard the savings drivers plough back into the economy. Hiking fuel tax in tomorrow's Budget would have been a brake on growth we can ill afford. Especially with Covid making Brits wary of public transport and even more dependent on their cars. It would have been a bitter blow to White Van Man too. We just hope Mr Sunak further agrees with the folly of raising taxes at all. As one economist after another is warning him, it just is not the moment."
337,337,The Sun,Natasha ClarkHarry ColeJonathan Reilly,Budget 2021: £2.8 million pledged for Britain’s bid to host 2030 World Cup,"MINISTERS have pledged £2.8 million in today's Budget towards a bid for Britain to host the World Cup in 2030. There will also be £25million in new funding from the Treasury to help the grassroots game grow - enough to build 700 new pitches. That will helps towards the government's plans to get Britain match fit for the future. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told MPs at the Budget today he was ""backing the UK and Ireland's joint 2030 World Cup bid."" Boris Johnson insisted in an interview with The Sun earlier this week: ""One of the things we want to do is we want to bounce back fitter. ""We want to bounce back better, but also we want to do much more to encourage sport in this country post pandemic."" And Mr Sunak will earmark a further £1.2million of new funding so that the Women's European Championships goes ahead in England in July 2022. It came after the PM offered up Britain's stadiums for the whole European Championships later this year - as the UK's vaccine roll-out surges ahead of the continent. And World Cup 1966 hero Sir Geoff Hurst backed the PM saying staging this summer's European championships here would bring joy to the country's pandemic-hit footie fans. The England hat-trick legend backed Boris's offer to host the entire tournament, due to be held across 12 countries. He told The Sun: ""I know a thing or two about the joy having a summer tournament on home soil can bring. ""Winning the World Cup as the home nation — I enjoy it daily. So let's recapture that spirit of '66 — we could all do with that now."" The football tournament's semi-finals and final are already pencilled in for Wembley in July but temporary teetotaller Mr Johnson said earlier this week: ""Any other matches they want hosted, we are certainly on for that!"" In an exclusive interview with The Sun, the Prime Minister said: ""We are very, very keen to bring football home in 2030. I do think it's the right place. ""It's the home of football, it's the right time. It will be an absolutely wonderful thing for the country."" Mr Johnson hopes the image of plucky Brexit Britain, fresh from its vaccine success, hosting the European tournament this summer would be a great advert for the UK's 2030 bid. And he hopes it will encourage us all to play more sport so the country can ""build back fitter"" from Covid. As well as pubs reopening in April, trials will begin into how best to get fans safely back into football grounds. With all Covid restrictions scheduled to be lifted by mid June, it is hoped that — with vaccine passports and mass-testing — Wembley could be at 90,000-capacity by the July finals. Ministers are in talks with UEFA amid fears the current plan to host the contest across 11 European cities will be sunk by soaring Covid cases across the Channel. We are very, very keen to bring football home in 2030. Mr Johnson said: ""We are hosting the Euros. We are hosting the semis and the final. ""If there's, you know, if they want any other matches that they want hosted, we're certainly on for that but at the moment that's where we are with UEFA."" And a summer of football this year would showcase Britain as the perfect venue for the World Cup in nine years' time."
338,338,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Budget 2021: Fears of lockdown FOUR as furlough is extended until September in Rishi Sunak’s Budget,"FEARS were today sparked of ANOTHER national lockdown as the furlough scheme is extended until September. According to Boris Johnson's lockdown plan, all Covid restrictions should be lifted by June 21. However, Rishi Sunak today revealed the government's furlough scheme had been extended until the end of September in his Budget - three months after all Brits were told the pandemic would be over. The Budget announcement means millions will have been paid to stay at home for 17 months by the end of the furlough scheme. The government will continue to pay furloughed workers' wages up to a maximum of £2,500 a month until the end of June. Employers will then be required to meet 10 per cent of those wages in July and 20 per cent in August and September as the scheme winds down. Mr Sunak told the Commons today: ""The furlough scheme will be extended until the end of September, there will be no changes to the terms. ""As businesses reopen, we'll ask them to contribute alongside the taxpayer to the cost of paying their employees. ""Nothing will change until July, when we will ask for a small contribution of just 10% and 20% in August and September."" But Brits took to social media concerned with the move, with one writing: ""Furlough ending in September… we're not being released in June are we!?! Lockdown 4.0 is imminent."" Another added: ""Furlough extended? Hello Lockdown 4.0."" A third wrote: ""They've just extended the furlough scheme until September. ""If we're lifting all restrictions on the 21st of June, why would we need a furlough scheme? Don't be surprised to see us in lockdown 4 by the 21st of June"" The Chancellor's vow ""to do whatever it takes"" to protect jobs and support businesses will add £5billion a month to the pandemic's £280billion support bill. But he also warned today that the time to get the nation's books in order is rapidly approaching. Mr Sunak is gambling on buying some time to allow the economic recovery to strengthen in order to weather the unemployment hit. The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has protected more than 11million jobs since its creation last March, with Mr Sunak promising further help in the ""challenging months ahead — and beyond"". Employees taking part will continue to receive 80% of their salary — up to a maximum £2,500 a month — for hours not worked until the scheme ends. Today's Budget also extended the Universal Credit uplift of £20 for six months and business support measures such as five per cent VAT for pubs and restaurants. The Chancellor also announced further support for the self-employed, with more than 600,000 people eligible for cash. A fourth grant from the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme is available from April, worth 80 per cent of three months' average trading profits up to £7,500. In his speech to MPs, Mr Sunak promised to help struggling workers with the ""full measure of our fiscal firepower"" but warn that the time is approaching to ""begin fixing the public finances"". He vowed to use every means ""to protect jobs and livelihoods"". But Mr Sunak is staring at a £400billion black hole created by the Covid crisis. He set out ""a three-point plan to protect jobs"" but also gave a reality check over the dire economic situation. The Treasury said the Budget will focus on ""support, honesty and building the future economy"". Mr Sunak told MPs: ""Once we are on the way to recovery, we will need to begin fixing the public finances — and I want to be honest today about our plans to do that."" It is hoped some of the money will be clawed back through a hike in corporation tax on businesses and capital gains taxes on millionaire second property owners and investors. Mr Sunak has also frozen the rates at which workers start to pay different levels of income tax, meaning more people will be caught in a higher band over the coming years. Last week, The Sun revealed he had been warned the deficit needs reducing by around £30-40billion now to stabilise borrowing and prevent debt from rising as a percentage of national income. THE Budget is when the government outlines its plans for tax hikes, cuts and things like changes to the minimum wage. It's different to the Spending Review, which sets out how much public cash will go towards funding certain departments, devolved government's and services, such as the NHS. The Budget is read out in the House of Commons by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It will be Rishi Sunak's second Budget as Chancellor. Mr Sunak's first one in March last year has been dubbed the ""coronavirus Budget"" after it focused on supporting Brits financially through the crisis, rather than the government's ""levelling up"" agenda as promised in the 2019 general election. Normally, the Budget is held once a year but the unprecedented circumstances of the pandemic in 2020 saw Mr Sunak give a ""mini-budget"" in the Commons on July 8 The CBI's chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said extending the furlough scheme will keep ""millions more in work and give businesses the chance to catch their breath"". She added: ""The furlough scheme has been a stand-out success. ""It's common sense to keep the scheme going while business resilience remains fragile."""
339,339,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Boris Johnson risks major row with MPs after China trade deal comments,"BORIS Johnson declared ""I am a Sinophile"" as he opened the door to a new free trade deal with China. In an interview with The Sun, the Prime Minister spoke of his love of the Oriental superpower and said any deal would be difficult  - but did not rule one out. The warm words will stun MPs given relations with Beijing are at a modern low over Hong Kong, human rights and the Covid outbreak. Mr Johnson said loving a country's history and culture was not the same as supporting its government and he insisted he ""disagreed vehemently"" with many of Beijing's actions. But asked if he could see a free trade deal with China during his premiership, the PM replied: ""We want to expand UK trade around the world."" Asked again, Mr Johnson replied: ""All trade deals are tough but I have great confidence in Liz Truss who has so far done 63 deals."" The comments last night sparked concern amongst Tory MPs who want the government to rule out any such trade deal with the brutal Beijing regime. They are furious over China's infringement of Hong Kong, Uighur slave camps and lying to the world about the outbreak Covid-19. Mr Johnson's pro-China rhetoric came amid growing confusion in Whitehall over whether the UK is pursuing a trade deal with the communist state or not. Business minister Lord Grimstone told peers in January: ""China is an important trading partner for the UK, and we are pursuing increased bilateral trade."" But last month Trade minister Greg Hands told the Commons ""we do not have a bilateral trade agreement with China… and we have no plans for a bilateral trade agreement with China."" Last night the Inter-Parliamentary Group on China, an anti-Beijing bloc of MPs, said: ""The Government need to come back to parliament and explain the reasons for this change in position."" Their spokesman added: ""The public have a right to know exactly how big the trade deal with China will be and when the PM will be signing it."" Speaking to The Sun on Monday, Mr Johnson also said he had seen ""no conclusive evidence"" of the theory pushed by the US State Department that the Covid pandemic was sparked after an accident at lab in Wuhan. But he urged the Chinese government to be more open about the early days of the bug. He said: ""It is very important that China should share with the world all the data about how the disease may or may not have originated. ""If it was a zoonotic disease, if it originated in a you know... I don't know, a meeting between a bat or a pangolin, or whatever, we need to know."" Mr Johnson was asked about reports he had recently told a group of business leaders that he was a ""Sinophile"" - someone who loves China. He replied: ""I am a Sinophile, but that's like saying I am a Russophile. I am a massive Russophile, I must be one of the few British PM's to be called Boris."" ""I think there's something about people's culture and civilisation that you can admire while disagreeing vehemently with things their governments do."""
340,340,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Budget 2021: Rishi Sunak prepares to extend furlough for months and give Universal Credit boost,"RISHI Sunak will support struggling Brits with the ""full measure of our fiscal firepower"" at tomorrow's Budget - but will warn the time is approaching to ""begin fixing the public finances."" The Chancellor will vow to use every tool in his box ""to protect the jobs and livelihoods of the British people"" - including months more furlough and extra Universal Credit. But with the nation's coffers reeling from the Covid crisis, Mr Sunak is staring at £400 billion blackhole on the eve of his second Budget. Tomorrow lunchtime the chief bean counter will set out ""a three-point plan to protect jobs"" - but also give the nation a reality check over the dire economic situation left in the wake of the pandemic. The Treasury said on Tuesday that the Budget will be focussed on ""support, honesty and building future economy."" Despite the mammoth deficit, the top Tory will promise to do ""whatever it takes"" to support the British people and business through this ""moment of crisis"" - including extending furlough and the Universal Credit £20 uplift for months more. Along with business support for struggling pubs and high streets, the Budget will likely see another £30 billion added to Britain's virus fighting tab. But Mr Sunak, who has only been in the job for a year, will also use his second Budget to begin to put the country on the long road back to balanced books. He will tell MPs: ""once we are on the way to recovery, we will need to begin fixing the public finances – and I want to be honest today about our plans to do that."" It is expected that will see a hike in corporation tax on businesses and capital gains taxes on millionaire second property owners and investors. It's also thought Mr Sunak will freeze the rates at which workers start to pay different levels of income tax, meaning more people will be caught in a higher band over the coming years. Last week The Sun revealed that Mr Sunak had been warned Britain's blackhole needs reducing by around £30-40billion now to stabilise borrowing and prevent debt from rising as a percentage of national income. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said: ""Even if the Government was comfortable with stabilising debt at 100 per cent of national income — its highest level since 1960 — it would still need a fiscal tightening worth 2.1 per cent of national income, or £43billion."" However it is hoped the success of the vaccine rollout will mean a swifter recovery, wit that figure reduced to some 29 billion. A full economic forecast will be published alongside the spending and taxing blueprint outlined by the Chancellor tomorrow lunchtime."

The PM admitted he is gasping for a pint at his local to toast the possibility of greater Euros involvement just as soon as the pubs are allowed to start serving again. Admitting he is currently ""on the wagon"", Mr Johnson said not being able to have a tipple during lockdown had been ""a nightmare"". He said that he would ""line up"" the pints at the first opportunity when pubs and restaurants are permitted to begin serving outside next month under his strict lockdown-easing policies. As well as pubs reopening in April, trials will begin into how best to get fans safely back into football grounds. We are very, very keen to bring football home in 2030. By Harry Cole BORIS Johnson showed off his painting skills to a class of key workers' kids yesterday ahead of schools returning next week. The Sun joined the PM at St Mary's Primary in Stoke-on-Trent, where he defended the pace of lockdown easing. He said: ""Education is the priority. Getting all schools open on March 8 is something we have set our hearts on for a long time."" With all Covid restrictions scheduled to be lifted by mid June, it is hoped that — with vaccine passports and mass-testing — Wembley could be at 90,000-capacity by the July finals. Ministers are in talks with UEFA amid fears the current plan to host the contest across 11 European cities will be sunk by soaring Covid cases across the Channel. Mr Johnson said: ""We are hosting the Euros. We are hosting the semis and the final.

And a summer of football this year would showcase Britain as the perfect venue for the World Cup in nine years' time. The Sun can reveal that Chancellor Sunak's Budget tomorrow will earmark £2.8million to promote the UK and Ireland's official pitch to FIFA to hold the tournament. There will also be £25million in new funding from the Treasury to help the grassroots game grow. It would be enough to fund around 700 new pitches across the UK. That will helps towards the government's plans to get Britain match fit for the future Mr Johnson insisted: ""One of the things we want to do is we want to bounce back fitter. ""We want to bounce back better, but also we want to do much more to encourage sport in this country post pandemic."" And Mr Sunak will earmark a further £1.2million of new funding so that the Women's European Championships goes ahead in England in July 2022. Mr Johnson said: ""We want to see a bonanza of football in the years ahead."" But he insisted that this summer's revelry would not be possible without the ""absolutely stunning"" ongoing success of the country's vaccine roll-out. Mr Johnson said he could ""only echo Her Majesty the Queen"" in her recent message for everyone to get jabbed. Ahead of the Budget, Mr Johnson said: ""The vaccination programme has given us a great deal more certainty than we might otherwise have had."" During a visit to St Mary's CE Primary School in Tunstall, Stoke-on-Trent, he added: ""I have no doubt that if we get it right, as I'm sure we can, we can have a strong, jobs-led recovery. ""I think that it could be much stronger than many of the pessimists have been saying over the last six months or so."" And he said the roll-out success had added certainty to his proposals from last month to ease the country out of lockdown. He said: ""It has given us a lot of assurances and credibility to some of the dates that we've set out. It's incredibly positive."" On the back of news that Britain's homegrown Oxford Astra-Zeneca vaccine is leading to declining deaths and hospitalisations from Covid, Mr Johnson teased France's President who had bad-mouthed the pioneering jab. Emmanuel Macron conducted a screeching U-turn this week after claiming that the jab was flawed. We want to see a bonanza of football in the years ahead. He now says he would definitely accept one if offered. Mr Johnson said he was delighted to see the Frenchman's embarrassing about turn. He said: ""I am thrilled the President of the French Republic has said would have one himself, that's very positive. It's very positive to see the endorsement."" And Mr Johnson swerved questions over whether he had called Mr Macron out on his claims that the Oxford jab was not suitable for over-65s. He would only say he has ""good relations"" with Mr Macron. It came amid rumours of a blazing behind-the-scenes row about his comment.

342,342,The Sun,Harry ColeJames Somper,France approves AstraZeneca vaccine for over-65s in embarrassing u-turn for Emmanuel Macron,"FRANCE has green lit the AstraZeneca jab for older people with underlying health issues in an embarrassing u-turn for Emmanuel Macron. Health minister Oliver Veran announced the decision after Mr Macron had originally claimed there was not enough data on the age group to allow older people to use it. The move - which will see those aged 65-74 with underlying health issues get the jab - comes after new data showed the effectiveness of the UK and Swedish-made vaccine. This is a humiliating blow for the embattled French President who drew heavy fire after claiming the remedy was ""quasi-ineffective"" for the elderly. Last night, Mr Véran told France Télévisions: ""The Haute Autorité de Santé now considers as of today that all three vaccines that we have in France have a remarkable efficacy to protect people against the risk of severe forms of Covid-19. ""As a result, I can announce that from now on everyone aged 50 and above who have comorbidities such as diabetes, high blood pressure or a history of cancer can be vaccinated with AstraZeneca without any age limits."" France's vaccination programme, along with Germany's, has been thrown into chaos as thousands have refused the remedy after Macron and Angela Merkel questioned its effectiveness. The new study, which promoted France's u-turn, shows a single shot of either the Oxford/AstraZeneca or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine cuts the risk of serious illness by more than 80 per cent. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock claimed that the new data was ""slightly better for the Oxford jab than for Pfizer"". Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England, said: ""I think in time the data emerging from the programme will speak for itself and other countries will doubtless be very interested in it."" The results and Veran's announcement could now increase pressure on Germany to authorise the jab for its over-65s. The vaccine – together with the Pfizer jab – has been used with great success in the UK to bring increasingly widespread protection to the population against Covid-19. On Friday more than 500,000 people were inoculated, bringing the total to almost 30 per cent of the adult population. And 20 million Brits have now received the first dose of the vaccine, which is now helping to bring dramatic reductions to numbers of deaths and hospitalisations. In Germany, 1.2million shots of the AstraZeneca vaccine are lying unused in storage after Merkel decided against using it on the country's pensioners. Carsten Watzl, of the German Society for Immunology, urged Merkel to re-think Germany's stance on the jab. He told BBC Radio 4: ""I think Germany will also reverse course soon. ""In order for us to reach our vaccination goals we need people to get this vaccine."" He also urged Merkel, 66, to have the jab live on television to prove it is safe. This comes as chancellor said on Thursday she would not take the vaccine because she is too old, despite saying ""it can be trusted."" Merkel told FAZ that she was not eligible because German regulators have restricted the jab to under-65s. ""In addition to the particularly vulnerable and elderly, I think it is correct to first invite population groups who cannot keep a distance in their jobs to be vaccinated,"" she said. ""A daycare educator, a primary school teacher cannot do that. These are the people who should get a turn before someone like me."""

Asked if he was planning a summer wedding, the PM told The Sun: ""The wedding industry is certainly gonna come roaring back in common with many other sectors of the economy."" The sound of wedding bells came after weeks of a Downing Street turf war which has seen hostile briefings aimed at Ms Symonds. But Mr Johnson rejected claims his team were at each others throats, instead describing No10 as a ""nest of singing birds"". However in a coded warning to the warring Tory tribes, the PM said the British public expect the government to be ""mono-maniacally"" dealing with the Covid pandemic. He said: ""I think what the people of this country want and deserve - and are getting - is a government totally focused on rolling out the vaccination programme that I think most impartial observers would say has been one of the fastest in the the world."" Downing Street has been at the centre of lurid briefing wars after the ousting of top aide Dominic Cummings, who had clashed with Ms Symonds. The PM declined to deny reports the couple's beloved rescue pup Dilyn had ""humped Dom's leg"" triggering a bout of internal civil war. Mr Johnson claimed: ""That is exactly the kind of question on which the people of this country are not focused."" All restrictions on weddings and the number of guests are currently due to be lifted in June under Mr Johnson's lockdown lifting roadmap."

Instead the PM argued the Covid crisis had actually boosted the case for Scotland and England sticking together. He told The Sun: ""The value of the Union has been massively underscored during this pandemic. ""I think most people looking at the way the UK has responded with the vaccine rollout can see the huge value of us working together as one United Kingdom. ""The UK armed forces and NHS distribution of the vaccine throughout one country has been fantastic,"" he added. Asked about SNP civil war engulfing the nationalist bigwigs Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon, Mr Johnson said: ""I think the biggest lesson I take from all this is that it's important in these times to focus on the issues that really matter to the people of Britain. ""The more I read about other stuff, the more convinced I am that that's what we should focus on."" The PM added: ""What the electorate in Scotland want is a government that focuses on their needs for education, fighting crime, governing sensibly with sensible policies on taxation and everything else. ""I don't see that from the Scottish National Party. I don't see that at all and I'd rather hold them to account for that."" And he said: ""The idea of having a referendum now, is absolutely extraordinary. ""Or having a referendum, anytime in the foreseeable future, given what this country's just been through and what we've got to do."""
345,345,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha Clark,Meat prices WON’T rise as Boris Johnson rules out tax hikes for Sun readers under his green agenda,"BORIS Johnson has vowed his green agenda will not lead to any new tax rises for hardworking Brits. Speaking exclusively to The Sun the Prime Minister said this year's Cop26 summit will not hit readers' wallets with new levies on meat or carbon  - but instead ""generate high quality, high skill, high wage jobs."" The PM wants the UK to be carbon neutral by 2050 to meet his eco-goals - but has yet to unveil a detailed plan to make it happen. Ministers are drawing up eco plans to bring to the table ahead of the UK hosting the UN's big climate change summit in Glasgow later this year. But there are fears that polluting taxes - currently only aimed at heavy industry, huge power generators and gas-guzzling airlines - will be extended to other parts of the economy that aren't eco-friendly too. Last month Downing Street distanced the PM from Whitehall plans for a meat tax - after MPs and experts rounded on the barmy plans. The row was sparked after Treasury ordered officials to come up with plans to slap charges on anything that requires high carbon emissions to produce. But asked specifically if there would be future meat or carbon taxes on consumers on his watch, Mr Johnson said: ""no."" Instead Mr Johnson said going green was ""an agenda for an economic bounce back that is built on the UK at the heart of a technological revolution as we were at the heart of the Industrial Revolution 200 years ago."" Speaking to The Sun during a visit to a primary school in Stoke-on-Trent on Wednesday afternoon, the PM claimed: ""200 years ago the West Midlands was the centre for iron and steel making and all the rest of it."" ""Coke fired iron was originally the green technology - using coke was the cleaner alternative. And it was pioneered in this country. ""So green technology, going forward with the green option, is very often the best way to drive, drive jobs, and drive the economy."" Setting out his green vision he added: ""We can be the centre of battery manufacturing, we can be the centre of  battery innovation in this part of the world. And as I say the Saudi Arabia of wind. That's our ambition. ""Yes of course it also it's also good for the environment, yes it helps us to reduce CO2. ""It will leave a cleaner, greener planet, for our children and grandchildren. That's great. ""But it's also integral to our economic recovery."" MAKING simple everyday changes can add up to a BIG difference to the planet.

The PM is adamant businesses should not be able to discriminate against people who have not had the vaccine. Mr Johnson made his views clear to cabinet ministers and aides who are working on a review of controversial Covid-status certificates. He says workers may have legitimate reasons for not being inoculated. Business leaders, such as Pimlico Plumbers boss Charlie Mullins, have vowed not to hire anyone who has not had the jab. But a Whitehall source said: ""The idea of having a vaccine certificate to do an honest day's work doesn't sit right with a lot of people inside government, including the Prime Minister."" ""The reviews taking place are as much about kicking these ideas out, as much as implementing them. ""The Prime Minister does not want to see people punished for not having had the jab for possibly legitimate reasons."" It comes as the PM said Brits will be ""consumed with desire"" to get back to face-to-face meetings when the nation opens up."
347,347,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Jihadi bride Shamima Begum could RETURN to UK if government is defeated in Supreme Court today,"MINISTERS fear a possible Supreme Court defeat today which would pave the way for runaway jihadi bride Shamima Begum's UK return. The Government has fought to stop her being granted the right to come back to appeal after she was stripped of her British passport. Begum was 15 when she left Bethnal Green in East London and married an IS terrorist in Syria. Then-Home Secretary Sajid Javid tore up her citizenship on national security grounds when she was discovered pregnant in a refugee camp in 2019. Now 21, she has been stuck in northern Syria ever since. The Court of Appeal last year said she should be allowed home to pursue her appeal. Ministers challenged it in the highest court of the land, which presents its judgement today. Priti Patel said Begum coming back to the UK ""would create significant national security risks"" and expose the public to ""an increased risk of terrorism"". Government lawyer Sir James Eadie QC told the court the intelligence assessments gauged that Begum presented a serious threat ""justifying the removal of her British citizenship and … the placing of serious impediments in the way of her return to the UK"". He added: ""She is assessed to pose a real and current threat to national security. She is aligned with Isis. ""During the four years she has spent in Islamic State territory she had undergone radicalisation and 'desensitisation to violence'."" The Supreme Court's verdict was last night shrouded in secrecy with the Home Office refused early sight of the judges' decision."

The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation will confirm the priority order of the next phase of vaccines that will not take into account any professions. Ministers aim to have all UK adults jabbed by July, and the next cohorts will be those 49 to 40, then 39 - 30 and all under 30s. Under 18s are not approved for the jab yet. Last night a Health source confirmed pressure from some ministers, MPs, unions and senior cops to allow some workers to be jabbed first had not be successful.

The former PM compared the Covid crisis to a wartime situation that means the Chancellor should cast normal spending rules out the window. And he also threw his weight behind the possibility of using vaccine passports to help businesses reopen and recover from the lockdown. He told CNN that circumstances today are ""very different"" to the ones he inherited in the aftermath of the 2008 banking crash. And he said: ""Piling tax increases on top of that before you've even opened up the economy wouldn't make any sense at all. ""I think it's been right for the government here in the UK and governments around the world to recognise this is more like a sort of wartime situation."" Mr Cameron said it's right the Government is looking into the possibility of using vaccine passports to get business going again. He said: ""If we want to open up our economy as rapidly as possible, I think there'll be a number of different ways and places where people will want to know 'have you been vaccinated' before you join this event, this party, this whatever. ""So, I think it's coming, and I'm very glad that the government is having a serious think about all the moral and ethical and legal dilemmas. They should not close their mind to this."" In a rare public intervention the ex Tory PM also warned some trade disruption from Brexit will be permanent. He said: ""What we're seeing now is both some early problems that need to be addressed, but some of them are the consequence of being outside of the single market. ""I hope the government can address as many of the problems and issues as possible, whether that's problems faced by British fishermen, whether it's small businesses finding it more difficult to export to EU countries because of the additional bureaucracy. ""I hope they can tackle as many of these problems as possible, but ultimately some of them are because we chose to leave the single market and become a third country."" Insiders are calling it ""two big slices of bread with very thin jam"". His remarks come after The Sun revealed Mr Sunak's budget next week will be an expensive and painful sandwich of giveaways and tax hikes. Slice one is a £30billion Covid support bundle that will see furlough, business relief, the Universal Credit uplift and stamp duty holiday all extended to June. Doing this for three months more, to bring those measures in line with the Government's programme for coming out of lockdown, leaves ""thin jam"" — or little to spend elsewhere. Slice two is a painful package of tax hikes to start raising billions to close the UK's budget deficit, which will hit £400billion by April. Experts say that needs reducing by around £30-40billion now to stabilise borrowing and prevent debt from rising as a percentage of national income. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said: ""Even if the Government was comfortable with stabilising debt at 100 per cent of national income — its highest level since 1960 — it would still need a fiscal tightening worth 2.1 per cent of national income, or £43billion."" In a bid to prove to the world that Britain's spending is not out of control, Chancellor Mr Sunak will likely announce a hike in corporation taxes — up to as much as 25 per cent from 19 per cent over a number of years. Raising capital gains will target the rich, such as second-home owners. A government source said: ""Action needs to be taken now, not in November and not next year, but now. ""The Budget will make a start on that stabilisation. It can't go the whole way in one fiscal event but it will make a start."" Covid spending means ""thin jam"" for other giveaways. Mr Sunak is under pressure to keep the freeze on fuel duty rises and give a lockdown recovery gift of slashed booze levies plus allocating cash for infrastructure plans in the North. Labour has insisted: ""Now is not the time for tax rises for families or businesses."" WE couldn't believe our ears. Who was this politician yesterday, soundly agreeing with The Sun that ""now is not the time for tax rises for businesses""? None other than Sir Keir, the Starmer chameleon. A little more than a year ago,  this same man campaigned to install  mega-taxing, business-wrecking, Brexit- reversing Marxists in Downing Street. Yet here he was, for once making sense. Sadly, Chancellor Rishi Sunak seems focused on tax hikes to whittle down the vast Covid debt. We sympathise. But we're not minded to back any. We will shed the fewest tears about owners of multiple homes paying more capital gains tax when they flog them. But increasing corporation tax now, when Britain desperately needs firms to create jobs and growth, is madness. Does it not bother the Treasury to be plotting tax rises even Labour baulks at? Pleas not to hike fuel duty — backed by The Sun's Keep It Down crusade — come as a new eco-petrol is sanctioned for use at UK pumps.

350,350,The Sun,Harry ColeLevi Winchester,Rishi Sunak set to extend furlough and Universal Credit support – but tax hikes are coming too,"CHANCELLOR Rishi Sunak is set to extend furlough and the Universal Credit uplift - but painful tax hikes are on the cards too. Insiders have described the Budget next week as a sandwich of good and bad news for families. Some have likened it to ""two big slices of bread with very thin jam"". The first piece is a £30billion coronavirus support bundle that will see furlough, business relief, the Universal Credit uplift and stamp duty holiday all extended until June. The Sun has previously reported how furlough will carry on beyond its April deadline to help the millions of people still unable to work. The Universal Credit uplift of £20 per week, amounting to £1,040 for families over the year, was also reported to be likely to remain in place beyond April as coronavirus rules are still in force. ITV's Peston reports that an extension could be granted for six months. Meanwhile, the Chancellor has come under pressure to extend stamp duty by families who have been left scrambling to complete their transactions before the deadline of March 31. THE Budget is when the government outlines its plans for tax hikes, cuts and things like changes to the minimum wage. It's different to the Spending Review, which sets out how much public cash will go towards funding certain departments, devolved government's and services, such as the NHS. The Budget is read out in the House of Commons by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It will be Rishi Sunak's second Budget as Chancellor. Mr Sunak's first one in March last year has been dubbed the ""coronavirus Budget"" after it focused on supporting Brits financially through the crisis, rather than the government's ""levelling up"" agenda as promised in the 2019 general election. Normally, the Budget is held once a year but the unprecedented circumstances of the pandemic in 2020 saw Mr Sunak give a ""mini-budget"" in the Commons on July 8. But this package of support, to bring those measures in line with the roadmap for coming out of lockdown, leaves ""thin jam"" — or little to spend elsewhere. Slice two is a package of tax hikes to start raising billions to close the UK's budget deficit, which will hit £400billion by April. Experts say this budget deficit needs to be reduced by £30billion to £40billion to stabilise borrowing and prevent debt from rising. The Chancellor will likely announce a hike in corporation taxes — up to as much as 25% from 19% over a number of years. Raising capital gains will target the rich, such as second-home owners. Paul Johnson, head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, previously warned how families will be hit by tax rises to pay for the Covid-shaped hole in the accounts. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said: ""Even if the Government was comfortable with stabilising debt at 100% of national income — its highest level since 1960 — it would still need a fiscal tightening worth 2.1% of national income, or £43billion."" But coronavirus spending means ""thin jam"" for other giveaways. Mr Sunak is under pressure to keep the freeze on fuel duty rises, while the Chancellor is said to be considering cutting alcohol duty. Boris Johnson was urged by MPs yesterday to instead slap the tax on supermarket booze instead. The move could see 14p added to the price of a supermarket can and 36p knocked off the cost of a pint down the pub. Meanwhile, more than two dozen Tory MPs have written to Mr Sunak urging him not to raise fuel tax in his Budget. The Conservative Party had a manifesto commitment, called the ""triple tax lock"", that pledged to not raise the rates of income tax, national insurance or value added tax. Mr Sunak is reported to want to keep to this, according to the Financial Times, but any changes - if any - won't be confirmed until the Budget. We round up everything we know so far about what could be included in the Budget 2021. Mr Sunak's first Budget in March last year was dubbed the ""coronavirus Budget"" after it focused on supporting Brits financially through the crisis. Normally, the Budget is held once a year but the unprecedented circumstances of the pandemic in 2020 saw Mr Sunak give a ""mini-budget"" in the Commons on July 8."

353,353,The Sun,Jonathan ReillyHarry Cole,"Wembley Stadium to hold 90,000 fans for Euros final under plans to use the NHS app to show who is vaccinated","WEMBLEY Stadium will be packed with 90,000 fans for the Euros final under plans to use the NHS app to show who is vaccinated. Ministers want to fill the home of football on July 11 to show off Brexit Britain's storming jab-driven recovery. Hundreds of thousands of Brits could also be set to enjoy a great summer of sport and live music with the Wimbledon tournament, cricket Tests and the Leeds and Reading Festivals saved. Ministers are hopeful of packing out stadia and live venues later this year using the NHS app to prove people have been jabbed or tested negative for Covid. On the back of the policy shift toward vaccine passports, The Sun has learnt Whitehall Officials are working on secret tech plans to add them to the app. And the jewel in the crown would be a full house at Wembley for the final of the delayed Euro 2020 tournament in July. Boris Johnson said yesterday he was ""very optimistic"" all restrictions would be lifted by June 21 and threw his weight behind vaccine passports being used at home as well as abroad. He said ""none of this would have been possible"" without the NHS jab rollout and hinted it had opened ""immense possibilities"". Tennis fans will be watching closely to see if they can get to watch live matches at Wimbledon, which starts on June 28. England play India in cricket Tests in August and Reading and Leeds festivals are also scheduled for the end of the month. The Sun understands a vaccine passport function could be added to the existing NHS Covid app, which has already been downloaded 20 million times by Brits. A source said: ""There are people actively working on adding it as a function. It would be the easiest thing to do as so many people already have it. ""The app's been seen as a bad thing — that you might get pinged — but this usage would definitely be for good."" Ministers want to show off to the world how our vaccination drive has been a huge success. Department of Culture, Media and Sport officials are drawing up plans for mass events, one of the reviews announced by Mr Johnson on Monday. It will include building on the work already done at pilot events last summer and analysis of fans attending Covid-compliant football grounds and audiences in virus safe theatres last year. The app's been seen as a bad thing — that you might get pinged — but this usage would definitely be for good. They will also examine how mass testing can be used to control the spread of the virus when several thousand people head to an event — alongside the possible use of vaccine certificates. Officials will also look at the vaccinated fan thresholds — allowing them to potentially declare a venue safe if a certain percentage of the crowd has been jabbed. Fans will also be encouraged to drive, walk or cycle to venues, rather than use public transport. Festivals or non-seated events will be harder to get the green light for but officials say they hope to restart them. The news comes as Mr Johnson faced mounting pressure to speed up his plans, with even one of his gloomiest experts saying he could go faster. In a break from his usual naysaying, lockdown architect Professor Neil Ferguson broke cover to declare: ""If we're in a best case scenario where vaccine effectiveness is greater than estimates . . . there's always the potential of accelerating rate of relaxation."" No10 is resisting any notion of going faster. But the Imperial College professor's comments delighted Tory MPs who are eyeing up weeks of Parliamentary warfare to quicken the process of releasing us from lockdown. Instead, Mr Johnson revealed he had asked senior minister Michael Gove to lead a review into what he called the ""deep and complex issues"" surrounding Covid status certificates in a bid to save summer. Combining the jab with testing was understood to be one option being considered by ministers to avoid discriminating against those who decline the vaccination for health, or other, reasons. THE Grand National should be bumped back by a week so that punters can have a flutter in a betting shop. The Betting and Gaming Council wants authorities to delay the race from April 10, which is two days before bookies are due to reopen. About £125million is staked on the Aintree spectacular, which was cancelled last year, with many people making their only bet of the year. Michael Dugher, chief exec of the BGC, said: ""This would also provide a much-needed and timely boost for racing and the high street after such a torrid year for both."" The Jockey Club, which runs Aintree, declined to comment. Speaking on a visit to South London, Mr Johnson acknowledged that ""fervent libertarians"" would hate the idea of a vaccine passport but said others would ""think there's a case for it"". But he warned: ""We can't be discriminatory against people who for whatever reason can't have the vaccine."" He added that Mr Gove, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, would lead a review, ""getting the best scientific, moral, philosophical, ethical viewpoints on it and will work out a way forward""."
354,354,The Sun,Harry Cole,More than two dozen Tory MPs urge Rishi Sunak not to raise fuel tax in Budget,"MORE than two dozen Tory MPs have written to Rishi Sunak urging him not to raise fuel tax in his Budget. They say Boris Johnson made a pledge in 2019 not to increase the hated levy and breaking the vow would betray voters. The 26 Conservatives - including former ministers Tracey Crouch, Esther McVey, David Davis and Iain Duncan Smith said Brits pay more at the pumps than anywhere in the EU. The 58p-a-litre levy is in the Chancellor's sights - with as much as a 5p rise being considered - to help plug the Covid black-hole next week. But the letter shows Downing Street faces a major rebellion on Mr Sunak's Budget if drivers are targeted. The warning shot was organised by Rob Halfon MP and Howard Cox, of Fair Fuel UK - who have been working with The Sun to ""Keep It Down"" for a decade. It says the move would ""create significant economic difficulties"" for millions. The letter says analysis by the Centre for Economics and Business Research shows ""a hike of 2p would cut GDP by £600million, reduce employment by 8,000 jobs and add 0.6% to inflation"". THE new unemployment figures should send a chill down Rishi Sunak's spine. His upcoming Budget could so easily make matters worse. The Chancellor is focused on jobs, and rightly so. But almost every day brings a new leak of a worrying Treasury plan to raise this tax or that. Our views on the madness of hammering working people with extra fuel duty are well known. But hiking corporation tax from the low levels which helped the Tories conjure a job-creation miracle in the last recession is similarly crazy. Unemployment is at a five-year high. Once the furlough ends, the dole queue is likely to lengthen dramatically. Mr Sunak must learn from history. In the decades after World War Two, the US and West Germany encouraged the free market with lower taxes and far less state intervention. Britain maintained high taxes and a big state controlling vast swathes of the economy. America prospered. West Germany rose from its ruins to become Europe's powerhouse. By the 1970s, Britain was Europe's basket case, begging a handout from the International Monetary Fund. In the post-Covid era we could raise taxes, maintain the State at pandemic emergency levels, as Labour would love, and entrench our decline for decades. Instead we must use low taxes to create jobs, investment and growth and capitalise on our new independence outside the EU. Last night, Mr Halfon said: ""If the Government needs funds, it should tax millionaires, rather than millions of hard-working Brits."" Howard Cox added: ""Truckers and van drivers are the solution to get back to sanity. ""Burdening them with more costs will risk economic recovery and those new red-wall Tory voters will suffer the far-reaching increases in shop prices and loss of jobs."""

Mr Johnson will add: ""Unlike many issues the council deals with,  this is one we know exactly how to address."" He will urge action to help vulnerable countries adapt to climate change, cut pollution and greenhouse gases and so protect biodiversity, prosperity and security.

356,356,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha ClarkJonathan Reilly,Boris sets England on snail-paced return to freedom with restrictions not fully lifted until at least June 21,"BORIS Johnson set England on a snail-paced return to freedom with Covid restrictions not fully lifted until  June 21 at the very earliest. The PM dismayed many hoping for a return to more normal life, including his own Tory MPs, with an ultra-cautious reopening blueprint. Read our UK lockdown live blog for the latest news and updates on Boris' roadmap... At a press conference tonight he insisted the extraordinarliy successful vaccines program would throw a ""shield"" round the entire population. Boris vowed: ""There is light ahead, leading us to a spring and the summer, which I think will be seasons of hope, looking and feeling incomparably better for us all and from which we will not go back."" The blueprint will see pub gardens, hairdressers, gyms and shops shut until April 12 — another 48 days. Families and friends will have to wait even longer, until  May 17, to hug one another or stay overnight in each other's homes. And it will be a total of 118 days before we reach June 21 — the  earliest date all restrictions will be lifted in what is already being  dubbed ""independence day"". Social distancing and masks could still be used for months more and vaccine passports may be required for a full return to normality,  as the PM warned we must learn to live with the virus forever. But he insisted ""the end really is in sight"" and ""a wretched year will soon give way to spring and summer  very different to today"". Warning that he has put ""certainty over urgency"", Mr Johnson's ultra-cautious four-step plan will see restrictions reviewed every five weeks from March 8, with  only gradual unlocking at each stage. Groups of six, or two households of any size, can meet outside from the end of next month, and indoors from May but people are warned not to hug anyone outside their household until after a review of social distancing rules. Mr Johnson told MPs desperate for a speedier plan he would ""not take the risk"" of a fourth crippling lockdown but instead ""guide us cautiously but irreversibly towards reclaiming our freedoms"". Speaking earlier in the Commons, the PM said he understood the public's frustrations at the glacial pace. He added: ""And I sympathise very much with the exhaustion and the stress that people are experiencing and businesses are experiencing… but to them I say the end really is in sight."" In a long-awaited day of revelations, Mr Johnson confirmed: Leaders in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales will be announcing their own approaches separately. Patrick Vallance hailed ""the miracle of the vaccine"" as ""extraordinary"" and said it was the key to unlocking life as we know it - citing positive data from Israel leading the way. He added: ""It is an extraordinary bedrock of success to think about moving to normality."" He admitted it was possible that ""coming into next winter"" it may be needed to wear masks again, and that hand washing, and test and trace should still be in place. And the PM's own roadmap admitted that it would cause thousands more deaths as the country opens up once again. Tonight Chris Whitty said this evening that Britain would not ""get rid"" of Covid and it would cause problems for ""at least the next few winters"". He warned: ""This is not the end."" Everyone must stick to the rules as they are relaxed or cases will spike again, he begged. All restrictions will be lifted at the same time across England - with no more tiers in sight - but each step will be assessed against four tests first. And as long as the data allows and there are no more new variants which could wreck the plans, the PM aims to review and relax more rules every five weeks giving a week's notice of the update. It comes as Public Health England findings showed that one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine reduces hospitalisations and deaths by at least 75 per cent - which will help him lift measures. And Mr Johnson hinted that furlough would be extended further, saying that he would do whatever it takes to continue to provide support for people throughout the pandemic and ""the rug will not be pulled out"". But the PM also said there could be ""no credible world to a zero Covid Britain"" and insisted there would still be some form of the virus existing for months to come. MPs will get a vote on the new rules - before March 29 - where grumpy Tory backbenchers are likely to urge him to go even further. The PM had faced pressure to act even faster from his backbenchers, who want all rules to be ditched by the end of April, but he's said it won't be safe to do so. The plan will come as part of three stages - which can't be pulled forward. Those are the dates which will be the earliest ones possible, but they could slide backwards. If one date is dragged back, they will all be dragged back. He also confirmed today that shielding Brits have been told to stay home as much as they can until the end of March. This assessment will be based on four tests: The news also came as Boris announced a review into vaccine passports - and whether ""covid status certifications"" will be able to help Britain out of lockdown. The u-turn comes after ministers spending months denying they will be used here in the UK, and will only be signed off by GPs so that people can go abroad. According to Boris' plan, Brits have been warned to continue socially distance - as they have done for months in an attempt to stop the spread of Covid. However, with the successful rollout of the Covid vaccination, the Government has said the public will be able to make informed personal decisions. In the roadmap, Brits are told: ""It will remain important for people toconsider the risks for themselves, taking into account whether they and those they meet have been vaccinated or are at greater risk."" The roadmap released today states: ""The Government will continually review the evidence of vaccine efficacy, including its impact on transmission. ""As soon as possible, and no later than Step 3, the Government will update its advice on social distancing between friends and family, including hugging. ""Until then, people should continue to keep their distance from anyone not in their household or support bubble, and keep up habits such as regular hand washing and letting in fresh air."" Ministers will also conduct a review into social distancing, leaving the door open to masks and the one metre plus rule staying in place for months to come. There's currently no date when those rules may end - but today's roadmap makes clear they will be in place until at least June. Working from home should also continue for months to come. And ministers will also pilot events with no social distancing too. Boris Johnson also confirmed new rules for pubs, with the 10pm curfew ditched when they reopen. People won't need to buy a meal in order to have a pint. But they will be restricted to table service for the forseeable future. More testing will allow the nation to get back to normal too, he said. Nightclubs and other venues like sports may use mass testing to start bigger events up again. A review will look at how best to get back to normal as soon as they can. The PM said local lockdowns may be needed in future to control any new variants. Postcode testing is currently in place in a dozen areas across the country where new types of the virus have been found. Brits won't find out until April 12 if they'll be going on holiday abroad this summer. The Prime Minister announced today that the government would not make any decision until April - and that trips abroad will definitely be no earlier than May 17. For those looking to holiday in England, self-catered holidays will restart from April 12 which includes caravans and holiday lets, as long as it is with your own household only. Hotels and mixed-group holidays will be able to resume from May 17, but only for two households, or more than two households with the rule of six. From June 21, three households will be able to go away together even if it is more than the rule of six - as they hope to lift all the rules by then. MARCH 29: APRIL 12 MAY 17: JUNE 21:"

Britain has re-joined the UN Human Rights Council as a voting member. And the Foreign Secretary has been preparing a full-on verbal assault on both China and Russia to mark the occasion. He will brand Communist superpower China ""beyond the pale"" in a dramatic upping of hostility. And he will savage Russia's poisoning and jailing of opposition leader Alexei Navalny. On China, he will use his virtual address to the global peacekeeping council to say: ""The reported abuses — which include torture, forced labour and forced sterilisation of women — are extreme and they are extensive. ""They are taking place on an industrial scale. UN mechanisms must respond."" Mr Raab will pile pressure on President Vladimir Putin over his treatment of opposition in Russia, saying: ""It is disgraceful that Navalny, himself the victim of a despicable crime, has now been sentenced on arbitrary charges. ""His treatment and the violence inflicted on peaceful protesters can only further reinforce the world's concerns that Russia is failing to meet its international obligations."" Although China and Russia are rotating members of the Human Rights Council, they do not have vetos, unlike on the UN Security Council. Mr Raab will also demand the Myanmar military coup bosses step aside and release the country's elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, after a bloody crackdown on protests."
358,358,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",UK lockdown roadmap: Boris Johnson to unveil ‘cautious’ plan to freedom but could slam on brakes if key tests aren’t met,"BORIS Johnson will today unveil his March to Freedom — with loved ones able to meet outdoors and kids back in classrooms from next month. The national stay-at-home order is to be scrapped as the Rule of Six returns in late March, with sports back on as part of a four-step plan to ease lockdown. The Prime Minister will publish storming data that shows the vaccine rollout has led directly to tumbling deaths and hospital cases. His blueprint will see lockdown eased in four steps — with four key tests applied to each stage of the way to freedom. Mr Johnson will warn that for each step to be taken, benchmark numbers will need to be met on: He will reserve the right to slam the brakes on lifting lockdown if a new variant of the virus emerges. Regional tiers have been ditched and all of England will begin the phased return to normality. Today I'll be setting out a roadmap to bring us out of lockdown cautiously. Our priority has always been getting children back into school which we know is crucial for their education and wellbeing. We'll also be prioritising ways for people to reunite with loved ones safely. Step One will see kids return to classrooms on March 8 and ""ways for people to reunite with loved ones safely"" prioritised. Three weeks later, on March 29, the ""Rule of Six"" will return to parks and private gardens — allowing six people from up to six different households to mix outdoors. If just two households come together they can meet with no cap on their size. This means families will be meeting together in parks and gardens by Easter. Phase one of the plan was confirmed by Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi this morning. He said schools will reopen on March 8, at which point two people will also be allowed to meet up outdoors ""to address some of the issues around loneliness"". Then on March 29 two households of any size, or the rule of six, will also be able to gather outside. Mr Zahawi revealed families who live far apart will be able to travel across the country to meet outdoors from that date. And he outside confirmed sports, such as tennis and golf, will also return then. But those desperate for a haircut have to wait at least seven weeks for salons to reopen. It will be Mid-April before they are unlocked along with non-essential shops, while restaurants and pubs will be able to serve customers outdoors. The rest of restrictions will be eased in May and June with inside mixing and drinking — with the hope of normality by July, when every adult will have been offered a Covid jab first dose. Last night the PM said: ""Our decisions will be made on the latest data at every step. ""We will be cautious about this approach so that we do not undo the progress we have achieved so far and the sacrifices each and every one of you has made to keep yourself and others safe. ""We have therefore set four key tests which must be met before we can move through each step of the plan. I'll be setting out a roadmap to bring us out of lockdown cautiously."" He added: ""Our priority has always been getting children back into school, which we know is crucial for their education as well as their mental and physical well-being. ""And we will also be prioritising ways for people to reunite with loved ones safely."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there will be ""weeks between the steps"" — so ministers can ""watch carefully"" the impact of each relaxation of the restrictions. The first step on March 8 sees all kids back at school — with details of mass testing due in the roadmap. Two adults will also be allowed to socialise in a park from that date. Then to herald the start of the Easter holidays, outdoor sports like golf and tennis will also be allowed — alongside a return to organised sports such as football for children and adults alike. It is understood that hairdressers will finally be unlocked sometime between April 12 and 19. Last night Mr Johnson was under pressure to go even quicker than his proposed blueprint. In a boost to Tory backbenchers, who are pushing for faster moves, ex-party leader William Hague said the majority of lockdown measures should end after all the over-50s have been jabbed in April. The former Foreign Secretary said there would not be ""much justification"" to continue restrictions after the vaccination of the most vulnerable. Forty Tory MPs from the backbench Covid Recovery Group have signed a letter demanding Mr Johnson advances the opening of pubs and restaurants to the beginning of April — in time for Easter. The group's boss Mark Harper said: ""Britain's hospitality industry has had one of the toughest years on record and it's vital we do everything we can to get them open in a Covid-secure way that allows them to protect jobs and operate viably."" But last night government sources said the plea was likely to fall on deaf ears. Following a two-hour meeting of Mr Johnson's Covid war committee yesterday, one source said: ""That's it, it's locked in now."" Meanwhile, Richard Lambert, chief executive of the National Hair and Beauty Federation, said the personal care sector needs government cash aid now and when they re-open to keep businesses afloat. He added: ""There is nothing coming in and overheads have to be paid."" He added that a targeted VAT cut would allow them to re-build and invest in staff. Another 215 Covid deaths were recorded in the UK yesterday bringing the total to 120,580. A further 9,834 cases were confirmed."
359,359,The Sun,Harry Cole,Tory minister Penny Mordaunt rapped after boasting about meeting with boycotted Muslim group,"A TOP Tory minister has been slapped down after boasting she sat down with a boycotted Muslim group. Ex-Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt met the Muslim Council of Britain on Friday. This was despite an existing ""non-engagement"" policy for ministers towards the group since 2009. The MCB has been the centre of controversy despite claiming to be the UK's main ""national representative Muslim body"". It has been criticised as not being reflective of the Muslim community. The last Labour government cut ties with the group after a leading member signed a declaration calling for acts of violence against Israel. But Ms Mordaunt infuriated No10 and the Home Office over the talks with new secretary-general Zara Mohammed. The Paymaster General posted: ""Great to have met with Zara today, to wish her success and hear more about her plans, look forward to working with her."" But a Government spokesperson said it ""has a long-standing policy of not engaging with the MCB and that has not changed."" A source claimed Ms Mordaunt linked up with the MCB ""in her capacity as a constituency MP"". But Dr Alan Mendoza, of the Henry Jackson Society think-tank, called the meeting ""shocking"". Ms Mordaunt did not respond to requests for comment. The MCB said it was ""delighted"" with the meeting. A MCB spokesperson said: ""Our door always remains open to anyone who wishes to work with us. ""It is for the government to confirm if and why they are pursuing a policy of non-engagement with the Muslim Council of Britain. If they are, the question arises whether similar faith-based, democratic bodies are excluded in this way. ""The election of Zara Mohammed - the youngest and first woman Secretary General of the MCB - represents an opportunity for both the MCB and the government to come together and discuss areas where we could work together for the common good. We were delighted that Penny Mordaunt did exactly that."""
360,360,The Sun,Harry Cole,Lockdown roadmap – Huge boost for schools return on March 8 as Labour leader Sir Kier Starmer defies unions to back plan,"BORIS Johnson's hopes of getting all school kids back in classrooms on 8 March handed a huge boost after Labour boss Sir Keir Starmer defied his union paymasters to back the plan. The Prime Minister is preparing a major school safety campaign this week to convince parents children are safe, despite nine teaching unions saying they want a staggered return. He will also unveil millions in support for a major catch up push and a Covid mass-testing regime for all schools to follow in the coming days. But a fresh bout Labour civil war exploded once again after Sir Keir threw his weight behind a ""big bang"" opening - to the fury of left-wingers in his party. And they were backed by the Archbishop of Canterbury who said he was ""absolutely sure"" the government was right to prioritise the reopening of schools, saying: ""That is probably the most urgent thing, it's been the most urgent thing right the way through."" It came as it emerged pupils will be given extra classes during the summer holidays to help them catch up with lessons missed during the pandemic. Speaking on Sunday morning, Sir Keir told Sky News: ""Ideally, I'd like to see all schools back open on 8th March and all children back in school on March 8. ""I've been worried through the pandemic, a number of people have, about the impact that being out of school has on particularly vulnerable children and the attainment gap is getting bigger, so ideally March 8. ""We'll have to see obviously where the data is, see where the science is, but that's what we should be working towards. ""If that means more testing, if that means Nightingale classrooms, if it means other measures, let's do that because I want to get our kids back into school. But that flew in the face of a joint statement from the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), the NAHT school leaders' union, the National Education Union (NEU), the NASUWT teachers' union, the National Governance Association (NGA), the Sixth Form Colleges Association (SFCA) and Labour-affiliated unions Unison, Unite and GMB. They all said school return should be staggered by year group and called Mr Johnson's plan ""reckless"". Unison, Unite and GMB are also major donors to the Labour party. And former Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell also took to the airwaves on Sunday morning to demand that Labour ""listen to the unions."" MATT Hancock has again rejected calls for teachers to be given priority for a Covid jab before schools return. Boris Johnson is tomorrow expected to announce schools will reopen from March 8 after kids were forced to study from home during the third national lockdown. But the Health Secretary today said there were no plans for teachers to receive a Covid vaccination before going back to class. He told Sophy Ridge on Sunday: ""We've asked the expert group, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, what order we should vaccinate in, broadly in order to reduce the number of deaths as fast as possible. ""I think everybody can understand why we asked that as the question. ""They set out the priority groups one to nine, which includes those who are clinically most vulnerable and their carers, and includes the over-50s, going down the age range. ""They are currently considering, after that, what might be the best order in terms of clinical priority. ""There isn't strong evidence that teachers are more likely to catch Covid than any other group, but I'll leave it for the JCVI to set out what they think is the best order in which to do this that minimises the number of deaths."" But Mr Johnson's and Sir Keir's stance was backed by the Archbishop of Canterbury who said he was ""absolutely sure"" government was right to prioritise the reopening of schools. Justin Welby told Sky News: ""That is probably the most urgent thing, it's been the most urgent thing right the way through."" Boris Johnson is set to lay out his roadmap out of lockdown tomorrow night - understood to lay out a four-step plan. Under the plan, Brits are expected to be able to socialise outside with a friend or relative from another household, with current regulations limiting meet-ups to exercise only. This will be followed by an end to restrictions on close family interaction, meaning children will be able to hug their grandparents again. Sir Keir said he wanted the road map to be accompanied by published scientific evidence and an extended support package for businesses. ""We all want this to be the last lockdown so we've got to come out of it in a measured way, but make sure we are not back where we started in a number of weeks or months, so roll out slowly, carefully, follow the science,"" he said. Labour has called for business rate relief to go on for another six months and VAT cuts for hospitality to keep businesses viable. ""They've got this far; they need to survive beyond the next set of restrictions,"" he said. Sir Keir said it was ""probably inevitable"" that a vaccine passport would be needed for international travel but acknowledged there were no easy answers about whether there could be domestic requirements for people to demonstrate they had received a jab. ""Vaccine passports within the UK, I think, is something we need a national debate about, it is very difficult to see how it would work, but let's tread very, very carefully on this,"" he said."
361,361,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor","Boris Johnson urged to reshuffle Cabinet with Michael Gove, Matt Hancock and Gavin Williamson facing job changes","BORIS Johnson could reshuffle his Cabinet as soon as May, The Sun can reveal. The Prime Minister is being urged by allies to rejig his top team after the local elections. It would coincide with a major speech Mr Johnson has started to write to herald an ""era of recovery"" after the pandemic. One scenario discussed in No10 would see Matt Hancock move to Education and Michael Gove replace him at Health. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson could be on his way out, sources say. Allies also claim that Mr Johnson was ""furious"" with reports that he has lost faith in Minister for the Cabinet Office Mr Gove — and instead wants to see ""a reformer in his prime"" be handed a major new challenge. Insiders say the major efforts in extending the school year and pupil catch-up mean a ""new broom"" is needed after relations between Mr Williamson and the Education sector hit rock bottom. One Whitehall source said: ""Gavin has lost the teachers, the unions, the parents and frankly the trust of the PM to be able to fix this."" The insiders are split on whether his four-year Cabinet career would end, or whether he would be demoted to a more ""backroom"" role where he has previously thrived. Another scenario would see Mr Gove take over at the Home Office should Priti Patel have to fall on her sword over legal action around bullying claims. But Mr Johnson is said to be not keen on changing any of the Great Offices of State jobs. There is also mounting tension between his aides, with Brexit talks veteran Oliver Lewis quitting after just two weeks in charge of the SNP-fighting Union unit. Sources say he had threatened to walk multiple times since the departure of mentor Dominic Cummings. And some inside No10 are not impressed with Mr Cummings's replacement as head adviser. One said ex-Treasury official Dan Rosenfeld was ""obsessed with process and paperwork rather than politics and people"". A colleague claimed: ""It seems he wants to be the Chief of Stuff rather than the Chief of Staff."" Another compared Mr Rosenfeld's management style to David Brent from TV's The Office."
362,362,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha Clark,Two households will be able to meet up outside from Easter under Boris Johnson’s plan to end lockdown,"TWO households will be allowed to meet up outside by Easter under Boris Johnson's end-of-lockdown blueprint. The Prime Minister's five-month ""Roadmap to Recovery"" will allow outdoor mixing in parks and possibly gardens by Good Friday on April 2. His Covid operations war committee meets tomorrow to finalise the plan before it is put in front of his Cabinet to be signed off and then unveiled on Monday afternoon. A senior source said the decision to allow families to meet from Easter onwards came ""as a recognition of how tough these last few weeks and months have been"". There have also been discussions about reintroducing the Rule of Six to allow groups of half a dozen people from different households to meet from Easter too - however sources say this has not yet been confirmed. Decisions about the earliest possible dates for pubs and restaurants to open remain ""fluid"" — with Mr Johnson studying data this weekend. But it looks almost certain to be bad news for anyone desperately needing a haircut. Senior sources say the beauty industry still ""has some time to go"" before it can reopen. The close-contact issue means it may be late April before hairdressers can resume. Other treatments — such as waxing and pedicures ""where contact is inherent"" — could have to wait even longer. Nothing will happen before March 8 when the PM wants all children to return to schools in one go, across all age groups and areas. Yet those hopes were dashed last night as teaching unions threw yet another spanner in the works. Nine leftie education unions joined forces to slam what they called ""reckless"" plans for a blanket return in just over two weeks, insisting on a staggered system. They demanded only younger kids go back and older ones stay home longer or there will be a ""danger of causing another surge in the virus"". Both Scotland and Wales have announced a tiered approach, with kids starting back next week and a full return from March 15. But MPs last night told Mr Johnson to face down the union threats and get youngsters in classrooms as soon as possible. Tory MP Robert Halfon, chair of the education committee, said: ""We have to get all children learning again. ""The damage being done to mental health, education and life chances is something that's going to carry on every day they are not in school."" He called on the PM to create a coalition of parents, schools, staff and experts to support getting children back with teachers soonest. Alongside schools returning, people will be able to do more exercise outdoors from next month, with non-essential shops also likely to get the go-ahead later. In March, at the end of which the lockdown laws expire, stay-at-home messages are also expected to be lifted across UK and care home visits permitted again. But gyms and hospitality will likely have to wait to April. It could be May before pubs resume indoor service along with the Rule of Six — while the beauty industry and hairdressers, hopefully, will be open fully then. June should usher in indoor mixing between households and overnight stays may resume, with holidays in the UK back on. Those sectors facing delays in reopening look set for a Budget boost early in March. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is to extend the Universal Credit uplift for six more months and the furlough scheme until the crisis is over. The business rates relief is also to be extended. Hopes of a quicker easing of the rules were boosted by Professor Neil Ferguson, the leading architect of Britain's lockdown policy, insisting the numbers are ""looking promising"". The Imperial College London scientist added: ""The trade-off we have is between how quickly can we relax and how quickly we can immunise and protect the population."" But Mr Johnson is likely to come under increased pressure to speed up the plan after the Welsh government announced that hairdressers would open in mid-March. And in Wales from today, up to four people can exercise outside — up from the current limit of two. First Minister Mark Drakeford has said that next week he will look towards allowing weddings in small numbers — but Wales did go into lockdown two weeks before England."

364,364,The Sun,Jerome StarkeyHarry Cole,MI6 chief Richard Moore says sorry for ban on gay people serving as spies,"MI6 chief Richard Moore has apologised for a decades old ban on gay people serving in the intelligence services. The spy chief known as 'C' said the ban had blighted lives, shattered dreams and robbed the UK's secret agents of ""some of the best talent Britain could offer"". The ban was only lifted in 1991, long after homosexuality was decriminalised in England in 1967. Moore, 57, who joined MI6 in 1987, said the bar was put in place ""because of the misguided view that they would be more susceptible to blackmail than straight people"". ""Committed, talented, public-spirited people had their careers and lives blighted because it was argued that being LGBT+ was incompatible with being an intelligence professional,"" he said. ""Because of this policy, other loyal and patriotic people had their dreams of serving their country in MI6 shattered. ""This was wrong, unjust and discriminatory."" His comments are the first time MI6 has publicly apologised for the historic wrongs. It comes amid a campaign to recruit a wider range of spies including dual nationals and disabled people. Moore, who said he is married to ""an inspiring blind woman,"" has put diversity front and centre of his tenure at the helm of the Secret Intelligence Service, or SIS, as MI6 is also known. ""MI6 is open to people from all backgrounds, races, ages, sexualities, and all ways of thinking,"" Moore said in a video posted on Twitter. ""Diversity makes us more effective; inclusion makes us stronger."" Homosexuality was decriminalised in Scotland in 1980 and in Northern Ireland in 1981. Moore added: ""I apologise on behalf of MI6 for the way our LGBT+ colleagues and fellow citizens were treated and express my regret to those whose lives were affected."" At least two of the Cambridge Five spy ring, Guy Burgess and Anthony Blunt, were gay, while a third, Donald Maclean, is believed to have been bisexual. But Moore insisted that being LGBT+ did not make people a national security threat. ""Of course not,"" he said. ""But the ban did mean that we, in the intelligence and diplomatic services, deprived ourselves of some of the best talent Britain could offer."" Spooks have long acknowledged that gay people forced to lead secret lives often honed the perfect skills for being secret agents. Nonetheless, Moore admitted that prejudice lingered in MI6 stations long after the ban was lifted. ""Some staff who chose to come out were treated badly for not having previously disclosed their sexuality during their security vetting,"" Moore added. ""Others who joined in the period post-1991 were made to feel unwelcome. ""That treatment fuelled a reluctance to be their true selves in the workplace. This was also unacceptable."" It follows similar apologies from GCHQ, in 2016, and MI5 last year. Former head of GCHQ, Robert Hannigan, spoke about the ""horrifying"" treatment of his agency's most famous Bletchley Park codebreaker, Alan Turing, who was sentenced to 12 months of chemical castration after being convicted of gross indecency in 1952. Turing, who helped to crack the Enigma code that helped Britain win World War Two, took his own life with cyanide in 1954. Sir Andrew Parker, former head of MI5, said the ban on gay people in the Security Service was a source of ""regret and shame"". MI6 has not revealed how many staff were affected by the ban. But Moore, who ran secret agents in Afghanistan when the Taliban were in power, paid tribute to staff past and present, ""who slowly turned the tide by educating their workmates and fighting for change"". ""We still have more to do to become a fully inclusive employer, and my goal for MI6 is to make it a workplace where you can always bring your true self to work,"" he said. Nancy Kelley, head of the charity Stonewall said the apology was ""deeply moving"". ""'It's never easy to admit when you've done something wrong, let alone to do so publicly. ""Richard Moore's actions should be seen as a shining example to other leaders about what it means to right the wrongs of the past, and stand up for what you believe in. ""This discriminatory ban meant that countless LGBT+ people either lost the job they loved or lived in fear of being outed,"" she said. ""More than ever, we need more leaders from across society to step up, be courageous and support LGBT+ communities."""
365,365,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Boris Johnson to launch advertising blitz urging ‘one more heave’ of lockdown when he reveals roadmap,"BORIS Johnson's restrictions-lifting roadmap will be accompanied by an ad blitz urging ""one more heave"" of lockdown. The Government is currently spending millions on a Covid public awareness campaign designed to shock people into staying at home. But ahead of the first restrictions easing on March 8, a new softer message will be deployed as more freedoms are restored. A source said: ""As we wait for the vaccine rollout to reach everyone, it's essential that the rules are not ignored at the final stretch. ""The adverts will urge one more heave to get the country over the line."" Mr Johnson vowed to be driven by data not dates in his ""cautious and prudent"" lifting of Covid restrictions, starting on March 8 with reopening schools. He has repeatedly stressed that restrictions will be eased cautiously - and urged Brits to show patience in the months ahead. The PM insisted he doesn't want to have to go back into lockdown again, and he hopes this one would be the last. Schools are set to be the first things to reopen from March 8 onwards - pending any dramatic shift in infections or hospitalisations. However, it's not yet clear whether it will be all pupils or they will stagger them. Rules on meeting people outside are also likely to be relaxed in time for the Spring. Non essential-shops could are likely to open after schools and The Sun exclusively revealed how pubs and restaurants will be able to serve outdoors in April if coronavirus cases continue to fall. Staycations are likely to be allowed and Brits could take self-catered staycation breaks by Easter - if the reproductive rate of the virus stays low. There is no indication that social distancing will be scrapped in the coming months and it appears that lockdown will be lifted in stages. The PM was due to tell fellow world leaders today that we face the ""tantalising prospect of a return to normality"", but the mistakes of the Covid pandemic must never be allowed to happen again. He will use this year's presidency of the G7 — the annual gathering of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and US — to begin work on an international pandemic early warning system to stop any future virus from crippling the planet. At his first virtual meeting in charge, the PM will say: ""The development of viable coronavirus vaccines offers the tantalising prospect of a return to normality, but we must not rest on our laurels. ""As leaders of the G7 we must say today: never again."" He will urge the group to back an ambitious target of supporting the development of vaccines for emerging diseases in 100 days in future, a third of the time it took to successfully develop the Pfizer-BioNTech jab. And he wants funding to increase for Covax — the vaccine drive for poor countries. Last night, he pledged to donate ""the majority of surplus coronavirus vaccines"" to poorer nations. COVID cases are back down to where they were before the second wave of the pandemic and still falling. We are tantalisingly close to a return to normality, the Prime Minister will tell G7 colleagues today. For that, he will say, the world can thank scientists who have risen to the most extraordinary of challenges and performed brilliantly. Meanwhile, he will tell the rest of us enduring lockdown: ""Let's keep going."" That's all well and good but, as Boris plans his Roadmap to Recovery, he should be mindful not to waste the incredible opportunity the scientists have given us. That means aiming for the earliest possible exit from the freedom-denying, economy-crippling restrictions we are all suffering. We'll keep going Prime Minister, but you need to show us the finishing line."

The revamped 10 Downing Street briefing room is modelled on Washington's West Wing. It was due to host on-camera briefings from spinners and ministers. The PM had hoped his new press secretary Allegra Stratton would use it to field questions from the press pack three times a week. But the plan was iced as lockdown prevents journalists gathering. Downing Street declined to comment on the hefty bill last night. But sources blamed it on the listed status of Whitehall buildings — and their poor acoustics."
367,367,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Gordon Ramsay turns up the heat on Rishi Sunak to extend VAT cut and furlough for struggling hospitality sector,"SUPERSTAR chef Gordon Ramsay has heaped pressure on Rishi Sunak to extend the VAT holiday and furlough for struggling hospitality businesses at his Budget. The Hell's Kitchen star sat down with the Chancellor this week to warn the schemes have been a ""massive boost"" and ""pivotal"" to supporting restaurants, bars and pubs during the pandemic. Mr Sunak slashed VAT for the pub and restaurant trade to five per cent to help it survive the pandemic - but that measure is due to end on March 31. There are fears that he will not extend the measure as he attempts to fill the financial black-hole sparked by Covid. But The Sun is calling for VAT to be kept low in next month's Budget as it has been such a lifeline. The Michelin starred chef, who employs around 600 people in the UK and thousands more around the world, told Mr Sunak that his interventions has been ""instrumental in maintaining some positivity"" across the hammered sector. The top Tory has started a series of ""In Conversation"" meetings with industry leaders – to hear directly how he can help them fight the pandemic and put rocket boosters under Britain's recovery. At their virtual meeting Mr Ramsay said: ""I think as a government, we've been supported better than any other country I know. ""And secondly, you've been precise, what you've said you've stood by and delivered."" ""I think we've been given one of the most incredible support systems from the furlough scheme, which was instrumental in maintaining some positivity. I think you delivered beyond. ""But the downside for me is that we have lost some really good restaurants that were good, but sadly, there are going to be casualties."" Mr Sunak boosted hopes he will do more to save the trade, by telling Mr Ramsay: ""Economically it's incredibly important, but also it's that connection with people in their communities. ""It just gives joy to people's lives. It brings life to villages, towns across the country, and seeing that taken from us is incredibly sad and we have to recapture that again."" And offering advice on next month's Budget, Mr Ramsay warned cooking and cooking the books is the same: ""It's all in the prep right… The prep is 90 percent of the battle."" CHANCELLOR Rishi Sunak is a brave man to face a grilling from famously foul-mouthed superchef Gordon Ramsay. He will be relieved that the Hell's Kitchen star praised him for his furlough support for hospitality staff and his business rate holiday during the pandemic. But he should be in no doubt that the industry is in a perilous state. A key ingredient of his Budget should be an extension of the VAT holiday for struggling hospitality businesses, something The Sun has campaigned for. Ending it would be a recipe for disaster."
368,368,The Sun,Jonathan ReillyHarry Cole,Welsh Labour politician busted Zooming into meetings from her lover’s home in ENGLAND,"A  Welsh Labour rising star has been busted Zooming into meetings from her lover's home in ENGLAND. Rhianon Passmore, 48 took part in Welsh Parliament business from the £1m Swindon home of Nick Hartley, 54 nearly 100 miles away from her constituency of Newport, South Wales. It's understood Mr Hartley has shacked up with Ms Passmore and has been making regular lockdown visits from South Wales to Wiltshire. The cross-border jaunts come a day after Welsh Labour blasted Boris Johnson for visiting a mass vaccination site in the Principality, branding it ""unessential."" Welsh Health Minister Eluned Morgan hit out at the PM saying: ""We're not sure if in this case it was an essential visit, but he is the prime minister and has to make the judgement."" Ms Passmore, the Assembly Member for Islwyn, also posted and retweeted a series of ""stay at home"" messages online. But her own jaunts across the Severn were spotted when eagle eyed viewers of the Welsh Assembly realised that she was appearing at hearings from a new location - away from her terraces home in South Wales. She posed brazen clips last month from the garden room of the home in Hannington, Wilts. A source in the village said: ""She was broadcasting from the property and thought nobody would notice. ""Everyone has been doing their best to help keep the virus at bay and what she is doing is certainly not in the spirit of the lockdown. ""If you're going to tell everybody else what they've got to do you should at least uphold the spirit. ""And it's been quite a regular thing for some time. ""What makes me angry is that she's one of these are people who has been completely slating Boris and undermining what he's been trying to achieve."" Labour said that despite crossing the border Ms Passmore had not been breaking the rules as she was in a support bubble with Mr Hartley. But official Welsh guidance says they ""recommend that support bubbles are formed locally where possible."" It adds: ""In particular we ask that people think very carefully about possible alternatives before forming support bubbles which would require extensive travel or travel into areas outside Wales with very high incidence of coronavirus."" Last month Welsh Conservative leader Paul Davies quit after he had drinks with colleagues inside the Welsh Assembly. They denied breaking lockdown rules. When approached by The Sun yesterday Mr Hartley declined to comment. Last night Ms Passmore said: ""As a single parent household, I have formed a support bubble with my long-term partner. ""I do not believe I have acted outside of the guidance set out by the Welsh and UK Governments."""
369,369,The Sun,Joe DugganHarry Cole,"Hospitality bosses demand ALL pubs, restaurants and hotels are open from April as pressure piled on Boris Johnson","HOSPITALITY bosses have demanded all pubs, restaurants and hotels are reopened from April, piling pressure on Boris Johnson to ease restrictions quickly. Trade body UK Hospitality is urging an overhaul of the Covid tier system when lockdown is eased. In a document submitted to the PM, it called for all hospitality venues to have returned to normal by June, with Covid case rates continuing to tumble. It says the industry, which employed 3.2 million people before the pandemic, lost an eye-watering £72 billion in 2020, its worst year ever. It comes after industry leaders stormed out of a meeting with government ministers in a row over the PM's roadmap. Mr Johnson is set to reveal his full roadmap for lockdown easing on Monday - with restrictions set to be reviewed every few weeks. He has said he will be guided by ""data, not dates"" when announcing our route out of lockdown. The UK Hospitality document, seen by The Telegraph, says: 'The tier system that was in place as the country entered lockdown is unviable for the sector and must be reformed ahead of reopening."" Venues should be allowed to trade in all tiers except tier 4, the hospitality group said. Currently, hospitality venues must close in tier 3 areas, with only deliveries and takeaways allowed. Pubs and bars in tier 2 are also required to close unless they operate as restaurants and serve food as well as alcohol. The number of people employed in the pandemic-ravaged hospitality industry has slumped by more than a third to two million, UK Hospitality claimed. The Sun revealed last week that pubs and restaurants will be able to serve outdoors in April if Covid cases continue to fall. The reopening of hospitality is being fast-tracked in a major boost to the blighted sector — and thirsty Brits. Hospitality had been earmarked to reopen in May, with only takeaway pints allowed in April. But that has now been sped up in a major boost to the blighted sector. A wider reopening for limited indoor mixing in pubs and restaurants is still planned for May. But the ""rule of six"" limits and two-metre social distancing rules are likely to stay throughout summer Mr Johnson is facing growing pressure over when to restart the hospitality industry. Big pub chains — who have less to lose — are happy to wait a little longer until they can fully open. They fear that if they are allowed to open outdoors before fully reopening inside, their support from the Treasury could be cut off. Greg Mulholland, of the Campaign for Pubs, said: ""Outdoor-only opening is simply not profitable for thousands of pubs, indeed most pubs, and Government support must continue until pubs can open profitably, without rules and restrictions that make that impossible. ""What we now need is certainty over when pubs can reopen indoors with household mixing and no curfew or restriction on dining."" The Sun revealed tension boiled over earlier in the week when pub bosses stormed out of meetings with ministers when they were accused of leaking government roadmap plans. Another 12,057 infections were recorded today, down from 13,494 last Thursday, as cases continue to sink. Covid cases have dropped by two thirds since January, Britain's biggest virus infection survey found. The React study, by Imperial College London, carried out swab tests on 85,000 people across England between February 6 and 13, and found  the R rate is down to 0.7, even as low as 0.6 in London. Ministers have reportedly urged the PM to consider vaccine 'passports'  Covid to social venues reopened. A source told The Times: ""We're talking about industries that are dying here. ""In terms of getting live music, theatre and other parts of the entertainment industry back on their feet, it seems an obvious thing to do once the majority of people have been vaccinated."" But a government source told the paper a vaccine passport  system would be a ""bureaucratic nightmare ... like setting up the passport agency from scratch"". /c"
370,370,The Sun,Harry Cole,Rishi Sunak’s closest Treasury aides among most vocal critics of fuel duty hike,"HIKING fuel duty would be a hammer blow to ""not just motorists but their families"" a Treasury minister once declared. As Chancellor Rishi Sunak eyes the first rise in a decade of the hated levy at next month's Budget, The Sun can reveal his closest lieutenants used to be the most vocal critics of the tax. Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury Kemi Badenoch said in 2018 that ""continuing the freeze will help keep bills and the overall cost of living low."" While a backbencher, Ms Badenoch also signed a letter organised by Fair Fuel UK urging the Treasury not to unfreeze fuel duty as part of the Sun's Keep It Down campaign. It warned: ""Filling up at the pumps remains a critical factor that shapes consumer spending and business costs."" Meanwhile the now Financial Secretary to the Treasury Jesse Norman boasted of his campaigning work on keeping fuel duty frozen as a key reason for voters to re-elect him in 2015. He told his local paper it was one his most successful achievements as an MP. And in 2011 he told the Commons, fuel duty rises would have a ""direct impact on the well-being of my constituents."" Now the pair are serving in the Treasury that has hinted they could slap a further 5p of tax on the 58p levy in a bid to fill the Covid budget blackhole. Around 75,000 hard hit motorists who support Fair Fuel UK are expected to contact the Chancellor this week to urge him not to hike fuel duty, and Mr Sunak faces a grim warning from his own MPs that they will fight his Budget if he does try to hike the tax. Tory MPs are organising a letter urging the Chancellor to think again. Meanwhile hauliers are demanding and exemption from any future rise after they helped keep the nation going through lockdown. Sir Mike Penning MP, Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Road Freight and Logistics said: ""It will be impossible for our economy to recover without a road freight and logistics sector that is fighting fit. ""The Chancellor must ensure that the Budget supports and protects this vital industry which has been so badly hit by the impacts of the pandemic. ""For far too long our hauliers have been hit with the highest rate of fuel duty in Europe. ""The Chancellor can send a powerful statement about the value of the industry by ending this fuel duty penalty through the introduction of an essential user rebate bringing us in line with our European neighbours."" The Treasury declined to comment on Budget ""speculation."""
371,371,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Fury as Facebook tries to censor online appreciation of local dish faggots and peas,"WOKE wars have broken out in the Black Country after Facebook tried to censor online appreciation of traditional local dish faggots and peas. The Californian tech giants issued a grovelling apology after trying to ban a West Midlands local history group for discussing their love of the ancient meatball treat - sparking fury from locals and MPs. Members of a popular community group were left in disbelief after users were warned about posting ""offensive"" and ""homophobic"" content. But last night Facebook said sorry over the row, blaming faulty tech for tech for the blunder. A spokesperson said: ""Our systems clearly made a mistake here and we apologise to users whose posts about this local delicacy were affected. We're looking into what happened and are taking steps to rectify the error."" Faggots and peas is a traditional dish in the Black Country - but residents were told they were breaching community standards by discussing the local delicacy. Admin Linda Beech has now had to warn users of to stop using the the word 'faggot', which is sometimes used as a derogatory term for a gay person in the USA. In Britain, faggots are meatballs traditionally hand-made with offal by butchers and served with mashed potatoes and peas. Local MP Mike Wood has slammed the censorship, branding it ""ludicrous"". And the Dudley South Tory even invited Facebook's billionaire boss Mark Zuckerberg to come and sample the local delicacy ""next time you are in Brierley Hill"". In a letter to the tech guru, Mr Wood wrote: ""Online services like Facebook have an important – and challenging – role to play in combating abuse and extremism on their platforms, and I know the hurt that inappropriate language can cause. ""I don't pretend that there are any easy solutions that will keep everybody happy. ""However, perhaps I could suggest as a rough rule of thumb that hate speech rarely involves recipes for offal meatballs and peas."" He added: ""The supposed violations appear to relate to a number of posts relating to the traditional Black Country delicacy of faggots and peas (or ""faggits and paes"" as they are sometimes known in these parts), large pork meatballs that have been eaten locally since at least the middle of the nineteenth century. ""One of the group's admins has already been thrown out, and the group has been told that more admin violations may result in the group being disabled. ""It's ludicrous that you're banning a group celebrating a local recipe. What next? Censorship of spotted dick and a lifetime ban for Bake Off? And he insisted: ""There is nothing homophobic, discriminatory or hateful about faggots and peas."" Dudley North MP, Marco Longhi added ""this woke agenda has gone too far. First it was historic statues and now it's our food. What will they target next?"" The fellow Tory went on: ""I'm very tempted to send Mr Zuckerberg some lovely homemade faggots and peas!"" And web users have blasted the social media giant for ""political correctness gone mad"" after they were threatened with a permanent ban for talking about their famous dish. Linda, who runs Pensnett, Brierley Hill and Blackcountry Now and Then page, which has nearly 14,000 members, told followers: ""We are in danger of losing the group."" She wrote: ""Please be careful and think before you comment on the subject, as a few of you are still putting us at risk."" She also revealed how one admin member had already been kicked off the website after Facebook trawled through posts dating back to May last year. She said: ""Facebook searched back to May last year and showed me the content, of which was perfectly acceptable to us Blackcountry Folks. ""One more strike and the group would have been evaporated. ""I know he is very upset and wounded with me, but I had no power of my own to prevent this happening to him. ""I feel as though I have lost my right arm, I cannot thank my other Admins enough for their total loyalty to the group."" Linda has built the group up over five years and it has become a space to share old photographs and to reminisce about Black Country's heritage. Community campaigner Adam Davies says he has written to Facebook to call for intervention to help save the group. He said: ""I have written a fairly lengthy report to Facebook as well as an email to their press team outlining the full context of the issue which their system is incorrectly flagging up. ""Obviously I won't post the text of my email here because it contains the word which is in question, but it simply can't be right that the existence of this brilliant group and the heritage of our area should be under threat because a Facebook algorithm/system doesn't understand the name of a food dish which has long been associated with our area. ""I have a few thoughts about who else we can contact to make sure this reaches whoever it needs to. ""Please let me know if a real human from Facebook contacts you as I've asked them to in my email and report. ""We can't let this brilliant group and our area's proud heritage be lost because of this ridiculous situation!"" Garry Sawers, known as Black Country Gaz, said he has posted a song about 'faggots an paeys' on his page in protest. He added: ""It makes my blood boil cos it could be Black Country next."" One local resident added: ""This is political correctness gone made, the usual bunch of woke nonsense we have come to expect these days."" Another poster said: ""I'm a Londoner born and bred and even I know what they [faggots] are. I love the Brains ones. The word also means a type of fuel for the fire."" Another horrified faggots and peas fan said: ""Facebook has obviously decided it means something other than a rather tasty meat based product that's synonymous with the Black Country."" Faggots are made of meat off-cuts and offal such as pig hearts and originated in the Midlands and Wales, becoming popular during WW2 due to rationing."
372,372,The Sun,Harry ColeJonathan ReillyNick Gutteridge,Boris to decide ‘roadmap to recovery’ after lockdown based on dossier of evidence handed to him tonight,"BORIS Johnson will be handed a dossier of data as early as tonight to help him decide the speed of his ""Roadmap to Recovery"" blueprint. The PM will use the numbers to shape his official plan to ease lockdown, to be published on Monday. Mr Johnson yesterday vowed to be driven by data not dates in his ""cautious and prudent"" lifting of Covid restrictions, starting on March 8 with reopening schools. But The Sun understands the document will also mention other specific dates as the earliest possible opportunity for shops and pubs to reopen if cases continue to fall and vaccinations lead to a decline in deaths. The PM is due to receive the up-to-date analysis by tomorrow morning at the latest. It will show for the first time how effective the Oxford jab has been. He will then crunch those numbers to finalise the roadmap with a core team of Cabinet ministers and aides over the weekend. It is expected that the document will be put before the full Cabinet on Monday morning to rubber stamp and then be presented to MPs at lunchtime. Mr Johnson will address the nation later at a Monday evening press conference. Last week's data showed just one dose of the Pfizer vaccine provided two-thirds protection against the virus, boosting hopes of a swift return to normality. And Government scientists at Public Health England hope the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab will have similarly positive results to present ahead of the weekend. Ministers are also delighted at data from Israel showing a direct link between vaccines and plummeting hospital and death rates. During a visit to South Wales yesterday, the PM warned he was going to take things slowly because he did not want another lockdown. He told reporters: ""We'll be setting out what we can on Monday about the way ahead, and it'll be based firmly on a cautious and prudent approach to coming out of lockdown in such a way as to be irreversible."" Mr Johnson is facing growing pressure over when to restart the hospitality industry. Big pub chains — who have less to lose — are happy to wait a little longer until they can fully open. They fear that if they are allowed to open outdoors before fully reopening inside, their support from the Treasury could be cut off. The Sun can reveal tension boiled over earlier in the week when pub bosses stormed out of meetings with ministers when they were accused of leaking government roadmap plans. Landlords have stopped engaging with officials and ministers at the Business Department after tensions over reopening the hospitality industry ramped up. Some pub bosses are urging ministers to rethink opening outdoor areas in April — as many would be unable to turn a profit if they lost government support. They want boozers to open at the same time as non-essential shops. Greg Mulholland, of the Campaign for Pubs, said: ""Outdoor-only opening is simply not profitable for thousands of pubs, indeed most pubs, and Government support must continue until pubs can open profitably, without rules and restrictions that make that impossible. ""What we now need is certainty over when pubs can reopen indoors with household mixing and no curfew or restriction on dining."" British Beer & Pub Association boss Emma McClarkin, said 29,000 boozers would stay shut if service was allowed only outdoors. What we now need is certainty over when pubs can reopen indoors. She added: ""Even if some pubs did try and open outdoors only in April, all it would take is some heavy rain and they would find it has all been for nothing."" Richard Bailey, chairman of the Thwaites pub group accused the PM of betrayal, saying: ""Once again the pubs of this nation will be made a scapegoat in the reopening plan."" It comes as 40 MPs warn the PM and Chancellor Rishi Sunak that British nightlife faces extinction without a plan and more support. Labour's Jeff Smith, who chairs a cross party group of MPs on the night-time economy, said it could lead to town and city centres resembling ghost towns. Boris Johnson joked that he felt like OJ Simpson as he struggled to pull on a pair of gloves. The PM was referring to OJ's murder trial when the US star had difficulty putting on gloves thought to have been used in the killings. Mr Johnson made the quip on a visit to a vaccination centre in Cwmbran, Torfaen."
373,373,The Sun,Harry ColeKate Ferguson,World Cup legend Sir Geoff Hurst urges Brits to get Covid vaccine for their country,"WORLD Cup winner Sir Geoff Hurst last night urged Brits to get vaccinated for their country — as the Covid R rate dropped to its lowest since last summer. His patriotic appeal came as it emerged pubs and restaurants may open outdoors in April, earlier than planned, if transmission levels keep falling. And there was more good news, with the UK expecting to smash its target of offering a jab to all 15 million of the most vulnerable Brits before Monday. Sports fans could also be sent Covid tests along with their tickets so they can watch major events including the Euros and Wimbledon again this summer. Last night sports stars and ministers urged over-70s to get vaccinated before GPs move to the next age groups. Sir Geoff, 79 - who scored a hat-trick in the 1966 World Cup Final — told Brits: ""This is a global pandemic. For goodness sake, just get it done. It's in your interest, as well as that of your family, friends, workmates and your country."" Cricket commentator David ""Bumble"" Lloyd, 73, added: ""Don't hesitate, just do it. Every single jab makes us all safer. Bumble says, 'Get on with the jab'."" Boris Johnson and nearly 30 of his ministers will today visit vaccination centres across the country in a final push for the over-70s. Scientists said yesterday the official R rate is between 0.7 and 0.9 — the first time since last July that it has been below 1 nationwide. Separate data found London's could be as low as 0.44. Around 35 per cent of people living there have already had Covid, according to University of Cambridge research. If cases continue to fall at the current rate, The Sun can reveal that pubs and restaurants will be reopened for outdoor table service in April. Hospitality had been earmarked to reopen in May, with only takeaway pints allowed in April. But that has now been sped up in a major boost to the blighted sector. A government source said: ""If hospital numbers and cases continue to fall at the current rate we will hopefully be sipping pints in the spring sunshine sooner rather than later."" A wider reopening for limited indoor mixing in pubs and restaurants is still planned for May. However, it is likely the ""rule of six"" limits and two-metre distancing will stay all summer as a compromise for the early reopening. Meanwhile, Britain is on course to hit its first big target of vaccinating 15 million Brits by today — two days early. The PM last night hailed the efforts of the army of volunteers and medics vaccinating the nation. In a video from No10, he said: ""They are really going gangbusters — shooting the lights out."" The PM unveils his plan out of lockdown on February 22, and is expected to deliver on his pledge to reopen schools on March 8. A minister told The Sun the numbers are ""looking good"" and a path back to freedom can be plotted. They pointed out that all strains of the virus are far less likely to spread outside. The minister added: ""It is all going well. The rates are coming down, the numbers are looking good. We are on course for the roadmap. ""Outdoor ventilation is key. There are new mutations of the virus, but nothing changes how it spreads."" But they warned other sectors will only gradually be reopened to avoid another Covid wave. They said: ""Things won't reopen as quickly as some may want. ""We will be cautious, opening one thing to see how it goes before moving to the next."" Reopening sporting events to fans this summer may also be aided by issuing Covid tests with their tickets, it was reported last night. Spectators may have to prove they are negative to be allowed in to events including Wimbledon and football matches in the Euros. A government source said it was ""very early days"" and urged everyone to wait for the roadmap. Tory MPs yesterday urged the PM to seize on the success of the vaccine rollout to swiftly free businesses from lockdown. Prof Neil Ferguson — a government adviser and chief architect of lockdown — also said he is hopeful this will be ""the final one"". He told politics website Politico: ""Certainly by May, we hopefully will be in a place much more like we were back last October. In something akin to Tier 2. And maybe, if there are areas with very low incidence by that time, we'd move to Tier 1-type measures."" Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said: ""The vaccination programme is going so well that in a matter of weeks we will have protected most of those who would die from this virus. ""The Government must now look at how it can unlock the country and economy."" The Covid R rate is the number of people an infected person will pass it on to. The level has fallen from last week's 0.7 to 1. UK Covid deaths also dropped by a quarter in a week. There were 758 more recorded yesterday — down from the 1,014 a week before. Cases are also plummeting, with 15,144 recorded yesterday - a 20 per cent drop from the 19,114 infections last week. It brought the number of positive cases to 4,013,799, while the fatality total now stands at 116,287."

Meanwhile, Britain is on course to hit its first big target of vaccinating 15 million Brits by today — two days early. The PM last night hailed the efforts of the army of volunteers and medics vaccinating the nation. We will hopefully be sipping pints in the spring sunshine sooner rather than later. In a video from No10, he said: ""They are really going gangbusters — shooting the lights out."" The PM unveils his plan out of lockdown on February 22, and is expected to deliver on his pledge to reopen schools on March 8. A minister told The Sun the numbers are ""looking good"" and a path back to freedom can be plotted. They pointed out that all strains of the virus are far less likely to spread outside. The minister added: ""It is all going well. The rates are coming down, the numbers are looking good. We are on course for the roadmap. ""Outdoor ventilation is key. There are new mutations of the virus, but nothing changes how it spreads."" But they warned other sectors will only gradually be reopened to avoid another Covid wave. They said: ""Things won't reopen as quickly as some may want. ""We will be cautious, opening one thing to see how it goes before moving to the next."" Reopening sporting events to fans this summer may also be aided by issuing Covid tests with their tickets, it was reported last night. Spectators may have to prove they are negative to be allowed in to events including Wimbledon and football matches in the Euros. A government source said it was ""very early days"" and urged everyone to wait for the roadmap. Tory MPs yesterday urged the PM to seize on the success of the vaccine rollout to swiftly free businesses from lockdown. Prof Neil Ferguson — a government adviser and chief architect of lockdown — also said he is hopeful this will be ""the final one"". He told politics website Politico: ""Certainly by May, we hopefully will be in a place much more like we were back last October. ""In something akin to Tier 2. And maybe, if there are areas with very low incidence by that time, we'd move to Tier 1-type measures."" Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said: ""The vaccination programme is going so well that in a matter of weeks we will have protected most of those who would die from this virus. ""The Government must now look at how it can unlock the country and economy."" The Covid R rate is the number of people an infected person will pass it on to. The level has fallen from last week's 0.7 to 1. UK Covid deaths also dropped by a quarter in a week. There were 758 more recorded yesterday — down from the 1,014 a week before. Cases are also plummeting, with 15,144 recorded yesterday - a 20 per cent drop from the 19,114 infections last week. It brought the number of positive cases to 4,013,799, while the fatality total now stands at 116,287."
375,375,The Sun,Harry Cole,"Fuel duty rise in next month’s Budget will be a blow to the North, Chancellor Rishi Sunak warned","A BUDGET rise in fuel duty would be a hammer blow to the North, Rishi Sunak has been warned. Drivers outside the South East spend a third more of their incomes on fuel, campaigners say. And if the Chancellor raises the hated 57.95p a litre tax on fuel, it will hit new Tory voters in the former Red Wall areas the hardest, their data shows. Campaigning Tory MP Robert Halfon said: ""Coronavirus has hurt the low-paid and increased the cost of living. ""A fuel duty increase would be a hammer blow to workers and our public services."" Analysis by CEBR for FairFuelUK reveals motorists in London and the Home Counties spend between 2.2 per cent and 3.5 per cent of their household income filling up. But that figure is 4.5 per cent in the North East — and even more in Wales and Northern Ireland. WE'RE mobilising supporters to email their MPs and the Treasury to end the idea of raising fuel duty. There is only so much motorists can take. With diesel and petrol vehicles to be axed in just nine years, keeping fuel duty frozen is the least they can do. Better still, cut it and watch UK plc and government approval flourish. A decade ago, The Sun launched the Keep It Down fuel duty campaign. George Osborne, as Chancellor, was so rattled he cut a penny off the tax and it has been frozen ever since. So we are restarting our crusade again — with the support of FairFuelUK."

More than 13.5million Brits — one in five — have been vaccinated against the virus. Britain is on course to hit its hugely ambitious target of offering the jab to 15 million vulnerable people by mid-February. Nearly 450,000 were jabbed yesterday as it emerged deaths have dropped by a quarter in a week and cases by 34 per cent. The PM has vowed to share his plan for leaving lockdown on February 22. Last night Rob Halfon, Tory chairman of the Education Select Committee, said: ""We need to make sure March 8 is signed in blood, not just a line in the sand."" And the Covid Recovery Group of 70 Tory backbenchers warned they would not tolerate any more delay. The group's boss Mark Harper said: ""It's crucial we don't backslide on this, not least because the Government has said it wants to give schools two weeks' notice before they open. ""And, as the PM said, it is the 'settled will' of most MPs that pupils should be back in school on March 8."" Tory MP Peter Bone said: ""With so many people vaccinated, it would be absurd to continue with the lockdown. We need to get our children back to school."" Some 13.5 million Brits have now been vaccinated against Covid and the nation is on course to hit its mighty target of offering 15 million jabs to vulnerable people by mid-February. Some 450,000 were vaccinated yesterday. Mr Johnson scrambled to calm jitters after two Sage scientists broke cover to issue gloomy warnings against lifting the lockdown. Sir Jeremy Farrar said Covid infections must be cut from the current 750,000 to just 9,000 ""before we can think about lifting restrictions"". While Prof John Edmunds said opening schools could push the vital R rate above 1, and that some restrictions will be needed until Christmas. Downing Street sources hit back insisting the PM is still 100 per cent committed to the March 8 target. A Whitehall insider told The Sun: ""Nothing in the PM's goal has changed. We will be studying the data next week and fingers crossed it will allow us to proceed as the PM has set out."" Furious Tory MPs slammed the scientists for trying to ""move the goalposts"". Former minister Steve Baker accused boffins of depressing Brits. He said: ""I fear senior scientists are failing to recognise their power to spread despair and despondency."" A further 678 UK Covid deaths were reported yesterday, taking the total to 115,529. But figures show that, compared with last week, deaths are down by a quarter and cases by 34 per cent."
377,377,The Sun,Harry Cole,"Amazon and Facebook must give back with revenues tax after pandemic boom, Chancellor urges","TECH giants that have boomed in the pandemic must now give back with a tax on their revenues. That is the message Rishi Sunak will deliver to fellow finance chiefs as Britain starts its presidency of the G7. The Chancellor will meet counterparts from the world's powerhouses this afternoon — and the ""Amazon and Facebook Tax"" will be top of his agenda. Britain will host the annual gathering of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the United States. The world leaders will meet in Cornwall in June — but the finance ministers are the first to get together via Zoom. Mr Sunak has tried to tax tech firms two per cent of their UK revenues. But the global firms use sophisticated structures, moving money and assets around as well as basing themselves offshore so it is hard to establish true revenues. Mr Sunak wants to use this year to set up a global effort to target these profits, coordinated by the G7 group. Global attempts to clamp down on US tech giants faltered after fierce resistance from Donald Trump when he was president. But Mr Sunak's allies say there is growing hope of ""more scope"" with the new Joe Biden administration in the White House. A Treasury source said: ""The post-pandemic world is going to look different and it's right that we work together to find a global agreement on how profits are taxed for online companies to level up the playing field."""
378,378,The Sun,Kate FergusonHarry Cole,Boris Johnson vows schools WILL return from March 8 despite Sage scientists warning move will push R rate above 1,"BORIS Johnson has told ministers there will be no backsliding his goal of getting kids back to class from March 8 - despite a mutiny by Sage scientists. The PM scrambled to calm jitters after two top boffins broke cover to issue gloomy warnings about the perils of easing lockdown. Sir Jeremy Farrar said Covid infections must be cut from the current 750,000 to just 9,000 ""before we can think about lifting restrictions"". While Prof John Edmunds said opening schools could push the R rate above 1, and some restrictions will be needed until Christmas. Both sit on the committee of scientists that advise the PM on Covid, but broke cover on the same day. Boris has vowed to publish his roadmap out of lockdown on February 22, and has promised to reopen schools from March 8 if possible. Downing Street sources hit back at the Sage advisers - insisting the PM is still 100% committed to the March 8 target. A Whitehall insider told The Sun: ""Nothing in the PM's goal has changed. We will be studying the data next week and fingers crossed it will allow us to proceed as the PM has set out."" Furious Tory MPs slammed the scientists for trying to ""move the goalposts"" and urged the PM to stick to his guns on unlocking Britain. Speaking tonight, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said he hoped the vaccination programme would allow schools to reopen from March 8. He said: ""Part of the reason that we took a difficult position to close schools was because of the household interaction that would take place, because families mix when they are picking up the children or dropping the children off at school. ""We want to be really careful to make sure that we do it and do it in a sustainable way."" Boris is under massive pressure to start unlocking Britain as the vaccination programme is going so well. Nearly 13.5 million Brits have had the jab - a fifth of the entire adult population. But despite the stonking rollout, Sage scientists have been touring TV and radio studios urging the PM to keep the lockdown going longer. Sir Jeremy said: ""It is not sensible to set a date when restrictions will be lifted. ""Those restrictions can and they will be lifted, but only when the data allows that to be true. ""Setting a date now, arbitrarily, for some (time) in March or April, frankly doesn't make any sense."" He said infection rates should plummet before No10 even thinks about easing restrictions. He told the BBC: ""Transmission is still incredibly high in the UK. If transmission were still at this level and we were not in lockdown, we would be going into lockdown. ""There are 750,000 people today in the UK infected, there's still huge pressure on the NHS and on critical care in this country. ""We've made enormous progress – the UK deserves great credit for the science behind the vaccines and the rollout, (with) 30 million people now vaccinated in this country. ""But the transmission rate is incredibly high still and we've got to get it lower, we've got to get it – in my view – into the single thousands before we can possibly think of lifting restrictions."" His fiery intervention came just hours after Prof. Edmunds warned the country will not get back to normality until Christmas. He said:  ""If we opened up schools I think that the reproduction number would get close to 1, and possibly exceed one. ""If we opened them up completely – if we opened secondary schools and primary schools both at the same time – I suspect we'd be lucky to keep the reproduction number below 1. ""I think we have to do everything very gradually and see how it goes."" Even when lockdown is eased, the rule of six will need to be in force until Christmas, he warned. He told ITV's Peston Show: ""We are going to have to be under some restrictions for some time."" He said all Brits will need both their jabs before restrictions can be torn up totally. And the PM's official spokesman fuelled fears the reopening of schools could be delayed. He said the roadmap out of lockdown will only be published ""the week of February 22"", but that schools will need to be given two weeks notice to reopen. This means they could reopen later if the roadmap gets delayed until later in the week. But a group of 70 mutinous Conservative backbenchers warned they will not tolerate any more delay. Former minister Steve Baker, deputy chairman of The Covid Recovery Group of lockdown-sceptic Tories, said the scientists are depressing locked-down Brits. He fumed: ""Having a full public debate is essential at this time but I fear senior scientists are failing to recognise their power to spread despair and despondency. ""Some seem to be floating untested hypotheses in the media.  Doing so is not science. It is the death of science. ""Perhaps worse, it brings scientists squarely into the political domain, something we would, I am sure, all like to avoid. ""I look forward to the Prime Minister's 22 February roadmap out of restrictions so that we can all reclaim our lives once and for all."" The group's boss, Tory MP Mark Harper, warned: ""The Prime Minister, vaccines minister and Health Secretary have all confirmed that the plan for lifting restrictions would come on February 22. ""It's crucial we don't backslide on this, not least because the Government has said it wants to give schools 2 weeks notice before they open, and - as the PM said - it is the 'settled will' of most MPs that pupils should be back in school on 8th March."""
379,379,The Sun,Harry ColeNick Gutteridge,Matt Hancock says parents CAN take kids to the park after fury over warning playgrounds are ‘for people without gardens’,"MATT Hancock today insisted it's ""perfectly reasonable"" for parents to take their kids to the park after a Government warning playgrounds are 'mainly for people without gardens' sparked a backlash. The Health Secretary said people are encouraged to take exercise with family members, but shouldn't mix outside with other households. His remarks come after he was recently criticised for taking his own son out to play rugby in a north London park. He told Sky News: ""The rules are really clear. Exercise outdoors with members of your own family or one other person one to one, that's OK. ""Of course going to the park with your kids to play rugby is not only allowed, but perfectly reasonable and totally fine."" A row erupted after two young boys were told to go home by police while playing in the snow in their local playground in central London. Brothers Bo and Wren Greany, aged six and eight, are said to have been told by an officer they should be playing at home in their own garden. Under Covid lockdown rules playgrounds have remained open but Brits are told they ""must not socialise with other people while there"". Dad Tim Greany told the BBC: ""We were really made to feel that we were doing something wrong by being there. ""It felt especially important during this lockdown for my children to be able to get outside and have a run around, let off steam and play freely. ""It feels like a grey area in the rules that needs to be made clear - especially to police but also so parents know what is allowed."" When questioned about the situation, a Cabinet Office spokesman said: ""Playgrounds are primarily for use by children who do not have access to private outdoor space, and while parents, guardians or carers are allowed to take children to a playground for exercise, they must not socialise with other people while there."" But Tory MP Steve Baker branded the warning an ""expression of state power beyond the limits of the law that ""would be comical if it were not for real."" He added: ""As the government succeeds in vaccinating the vulnerable, incidents like this only underscore the need to reclaim our lives once and for all."" The warning had come after parents groups complained that the rules around playgrounds were confusing. The Playing Out campaign is urging the Government to ""include play as essential exercise"" - one of the limited reasons people are allowed to leave the house under current legislation. They said: ""Children playing outside doesn't get recognised as being exercise because it doesn't look like exercise in the way adults do it, like going for a run. ""It would give parents reassurance that it's a legitimate reason to be outside with their children if it were included in the guidelines. ""There is a lack of clarity, and the people that suffer in the end are the children who are not able to exercise."""
380,380,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Boris Johnson aware ‘for more than a year’ Harry Dunn fugitive Anne Sacoolas was US spy – but did not tell teen’s family,"BORIS Johnson and his top ministers were aware ""more than a year ago"" that the American woman charged over the death of Harry Dunn was a spy, senior sources have told The Sun. A US court heard last week that fugitive mother-of-three Anne Sacoolas worked in intelligence, but Downing Street have repeatedly insisted Washington only told them she was a diplomat's wife. But The Sun has learnt the UK Government had established Sacoolas's espionage background in the weeks after she fled Britain following her fatal crash with the teenage biker in August 2019. Yet they did not tell Harry's family, despite them asking Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab directly if she was a spy. The Prime Minister has never spoken to Harry's grieving parents, even after repeated requests for a meeting or a call. Sacoolas fled the UK in mid-September 2019 claiming diplomatic immunity, with her lawyer finally admitting last week she was ""employed by an intelligence agency in the US"" at the time which was ""especially a factor"" in her departure. Although Dominic Raab insists he was not aware of the case until after Sacoolas was back in the US, this newspaper has established security officials, diplomats and ministers did learn of her spy past in the autumn of 2019. And multiple sources have told The Sun the PM was personally made aware of the situation. No10 have declined to say whether Mr Johnson thinks the United States ""misled"" Britain about Sacoolas's intelligence career - in what would be a major blow to the Special Relationship But the slain teen's parents have vowed to get to the truth. Last night the family said the case was getting ""murkier and murkier"" as they once again urged the PM and Mr Raab to ""come clean"" on exactly what they knew and when. Family spokesman Radd Seiger told The Sun: ""Harry's parents have only ever wanted the truth and justice for their son. ""To learn, after all this time, that the PM was aware of Mrs Sacoolas' status shortly after the crash and yet did not ensure that the parents were told, is deeply hurtful."" He added: ""We met with Dominic Raab on 18 December 2019 and 28 January 2020 and several times since and he did not tell us the truth despite us asking the direct question as to whether she was a spy when Harry died. ""We need to know who knew what and when, and why we were not told."" Asked about the case this week, the PM's press secretary Allegra Stratton said: ""I am afraid I can't comment in total detail on that but our position on that has been quite consistent... we couldn't have lawfully prevented her from leaving the UK."" ""But the Americans refusal to extradite [Sacoolas] is a denial of justice and that is something that the Foreign Secretary has raised with his opposite number in America."" Asked why the PM has not met Harry's family, she replied: ""I think the family has had considerable engagement with our politicians and I think that it's proper for the people who are familiar with details of the case to deal with the family."" Ms Stratton added: ""The Prime Minister understands the gravity of how they feel and can only sympathise with the distress of his death in the first place and then how it's how it has been drawn out in the months and years since."""

The Sun has learnt ministers are to back calls to make an ""intent to share intimate images"" an offence in new abuse legislation. Campaign group Refuge have been pushing for the law change and won the backing of the Oscar-winning actress. Last week Colman recorded a video message to the Home Secretary urging her to back the clampdown. She said: ""Right now, women in this country are being abused by partners threatening to share explicit images of them. ""Please change the law. Make threatening to share explicit imagery illegal, now. And protect women from the naked threat."" The campaigners found one in 14 adults in England and Wales have experienced threats to share intimate images or videos – equivalent to 4.4 million. Threats to share intimate images are most prevalent amongst young people with one in seven young women experiencing the sick menace. The Government's Domestic Abuse Bill is currently in the House of Lords but due back before MPs in the coming weeks. Ex-Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan has put forward an amendment to the bill, calling it a ""landmark opportunity for change"". She added: ""If the amendment is agreed millions of women will be protected."" A government source told The Sun that the Home Office and Ministry of Justice ""do not disagree with the objectives of the amendment and will work with its sponsors to find a solution."" Lisa King of Refuge said: ""In a show of amazing commitment many peers stood in the House of Lords at midnight on Monday and called for this vital change to be made to the Bill. ""The time for change is now – women's lives and well-being depend on it.""

382,382,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha ClarkNick McDermott,Matt Hancock says Britain is ‘turning a corner’ in battle against coronavirus,"BRITAIN is ""turning a corner in the battle against coronavirus"", Matt Hancock declared last night. And the incredible team effort, which has already seen 12.3 million people in the UK vaccinated, could not be better illustrated than in the work of footballer Olivia Smart. The Leeds United defender, 26, swapped her boots and shinpads for scrubs and a facemask yesterday as she became the first nurse to give out the vaccine at the club's Elland Road ground. Health Secretary Mr Hancock had confirmed that the target of vaccinating the country's most vulnerable by Valentine's Day this Sunday was within grasp as he revealed 91 per cent of over-80s have had their first dose. Some 95 per cent of those aged 75 to 80 have also been jabbed, along with 75 per cent of those in the 70 to 74 bracket. Despite the snow slowing jab rates on Sunday, NHS boss Dr Nikki Kanani said 1,500 vaccination sites ""from mosques to museums, from gurdwaras to sports grounds, from cathedrals to community centres"" had battled on. And in a further boost to Britain's virus-fighting armoury, 4.5million tests are now being conducted every week — 97 per cent of which are turned around in under 24 hours. Mr Hancock told the Downing Street press conference: ""Take-up of the vaccine has been significantly better than we had hoped."" But in a dramatic switch in policy, he said anyone over 70 who has yet to receive their first dose is now being encouraged to self-refer. All adults in the top four eligibility groups will be able to make an appointment online or via their GP. It includes frontline care workers, vulnerable Brits asked to shield, and those aged 70 and above. Until now, they were strictly asked to wait to receive a call or letter from the NHS. But health bosses now want them to come forward in a final push to vaccinate all those at the highest risk by the start of next week. Dr Kanani, medical director for primary care at NHS England and a practising GP, said: ""If you are aged 70 and over, and have not yet received your vaccine, please make an appointment as soon as you can. ""The vaccine is safe, simple, and will offer you and those around you crucial protection against the virus."" Officials said all bookings will be cross-referenced to stop ineligible Brits from jumping the queue. And Mr Hancock said: ""We are on track to meet our goal of offering everyone in the top four priority groups a jab. ""We have said, 'Please wait until the NHS contacts you'. But I now urge everyone aged 70 and over who hasn't had a vaccination to contact the NHS. ""And if you have grandparents, relatives and friends over 70, encourage them to book an appointment as soon as possible."" The shift came as Boris Johnson and medics led a concerted charge to soothe fears that the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab is not as effective as hoped against the South African strain of Covid. The PM said the jab was ""no doubt the way out"" of the pandemic — despite concerns over the weekend. Visiting the SureScreen Diagnostics testing site in Derby, he insisted it was a ""massive benefit to our country and the population"" and still worked to stop serious disease and death. Mr Johnson added: ""We also think, in particular in the case of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, that there's good evidence that it is stopping transmission as well, I think, 67 per cent reduction in transmission."" He was speaking yesterday after a worrying study of 2,000 patients appeared to show that the Oxford vaccine was not able to stop mild to moderate illness of the variant, leading to South Africa to pause its rollout until more research is done. But, crucially, none of the people involved in the research were hospitalised or died — and some trial participants showed only mild or moderate Covid symptoms. While the PM did not rule out that the South African variant could lead to a delay in easing restrictions if it reduces the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine's effect on transmission, medics played down its threat. Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer, said the strain ""is not going to overrun or overtake"" the Kent variant that is currently the dominant type of virus in the UK, which the jabs work against. He added that ""it is not a big fright or a big surprise"" that the vaccine will need to be tweaked and some high-risk groups may need a booster, as with the flu jab. Professor Van-Tam insisted there was no evidence of a ""distinct transmissibility advantage"" and ""no reason to think the SA variant will catch up or overtake our current virus in the next few months"". Leeds footie star Olivia stepped in to help with the effort as she is also a trainee advanced practitioner in organ retrieval and transplant. She gave the Oxford jab to Mewa Singh Khela, 72, as the Centenary Pavilion at the ground opened its doors to over 70s for the vaccine. The use of Leeds' Elland Road stadium and Plymouth Argyle's Home Park for jabs follow Crystal Palace's Selhurst Park and Aston Villa's Villa Park, which were made available earlier this month. Olivia, who has volunteered to help her NHS colleagues in recent weeks, said: ""Being able to work at Elland Road is testament to Leeds as a city — and the people — that we can turn a Premier League club into a vaccination centre. ""I've done vaccinations in the community. One lady was 99 and said I was the first person outside her family she'd seen since March."""
383,383,The Sun,Harry ColeNick Gutteridge,Hated 10pm curfew will be scrapped when pubs finally reopen in May with takeaway pints from April,"THE hated 10pm curfew will not return when pubs finally reopen in May, The Sun can reveal. Boris Johnson has ordered ""a simplification"" of rules meaning punters will not have to buy a scotch egg to get served - but revellers will be encouraged to drink outdoors. Ministers have pencilled in a return for takeaway pints in April, and with pubs and bars able to reopen fully a month later. But big groups will have to stay in beer gardens and on pavements to begin with as ""ventilation is key"". Half of adult Brits will have been vaccinated by May it was confirmed last night - with 32 million over 50s and the vulnerable on target to be jabbed by the end of April. And that opens the door to pints in the Spring sunshine as soon as April, and pubs by the second Bank Holiday weekend in May. Ministers are determined for hospitality ""to open properly this time"" after many pubs were left economically unviable by the curfew and confusing tier restrictions on drinking with food. The industry said last night that 87 million pints of beer had been wasted since pandemic started, costing the beer and pub sector £331 million in rolling lockdowns and tier red tape. Emma McClarkin, Chief Executive of the British Beer & Pub Association, said: ""Our sector is in limbo. ""And at several points in the last 12 months pubs and breweries have effectively had to pour their revenues down the drain."" Complex rules varying in area to area left punters and landlords confused, and police warning they were all but unenforceable Rules on what you had to eat to get served left even ministers that drew them up struggling to clearly define what constituted ""a substantial meal."" Michael Gove memorably declared that a scotch egg would suffice, while some watering holes got away with serving tiny bowls of chips with a pint. Last night multiple Whitehall sources and ministers confirmed the ""early days'' plan, but stressed ""everything is contingent on the cases and deaths continuing to fall"". One said: ""Things that were proven to be a hindrance like 10pm drinking up, will go. If pubs are to reopen for good they've got to do it properly and can't be stuck in limbo like last year."" Another added: ""Ventilation is key to tackling the virus so expect a major push to drink outside to begin with, especially for larger groups."" The PM will set out a date for when pubs and restaurants can start to trade again when he announces the plan for ending lockdown in a speech on February 22. The first stages are likely to include adults able to exercise and mix together outside when the schools go back in March. Under the draft blueprint, activities that can take place outdoors will be prioritised as that's where the virus spreads less easily. So outside markets are set to return before high street shops, and outdoor drinking and dining will be allowed before eating indoors. The rules will be applied nationwide after ministers decided not to return to the regional system of tiers when they lift restrictions. So far only the earliest date schools can return has been agreed formally, but others measures are being drawn up by officials with Ministers due to sign them off in the coming days and weeks. But hopes of drinking in the sunshine were given a major boost by the confirmation half of UK Adults will have been vaccinated by the end of April. 32 million jabs for the over 50s and the vulnerable had been promised by the Spring - but the Cabinet Office confirmed today that means ""by May."" The admission came as they confirmed local elections would take place that month despite some Covid restrictions likely to be in place. They said: ""The UK's vaccination programme is planned to have reached all nine priority cohorts by May, meaning that the Government can commit to go ahead with these polls with confidence."" JCVI priority groups 1-9 are estimated to cover around 27 million people in England and 32 million people across the UK. On Thursday Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi had said Britain will be able to massively ease restrictions once all over-50s have been offered the jab ""by late spring"". But Downing Street had repeatedly refused to say when they believed Spring to end and Summer start. And the end of April target is even more ambitious than lockdown sceptical Tory backbenchers had hoped. Mark Harper — chairman of the Covid Recovery Group of lockdown sceptics, with 70 Tory MPs — had said: ""Back-of-the-envelope calculations I did based on two million doses a week mean you could get the top nine priority groups, first doses, and the top four groups, second doses, all done by the end of May."" He added: ""So it seems to me by the time you get to the end of May, no later than that, you should be in a position to get rid of restrictions completely. But last night Matt Hancock confirmed the May target in an interview with Sky News. The Health Secretary said: ""My plan is that we should be able to offer a vaccine to everybody in categories one to nine - that's all the over-50s - by May. ""Lots of things have got to go right to hit that goal, especially supply, which is the rate-limiting factor, but I'm sure, working with the NHS and everybody else who is making this happen, that if we keep going at the pace we can, then we can make sure all the over-50s get the offer of a vaccine by May."""

And the end of April target is even more ambitious than lockdown sceptical Tory backbenchers had hoped. Mark Harper — chairman of the Covid Recovery Group of lockdown sceptics, with 70 Tory MPs — said: ""Back-of-the-envelope calculations I did based on two million doses a week mean you could get the top nine priority groups, first doses, and the top four groups, second doses, all done by the end of May."" He added: ""So it seems to me by the time you get to the end of May, no later than that, you should be in a position to get rid of restrictions completely. ""But obviously it does depend on the rollout of the vaccine."" It comes after NHS chief Sir Simon Stevens said the same thing earlier this month. Speaking to MPs on the public accounts committee, he said: ""This is a sprint to mid-February [to vaccinate the four highest priority groups] and then it will be a sprint from mid-February through to the end of April to extend the vaccination to the rest of the higher risk groups identified by the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation. ""Then it will be a marathon from April into the autumn . . . where we are offering everybody in the country who wants it, over the age of 18 for whom the vaccines are authorised, that jab."" Another member told The Sun the group backed Mr Harper's call for restrictions to be totally torn up in May if over-50s have been immunised by then. The UK vaccinated another 469,016 people on Wednesday, meaning nearly 10.5 million Brits have now received their first dose of the jab. Deaths have also dropped by a quarter with 915 recorded yesterday and 20,634 daily infections. And Mr Zahawi was ""confident"" the country will hit its target of offering a jab to all 15 million of the most vulnerable by mid-February. The vaccines chief said that once all over-50s are vaccinated, Britain will be able to tear up many of the draconian restrictions which have turned lives upside down. He said: ""We want to reopen schools, reopen our economy, get our lives back, but never have to go back into another severe lockdown like the one we're all experiencing and suffering from at the moment. ""You've got to make sure that your vaccination programme has protected the top nine categories in phase one — that is 99 per cent of mortality."" The Government has vowed to do this by ""late spring"". No10 has vowed to offer all adults a vaccine by September. But there are early signs that the turbocharged vaccination programme is going so well the UK could beat its targets. There is also hope that with 60 per cent of the country vaccinated, Britain could effectively achieve herd immunity by July. Experts from University College London say the R rate is already down to 0.75 — the lowest it has been since the first lockdown. Research by Prof Karl Friston suggests a combination of Covid jabs, natural immunity and better weather will bring an end to the pandemic in the UK. Prof Friston said that was a ""realistic"" forecast of the nation's progress against the bug. He told The Sun: ""It is not concerned with the worst case scenarios — but the most likely case."" And Prof Andrew Hayward, of the Sage government advisory body, said: ""We will be more or less back to normal for the summer."""
385,385,The Sun,Harry ColeChris Musson,Nicola Sturgeon under fire for saying the UK’s jab rollout success has little to do with Brexit,"EUROFAN Nicola Sturgeon was ridiculed last night after insisting that Brexit had nothing to do with the UK's soaring vaccine rollout. Despite bungling by Brussels meaning the EU27 are struggling to jab their citizens, the SNP boss - who wants to re-join the bloc - said it was ""too simplistic"" to suggest leaving the EU has made the UK more nimble. The First Minister's remarks came amid anger over low vaccination rates in the European Union and claims Brussels bureaucracy has stifled the buy-up of jabs. Last July, the SNP said the UK's refusal to join the EU scheme as ""idiotic"", ""all about Brexit"", and would ""cost lives"". But the UK - which went its own way on procurement - is now way ahead of the bloc. Quizzed on the issue yesterday, Europhile Ms Sturgeon said it was ""really good"" the UK had managed to get so much vaccine and that ""the UK as a whole is getting ahead"" . Questioned on Good Morning Britain about whether Brexit had helped, she said: ""Of course you can make that argument but sometimes I think it's a slightly over-simplistic argument, but we should all be pleased that the vaccination programme is going so well."" She added: ""The issues around Brexit are much wider and more fundamental but even on this narrow point I think if you were to apply really detailed scrutiny it wouldn't be quite that simple."" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: ""The UK Government's vaccine programme has been such a tremendous success that a million doses are available to the Scottish Government on overnight delivery - and more are on the way. ""Analysis shows that if the UK had followed the SNP's advice and opted-in to the EU scheme, we would have about half a million fewer people vaccinated in Scotland. ""The First Minister's laughable attempt today at spinning the UK's success as 'too simplistic' is just another example of how petty the SNP have been at acknowledging the benefits of being in the UK, not the EU scheme."""
386,386,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Family demand Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab ‘come clean’ after Harry Dunn crash driver spy bombshell,"BORIS Johnson and Dominic Raab must ""come absolutely clean"" about when they learnt the killer of Harry Dunn was a secret US spy, the dead teenager's family have demanded. Lawyers representing American mum-of-three Anne Sacoolas sensationally admitted in a US Court that she was a intelligence agent. Sacoolas fled Britain after a fatal smash with the 19 year old motorcyclist outside RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire in August 2019. She was driving on the wrong side of the road but claimed diplomatic immunity as her husband worked at the US spy base. But on Wednesday night,  the Alexandria district court in Virginia was told Anne Sacoolas was ""employed by an intelligence agency in the US"" at the time of the fatal  collision - which was ""especially a factor"" in her flight from the UK. Her lawyer said she fled the country due to ""issues of security"". The Sun understands she had a ""high flying career"" in the CIA. The bombshell revelations came out during Sacoolas's bid to dismiss a civil claim for damages against her made by the late Harry's family. The suspect's lawyer, John McGavin, told the court he could not ""completely candidly"" explain why the Sacoolas family left the UK - adding: ""I know the answer, but I cannot disclose it."" Sacoolas's career in espionage was first revealed by the Press last year, but the US or UK government have never commented - and Sacoolas herself had remained tight lipped until now. Harry's grieving family have been kept in the dark for more than a year by the Foreign Office despite many pleas for information. Last night the family said Harry's father asked the Foreign Secretary ""point blank in a meeting"" at the FCO in January 2020 whether or not Mrs Sacoolas was working at the time of the crash. But Mr Raab's response was that ""she used to work for the State Department."" The family's spokesman Radd Seiger told The Sun: ""We now call on Mr Raab to come absolutely clean to the parents and the British public about what he knew about Mrs Sacoolas' employment status, when he became aware of it."" ""And what are the British Government is now going to do following this astonishing revelation to help the parents once and for all to get Justice for Harry?"" And Harry's mum Charlotte Charles told ITV News: ""I'll never trust any of them again."" And she said Mr Raab ""should completely reevaluate the position he holds."" ""It's beyond belief, the amount of times we've met with them,"" she said. ""We should have been properly grieving in those first few months, we should have been given the chance. We deserve the truth. Who the hell have we got running the country?"" Both President Trump and President Biden have rejected British requests to extradite her back to face justice. Probed on whether the US had ""pulled a fast one"" on the UK over withholding information about Sacoolas from the government, No10 told reporters: ""we don't comment on intelligence matters"". But a spokesman insisted ""she was notified to the UK Government by the US as a spouse with no official role"". ""I would emphasise that our position on this case remains unchanged, we have consistently called for her diplomatic immunity to be waived and believe that the US refusal to extradite her amounts to a denial of justice."""
387,387,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Ofcom bans China’s State TV from British airwaves amid ‘propaganda’ row,"CHINA's state-owned broadcaster has been zapped from British screens amid a row over the influence of the increasingly isolated Communist regime in Beijing. TV regulator Ofcom revoked China Global Television Network's right to broadcast after a year-long probe into political influence on the station. The move follows a £200,000 fine for Kremlin-backed Russia Today for biased broadcasting in 2019. And it comes amid growing tension between the UK and the super state over Hong Kong, genocide claims and truth behind the Covid-19 outbreak. Ofcom ruled that the English-language news channel's owners Star China Media Limited were not in control of its editorial output, and rejected an attempt to change owners amid the row. The quango said on Thursday that the company was ""ultimately controlled by the Chinese Communist Party."" ""The days of Beijing's genocide-denying, democracy-trampling propaganda are over."" They insisted that they had given the channel ""significant time to come into compliance with the statutory rules"" but ""those efforts have now been exhausted."" In a statement they said: ""Following careful consideration, taking account of all the facts and the broadcaster's and audience's rights to freedom of expression, we have decided it is appropriate to revoke the licence for CGTN to broadcast in the UK."" In 2020, Ofcom found CGTN had breached the broadcasting code by failing to preserve due impartiality in its coverage of the Hong Kong protests. Tonight the move was welcomed by anti-China voices as a victory against ""propaganda."" Conservative MP Bob Seeley of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China said it was ""the right move."" He added: ""It cannot be correct that an arm of a regime that doesn't recognise rights to freedom of speech at home is allowed to break UK laws in order to peddle its propaganda on the airwaves."" And Foreign policy think-tank the Henry Jackson Society told The Sun: ""The days of Beijing's genocide-denying, democracy-trampling propaganda are over."" They added: ""The Communist commissars should have no voice on our airwaves. The only question is why it took so long for Ofcom to act."" And the boss of the Commons media committee Julian Knight welcomed the decision as ""a strong warning"" to others. ""Today's ruling is confirmation that the Chinese Communist Party is the ultimate controller of its broadcasts which is not permitted under UK law. ""CGTN had already breached broadcasting codes with a forced confession, and failure on impartiality over coverage of the Hong Kong protests. The Tory MP went on: ""It should be seen as a strong warning that the power to broadcast carries with it responsibility and accountability. Failing this bar will not be tolerated."" An Ofcom spokeswoman said: ""Our investigation showed that the licence for China Global Television Network is held by an entity which has no editorial control over its programmes. ""We are unable to approve the application to transfer the licence to China Global Television Network Corporation because it is ultimately controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, which is not permitted under UK broadcasting law. ""We've provided CGTN with numerous opportunities to come into compliance, but it has not done so. We now consider it appropriate to withdraw the licence for CGTN to broadcast in the UK."""
388,388,The Sun,Nick McDermottHarry ColeEllie Cambridge,Covid vaccine rollout reaches TEN MILLION mark as Britain officially passes peak of second wave,"TEN million Brits have now been vaccinated against Covid - as the UK officially passed the peak of the second wave. Health Secretary Matt Hancock yesterday hailed the ""hugely significant milestone"", saying: ""Every jab makes us all a bit safer. I want to thank everyone playing their part."" One in five adults have now had their first dose of a Covid vaccine. And it comes as Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said the UK had passed the peak of the second wave for cases, hospital admissions and deaths. Last night PM Boris Johnson led the nation in clapping for the NHS and fundraising legend Captain Tom Moore, who died of the virus aged 100 on Tuesday. He quoted Captain Tom Moore's ""Tomorrow will be a good day"" catchphrase. The NHS is now well on course to vaccinate 15million of the highest-risk Brits by mid-February. The PM also hailed new research that shows the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine appears to reduce transmission of the coronavirus — and offers 76 per cent protection even after three months. Every jab makes us all a bit safer. I want to thank everyone playing their part. Just one dose of the Pfizer/ BioNTech jab is also highly protective — giving 90 per cent Covid protection after 21 days. Ministers are ecstatic that their gamble to delay giving the elderly a second jab for three months — so more people get their first — appears to have paid off. The NHS doled out 374,756 first doses on Tuesday, taking the national total to 10,021,471. Chief medical officer Professor Whitty declared that we are ""past the peak"" of the second wave as deaths and case numbers continue to fall. ""I think that most of my colleagues think we are past the peak,"" Prof Whitty told a Downing Street press conference. ""Now that doesn't mean you could never have another peak. But, at this point in time, provided people continue to follow the guidelines, we're on the downward slope of cases, of hospitalisations and of deaths, in all four of the nations of the United Kingdom. ""So I think, we do think, at this point, this peak at least, we are past."" And jabs that protect against the new mutant strains will be ready by autumn. But the PM warned of lifting lockdown too soon. Speaking at No10, he said: ""If we stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives, then in the words of Captain Tom, 'Tomorrow will be a good day'."" Mr Johnson also stuck to his February 22 date to set out a ""route map"" out of lockdown. And despite mounting pressure from MPs to go faster, he insisted that March 8 is a ""prudent"" date to begin lifting any measures — starting with schools. But he said, thanks to vaccines, the country would be in a ""very different situation"" to last summer — where disease levels had been reduced but there was no defence. If we stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives, then in the words of Captain Tom, 'Tomorrow will be a good day'. Nearly nine in ten over-75s have now had their first jab. A further 39 mass vaccination hubs and 65 more pharmacies will open this week. Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said: ""The programme is in full swing and almost one in five adults are already protected from serious illness."" Professor Lawrence Young, at Warwick University, said: ""We should soon see its impact on reducing levels of hospitalisation and mortality. An effect on transmission will also be evident. It is vital we continue at this pace."" Epidemiology expert Professor Keith Neal, at Nottingham University, added: ""We now know that a single dose provides significant protection and very likely will reduce transmission. ""To produce a brand new vaccine in bulk this quickly is a major achievement."" Around 90 fire crew will help dish out jabs at Basingstoke station — one of the new hubs. Other sites include Crystal Palace's Selhurst Park, the Royal Cornwall Showground and Chelmsford Racecourse, Essex. It means over-70s can now get their jab at more than 1,500 NHS-run sites in England. National medical director Professor Stephen Powis said: ""These new sites will mean even more people live nearby to a large-scale centre or community pharmacy. ""Along with the incredible work of our local GPs, pharmacists and their healthcare teams, this will allow us to rapidly vaccinate the most vulnerable in our society."" Professor Andrew Pollard, chief investigator of the Oxford vaccine trial, said work on updated jabs against three worrying variants detected in the UK has begun. All have the E484K mutation, which scientists fear reduces the protection provided by current jabs. Prof Pollard explained: ""Work on designing a new vaccine is very, very quick. It's essentially just switching out the genetic sequence for the spike protein for the updated variants. ""Then there's manufacturing and a small-scale study. All that can be completed in a short time."" AstraZeneca's Sir Mene Pangalos added: ""Our ambition is to be ready for the next round of immunisations that may be necessary for next winter. We're very much aiming to have something ready by the autumn."" Yesterday, Home Secretary Priti Patel revealed her parents Sushil and Anjana, in their 70s, had the vaccine last week. Ms Patel, at Neasden Temple, North West London, told The Sun: ""I say to everybody from every ethnic background; when you get the call, text or GP's letter, come down to your vaccination site and get the jab. It'll save your life."" Meanwhile, a £7million government-funded study to test the body's response to different jabs starts recruiting volunteers today. If successful, it could allow people to gain better anti-body protection and make vaccine rollouts faster and more flexible. Oxford University scientists will give 820 people, aged over 50, either a combination of the Oxford/AstraZeneca or Pfizer/BioNTech jab, or the same for both doses. Some volunteers will get second doses four weeks apart, and others three months on. The results are expected in June and are likely to influence vaccine delivery globally. Associate professor Matthew Snape, chief investigator on the trial, said: ""'If we do show that these vaccines can be used interchangeably in the same schedule, this will greatly increase the flexibility of vaccine delivery — and could provide clues as to how to increase the breadth of protection against new strains."" TEN million jabs. A magnificent milestone. A triumph for Britain. How is the EU responding? With further attempts to undermine our Oxford vaccine with falsehoods about its safety. But its panicking leaders look more reckless and self-serving by the day. Early evidence indicates the AstraZeneca jab slashes transmission of Covid as well as the numbers hospitalised or dying. That is vital for a rapid end to our lockdown and the return of more normal life. It will mean the virus finding fewer and fewer people to infect. If our rollout continues at its current stellar pace, the daily death toll is soon likely to begin falling. Cases and hospitalisations should drop like a stone once those below 70 start getting jabs. The Oxford vaccine may prove the key to our economy reopening fully before many of those abroad. Behind its bluster and disinformation, Brussels is ashamed it has secured so few doses. Rightly so. Because the consequences of its folly look increasingly dire."
389,389,The Sun,Harry Cole,British punters bet £2.8bn on black market bookies last year – twice as much as two years ago,"BRITISH punters are using black market bookies twice as much as just two years ago, a shocking new report reveals. More than £2.8bn was staked with unlicensed operators on the web last year, up from £1.4billion in 2019, according to accounting giants PWC. Their new data also shows the number of customers using an unlicensed betting website has grown from 210,000 two years ago to 460,000. It comes as the Betting and Gaming Council warns of ""the dangers of complacency"" about the threat from unlicensed and illegal gambling operators - amid fears more regulation of bookies will drive even more punters into the arms of the wild west online. Boss Michael Dugher told The Sun: ""This new report by the PWC is an impressive and comprehensive piece of work which demonstrates how the unsafe, unregulated black market is a growing threat to British punters."" ""These illicit sites have none of the regulated sector's consumer protections in place, such as strict ID and age verification checks, safer gambling messages and the ability to set deposit limits."" The Government is currently undertaking a review of gambling, with fears that tougher regulation could drive more punters into the arms of unregulated bookies. Mr Dugher added: ""I know this evidence is inconvenient to those who seek to dismiss and play down the threat of the black market, but there is a real danger of complacency. ""The UK risks sleep walking into changes where the main beneficiary is the unlicensed black market. ""We all have an interest in getting future changes right, so must take heed of this latest evidence and look at what is happening elsewhere around the world."" On the number of British punters using black market sites, the PWC report says: ""Based on our survey, the proportion of UK online gamblers using an unlicensed operator has increased from 2.2 per cent to 4.5 per cent in the last 1-2 years. ""This equates to an increase from c210,000 players in 2018-19 to c460,000 in 2020."" It goes on: ""A sizable and growing share of stakes is placed with unlicensed sites, growing over the last 1-2 years broadly in line with usage (ie doubling). ""Those that gamble with unlicensed operators still almost always gamble with licensed operators as well. ""Our survey found that share of online stakes with unlicensed operators had grown from 1.2 per cent in 2018/19 to 2.3 per cent. ""This corresponds to a doubling of stakes with unlicensed online operators from £1.4bn to £2.8bn."""
390,390,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha ClarkDan Keane,Captain Sir Tom Moore: Boris Johnson leads nation in clap to honour war hero and NHS,"BRITAIN saluted hero Captain Sir Tom Moore last night with doorstep applause ringing out across the nation. The 6pm tribute was led by Boris Johnson standing outside 10 Downing Street with partner Carrie Symonds. Follow the latest news and tributes to Captain Tom Moore on our live blog... And among those joining in were Captain Tom's daughter Hannah, grandchildren Benji and Georgia and son-in-law Colin in Marston Moretaine, Beds. The family were said to be ""incredibly touched"" and Hannah was seen to wipe away a tear during the emotional tribute. There was also clapping at Premier League matches and at Bedford hospital, where he died from Covid on Tuesday, aged 100. Troops took part outside the Army Foundation College in Harrogate, North Yorks — where Captain Tom was made an honorary colonel last year. He had captured the country's hearts by raising £39million for NHS Charities Together by walking laps of his garden. There are now calls for a permanent memorial to Captain Tom — such as a statue or renaming a hospital. Ahead of the applause, a minute's silence had been held in the Commons to remember him and all who have died in the pandemic. Echoing his catchphrase, PM Mr Johnson told MPs: ""Captain Sir Tom Moore dedicated his life to serving his country and others. ""His was a long life, lived well whether during his time defending our nation, his time as an Army officer, or last year bringing the country together through his incredible fundraising drive for the NHS. ""As Captain Tom repeatedly reminded us, tomorrow will be a good day. ""He inspired the very best in us all and his legacy will continue to do so for generations to come."" Later last night, Home Secretary Priti Patel told The Sun Captain Tom was a ""hero for everybody"". She said: ""He was a light of inspiration at a time we have suffered a great deal individually and nationally over the last 12 months. ""He lifted the soul of the nation."" The Sun can reveal the Ministry of Defence is looking at plans for a ceremonial funeral. And the news comes as a Sun survey showed 57 per cent want a hospital named in his honour. Chris Curtis, of pollsters Opinium, said: ""It demonstrates the positive and uplifting impact Captain Tom has had."" Heart radio presenter and Britain's Got Talent judge Amanda Holden launched a petition for a statue outside Parliament. Writing on the Change. org website, she described Captain Tom as ""a national hero who brought us all together and shone so much light in such a dark time"". She continued: ""Let's show generations to come what it was to be brave, courageous and spirited with a statue of Captain Sir Tom Moore outside the Houses of Parliament forever more."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock described Captain Tom as an ""inspiration"" and he promised: ""I will ensure we mark his contribution properly and appropriately at the right moment."" Last night, the PM said he ""absolutely"" backed calls for a permanent memorial to Captain Tom. Mr Johnson told a No10 press conference: ""We will be working with his family to see what is best to take forward."" HOW moving last night's national clap for Captain Tom was. And how fitting it would be if a major hospital was renamed after him. Better still, a new one built in his memory. There are many excellent suggestions for marking the life and legacy of the 100-year-old war hero who raised so much for NHS staff and rallied the nation in the early days of this crisis. But we have no doubt he would have preferred a new hospital to any number of statues or plaques . . . No matter how much his admirable feats deserved those accolades too."
391,391,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha Clark,Sir Captain Tom Moore: Boris Johnson to lead clap for war hero and NHS at 6pm TONIGHT,"BRITAIN will come together at 6pm tonight to clap hero Captain Tom and his beloved NHS. The war veteran, 100, who raised £32million for the NHS, died yesterday following a battle with Covid and pneumonia. Follow the latest news and tributes to Captain Tom Moore on our live blog... Brits are being urged to take to their doorsteps to celebrate Captain Tom's legacy and the tens of millions he raised. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will lead the clapping from 10 Downing Street this evening and today urged as many as possible to come out and show their respects. The fundraising legend's family are supporting the moment to honour his brilliant life A tweet from Captain Sir Tom Moore's Twitter account said they were ""incredibly touched"" his memory will be honoured with a national clap. The tweet said: ""They will be taking part with huge love in their hearts for their father, grandfather and father-in-law."" The clap every Thursday became a tradition during the first lockdown as Brits took to their windows, doorsteps and balconies to thank those working on the Covid frontline. It returned last month as the UK was plunged into a third lockdown - with the event renamed Clap for Heroes. Boris told the Commons: ""We all now have the opportunity to show our appreciation for him and all that he stood for and believed in. ""That is why I encourage everyone to join in a national clap for Captain Tom and all those health workers for whom he raised money at 6pm this evening.""

Around 57 per cent say they support the idea according to a survey done overnight the pollsters Opinium. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Defence are looking at plans for a ceremonial funeral for Captain Tom Moore, The Sun can reveal. Ministers have given their blessing to military honours for the late 100-year-old legend. Home Secretary Priti Patel said Captain Tom was a  ""hero for everybody. ""She said:  ""We'll all be standing by and clapping for him this evening at 6pm as the Prime Minister has announced.

""I think all of us will think of him very fondly and really cherish the work that he did throughout the pandemic to raise funds, but also to lift the soul of the nation in the way which he did."" And Health Secretary Matt Hancock said his contribution will be formally marked. Describing him as an ""inspiration"", the minister said: ""I will ensure we mark his contribution properly and appropriately at the right moment."" Asked whether a statue might be built ""in possibly his home town or where he was born or in London"", Mr Hancock told LBC: ""Yes, I do think that we should find a way, at the right time, to honour the contribution that he made to the NHS and he was an inspiration to so many people."" Captain Tom's daughters yesterday announced the war hero had tragically passed away in hospital. Hannah and Lucy said in a touching statement: ""It is with great sadness that we announce the death of our dear father, Captain Sir Tom Moore. ""We are so grateful that we were with him during the last hours of his life; Hannah, Benjie and Georgia by his bedside and Lucy on FaceTime. We spent hours chatting to him, reminiscing about our childhood and our wonderful mother. We shared laughter and tears together. ""The last year of our father's life was nothing short of remarkable. He was rejuvenated and experienced things he'd only ever dreamed of. ""Whilst he'd been in so many hearts for just a short time, he was an incredible father and grandfather, and he will stay alive in our hearts forever."" His grieving daughters praised the ""extraordinary"" NHS and carers who helped their father in the last weeks and year of his life. They branded them ""unfalteringly professional, kind and compassionate"" and thanked them for ""giving us many more years with him than we ever would have imagined"". The statement added: ""Over the past few days our father spoke a great deal about the last 12 months and how proud he felt at being able to leave behind the growing legacy of his Foundation. ""We politely ask for privacy at this time so we can grieve quietly as a family and remember the wonderful 100 years our father had. ""Thank you."" The hero, who became a beacon of hope as coronavirus first gripped the world, fell ill with pneumonia and last week tested positive for the disease. His daughter Hannah said on Sunday her dad was not in intensive care as she thanked medical staff for doing ""all they can"" to make him comfortable. Bedford Hospital said Capt Sir Tom had been joined at his bedside by members of his family. The Queen had led tributes to the hero today and is sending a private message of condolence to his family. A Buckingham Palace spokesman: ""Her Majesty very much enjoyed meeting Cpt Sir Tom and his family at Windsor last year. ""Her thoughts, and those of the Royal Family, are with them, recognising the inspiration he provided for the whole nation and others across the world."" Boris Johnson called him a ""hero in the truest sense of the word"" as he also offered his sympathies. The PM spoke to Captain Sir Tom's daughter Hannah this afternoon to pass on his condolences and offer any support the family may need. The flag above No10 has been lowered to half mast to honour the veteran. Mr Johnson said: ""Captain Sir Tom Moore was a hero in the truest sense of the word. ""In the dark days of the Second World War he fought for freedom and in the face of this country's deepest post war crisis he united us all, he cheered us all up, and he embodied the triumph of the human spirit. ""It is quite astonishing that at the age of 100 he raised more than £32 million for the NHS, and so gave countless others their own chance to thank the extraordinary men and women who have protected us through the pandemic. ""He became not just a national inspiration but a beacon of hope for the world. Our thoughts are with his daughter Hannah and all his family. "" The war veteran won the hearts of the nation with his bid to raise money for NHS staff before his 100th birthday on April 30 last year. His aim was to raise £1,000 walking 100 laps of the 25-metre (82ft) loop in his garden with the aid of a frame. The champ then vowed to keep on walking while people were still donating after he achieved the amazing feat on April 16. Staggeringly, he went on to raise £32,796,355 for NHS charities and received a knighthood from the Queen."
392,392,The Sun,Harry ColeNick GutteridgeNatasha ClarkKate Ferguson,Boris Johnson & Sir Keir Starmer in fiery Commons ‘bust-up’ as Labour leader ‘has a meltdown’ after PMQs jabs clash,"SIR Keir Starmer and Boris Johnson had a heated exchange after PMQs, The Sun can reveal. The livid Labour leader confronted the PM as the pair left the Commons chamber after their weekly bout, with eyewitnesses claiming Sir Keir ""had a bit of a meltdown"". One MP who witnessed the exchange said: ""He was clearly very rattled and kept saying to the PM 'it's not true, it's not true'"". Another claimed Sir Keir was ""almost puce"" and ""wagged his finger aggressively"" at Mr Johnson. It's understood Sir Keir was enraged after the PM highlighted the opposition boss's previous support for staying in the European Medicines Agency. Britain deliberately broke away from the European Medicines Agency control for vaccine approval in October - meaning the UK could rubber stamp the jabs quicker - Matt Hancock claimed last year. But the bloc decided to take an EU-wide approach to getting the jabs, which took longer and meant Brussels is far behind the UK's rollout of the vaccine. Staying in the EU's agency would have likely put Britain back months. Brussels has been desperately trying to claw vaccines supplies to the bloc and has got into a nasty spat with both Britain and the drugs firm AstraZeneca over supplies. The pair had the exchange of words just by the voting lobbies at the entrance to the House of Commons earlier this afternoon. Another MP said: ""As I walked past they were in a heated discussion about what had just happened by the entrance to the Aye lobby."" Another eyewitness told The Sun: ""Starmer kept claiming wanting to join the EMA was 'nothing to do with the vaccine', and the PM kept saying 'check the record, you said it.'"" A third MP added: ""Keir fronted up to the PM after PMQs in the entrance to the Chamber - no mask, not socially distanced either, to say that the PM was wrong about the EMA. ""The PM tried to close it down by saying it's on the record."" They said around a dozen MPs gathered around, with one Tory wading in to prove the Labour leader had made the remarks. One eyewitness even claimed Sir Keir was so angry that he eventually had to be led away by Labour whip Chris Mathieson, but he disputed that. Mr Matieson said: ""There was a brief chat and then Keir and I left together. Nothing more to it than that."" However Tory MP Mark Francois disputed the ""reasonable conversation claim."" He told The Sun: ""As I was walking out of the chamber, I saw Sir Keir and PM standing near the entrance to the aye lobby."" ""He was puce with anger, and wagging his finger aggressively at the PM, who was telling him to check the record."" During the exchange it is claimed Sir Keir had admitted that he previously wanted to Brexit Britain to joined the EU's medical agency, but that had nothing do with the vaccine. Moments earlier he had accused the PM of being dishonest in the House of Commons - by claiming he had wanted to joined the EMA. Sir Keir said: ""The Prime Minister knows I have never said that, from this Despatch Box or anywhere else, but the truth escapes him."" But official parliamentary records from January 2017 show Sir Keir DID say the UK should stay in the EMA. And video shows he said in the House of Commons in January 2017: ""Why would we want to be outside the European Medicines Agency, which ensures that all medicines in the EU market are safe and effective?"" In another exchange he said: ""If you let me give three, without the details The European Aviation Safety Agency, The European Medicines Agency.. and of course Europol which I worked with for many years... ""These are the bits of the EU which we should be seeking to retain, not to throw away."" Tonight he finally backed down and admitted he was wrong - and he had made such comments in the past. A spokeswoman for Sir Keir said: ""On a number of occasions the Prime Minister has wrongly claimed that Labour wanted to join the EU's vaccine programme. That is inaccurate and the claim has been found to be untrue. ""This afternoon during Prime Minister's Questions, Keir misheard the Prime Minister and assumed he was making the same false accusation again. ""Keir accepts that, on this occasion, the Prime Minister was referring to old comments about the European Medicines Agency and Keir admits he was wrong and made a mistake in his response. ""It's not Labour policy to join either the European Medicines Agency or the EU vaccine programme. We have never called for the UK to be in the EU vaccine programme. We remain committed to working with the Government to ensure we can be the first in the world to roll out the vaccine."" Sir Keir's spokesman said he was ""not aware of the incident"" but a Labour source attempted to play it down. saying it was ""a perfectly reasonable conversation."" Downing Street have been approached for comment. During a briefing for Westminster journalists the Prime Minister's press secretary said she was not in a position to confirm or deny the incident as she had not seen the PM since. The bust up came following a tetchy PMQs at which the pair traded barbs over the UK's jabs rollout. Labour's leader got himself into hot water by claiming he had never called for Britain to stay in the EU's medicines agency. The PM quoted past remarks Sir Keir had made questioning why the UK was leaving the body. He said: ""If we had listened to [Sir Keir] we would still be at the starting blocks because he wanted to stay in the European Medicines Agency and said so four times from that despatch box. But in ill-tempered scenes the Labour leader responded: ""Complete nonsense. Don't let the truth get in the way of a pre-prepared gag. ""The Prime Minister knows I've never said that, from this despatch box or anywhere else, the truth escapes him."" Boris was caught pulling faces and puffed his cheeks in response to the answer. Tory MP Mark Francois later raised a point of order in a bid to correct the record and highlight the Labour leader's previous remarks. The row came after the pair also clashed over whether the PM had ignored advice from scientists to shut Britain's borders. Sir Keir claimed No 10 overruled Sage by refusing to put in place a blanket hotel quarantine system for all arrivals. But the PM shot back: ""Actually, Sage did not recommend a complete ban and they say travel bans should not be relied upon to stop the importation of new variants. ""But we do have one of the toughest regimes in the world."""
393,393,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Boris Johnson’s government ‘chides’ Nicola Sturgeon for letting the side down with Scotland’s slow vaccination pace,"BORIS Johnson's government appeared to chide Nicola Sturgeon for letting the side down with Scotland's slow vaccination pace last night. And ministers offered to help ""accelerate"" the pace north of the border with more resources from the UK government - in a move that risked infuriating the nationalists. As the UK hit the ten million jabs mark, the Westminster government wrote to the SNP boss to say ""it is in everyone's interests that progress in vaccinating the people of Scotland matches the best efforts of the rest of UK"". Scottish Secretary Alister Jack added: ""With that in mind, we stand ready to offer any support or assistance we can give you to accelerate your rollout programme."" Of the 4.4million adults in Scotland to be vaccinated, so far 610,778 have received the first jab. However Ms Sturgeon accepted that her government did want to ""accelerate the overall progress"" of the campaign. She reported to MSPs that just under 35,000 first doses were administered on Monday - the highest daily total so far, and 55 per cent more than the number of injections given on the same day last week. But Scottish Conservative Holyrood leader Ruth Davidson noted that on Sunday January 31, ""Scotland saw the lowest number of jabs administered since the start of the mass rollout over a month ago"". She hit out at the First Minister and said: ""At the moment, all the evidence shows the Scottish government's rollout is slow, stuttering and lagging way behind the rest of the UK."" While just over a fifth of 75-79-year-olds in Scotland have been vaccinated, Ms Davidson said that was ""just a quarter of the proportion vaccinated south of the border"" for the same age group. The Scottish government's rollout is slow, stuttering and lagging way behind the rest of the UK. Mr Jack urged Ms Sturgeon to accept assistance, saying: ""I strongly believe that to put the nightmare of Covid-19 behind us as quickly as possible, we must collaborate as closely as possible."" Ms Sturgeon insisted that going forward the number of injections given will increase ""as we make more use of mass vaccination centres for the younger age groups"". Two new mass vaccination centres opened in Scotland on Monday, in Edinburgh and Aberdeen. The First Minister said: ""I'm not standing here denying we want to accelerate the overall progress."" ""But nor will I apologise for having deliberately focused on maximising uptake in the most clinically vulnerable groups."" Cabinet Minister Jacob Rees Mogg said the offer of help was a clear sign of the ""benefits of the United Kingdom""."
394,394,The Sun,Harry Cole,Covid lockdown may be lifted in all of England at same time with schools open first and more adults allowed to meet up,"BORIS Johnson now wants to ditch regional tiers and have all of England gradually unlock together - starting next month with some year groups back in school and more exercise for adults. After a gruelling political battle putting the regional traffic lights system in place last year, No10 are paving the way to abandon they system amid fears some regions will fall behind. While just last week the Government publicly said a return to tiers was on the cards, the Prime Minister declared yesterday he was ""keeping an open mind."" A final decision will be made in the next three weeks, with the PM vowing to set out his road map out of lockdown around the 22 February, with restrictions hopefully starting to ease on 8 March But buoyed by stonking vaccine numbers and declining hospital stats, Mr Johnson said he was ""optimistic"" his plan would mean some normality by the summer holidays. Visiting a vaccine hub in Batley, West Yorkshire yesterday he said: ""It may be that a national approach, going down the tiers in a national way, might be better this time round, given that the disease is behaving much more nationally."" ""If you look at the way the new variant has taken off across the country, it's a pretty national phenomenon."" Mr Johnson added: ""The charts I see, we're all sort of moving pretty much in the same sort of way, I mean there are a few discrepancies, a few differences, so it may be that we will go for a national approach but there may be an advantage still in some regional differentiation as well."" Areas like Greater Manchester were locked in vicious turf wars with Westminster in a bid to avoid the toughest restrictions last autumn, with No10 keen to avoid a repeat of such rolling battles. And sources told The Sun Mr Johnson worries that some areas will take longer to recover in a blow to his ""levelling up"" agenda unless the country has freedoms restored together. Insiders say it will be a ""snails pace unlocking"" with more adults allowed to meet up outside for exercise or sport the first likely step after schools starting to reopen. Before the national lockdown enforced since the beginning of January, most of the country was in strict Tier 4, where shops and pubs were shut. They could do click and collect and takeaway in Tier 3, and punters had to order a substantial meal to drink in Tier 2. You also had to sit outside if you wanted to drink with another household. Only the loosest Tier 1 restrictions allowed meeting up indoors - capped at six people."
395,395,The Sun,Nick McDermottHarry Cole,Novavax vaccine – New 89% effective Covid jab works on UK and South Africa strains – and we’ve ordered 60m,"A NEW Covid jab for Britain is effective in 89.3 per cent of cases, it was revealed last night. Sixty million doses of the Novavax vaccine will be produced on Teesside — as the EU is trying to scupper exports of jabs. The drug, shown in UK trials to be effective against the Kent variant of Covid, was hailed by PM Boris Johnson. Britain's incredible vaccine campaign got a triple boost with the news of 150million extra jabs. The Government has secured 60million doses of the drug — which experts said was also 85.6 per cent effective against the sweeping UK variant of Covid-19. The Sun can reveal results of trials for the one-shot US Janssen vaccine are expected imminently — with Britain having ordered 30million doses. A French firm is using a Scottish factory to produce another 60million doses of a promising vaccine. It means 120million of the extra jabs will be UK-produced. It came as figures showed 7,447,199 Brits have now received their first does, and 476,298 have had their second. The Novavax jab's 89.3 per cent efficacy in UK trials was called ""spectacular"" by expert Clive Dix. It is likely to be approved next month and will be manufactured in Stockton-on-Tees for use this summer. The factory, owned by Fujifilm, has capacity to ramp up production to 180million doses. Novavax boss Stanley Erck said it has been shown to work against ""UK and South Africa variants"". Vaccine Minister Nadhim Zahawi, one of 15,000 UK volunteers to take part in the Novavax trials, said: ""I am particularly thrilled to see such positive results."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""If approved by the regulator, the vaccine will be a significant boost and another weapon in our arsenal to beat this awful virus. ""I'm proud the UK is at the forefront of another medical breakthrough and I want to thank the brilliant scientists and researchers, as well as the tens of thousands of selfless volunteers who took park in clinical trials. ""The NHS stands ready to roll this vaccine out as quickly as possible if it is authorised."" PM Boris Johnson said it was ""good news"". Meanwhile French firm Valneva has started large-scale manufacturing of its vaccine in Livingston, West Lothian. It can supply up to 250million shots annually. On top of this, US tests on the Janssen vaccine are expected to pave the way for 30million doses to start arriving in the UK as early as July. Janssen is the Belgium-based vaccine arm of US pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson. Through its Vaccines Taskforce, the UK has now secured early access to 367million jabs. There was further good news when Israel announced that less than 0.04 per cent of patients who received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine have developed Covid. But holidays to European hotspots will be off until they sort their shambolic vaccination rollout. Senior cabinet minister Michael Gove has hinted that stricter border measures could be in place for months, even after the UK comes out of lockdown. Yesterday the UAE, a favourite of social media influencers, was added to 30 no-go countries. An estimated 24,000 Brits across the globe now face dashing back to avoid having to quarantine in hotels on arrival, expected to be imposed on February 8. But for the next week, arrivals will have to isolate for ten days at home. Mr Gove said: ""I think it's important to stress that people shouldn't expect any premature lifting of these restrictions."""
396,396,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha Clark,Boris Johnson sinks Nicola Sturgeon’s push for another independence referendum during Scotland trip,"BORIS Johnson holed Nicola Sturgeon's hopes for another independence referendum yesterday while on a visit to Scotland. The PM told the First Minister to focus on fighting the virus together instead of her ""pointless wrangling"" over a second divisive poll. Asked why the people could not have another say, the PM declared ""they had one in 2014"". He said talk of a second vote was ""completely irrelevant"" to normal people's lives. And he vowed ""wild horses won't keep me away"" from Scotland, after criticism of his tour of Glasgow and Edinburgh. Ms Sturgeon insisted it was not ""essential"" travel and SNP MPs also piled in. Visiting a testing site and British Army troops dishing out the vaccine, he said he was ""here in my capacity as PM of the whole country to thank hardworking officials across the whole of Britain"". And he took apart Ms Sturgeon's demands for another vote on independence — just six years after the last one. He said: ""I don't see the advantage of getting lost in pointless constitutional wrangling when we had a referendum not so very long ago. ""I think what people want to see is us bouncing back more strongly together. I think you can see the amazing contribution of Scotland to the national effort."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer backed the visit. Support for a referendum continues to grow, according to polls north of the border. Scots ministers have vowed to publish a plan for a second vote if they win the upcoming May elections. And writing in today's Sun, senior Tory Michael Gove warns Scots the Covid fight would have been hampered if Scotland was independent."
397,397,The Sun,Nick McDermottHarry Cole,Novavax Covid vaccine – 89% effective jab works on new UK and South African strains and Britain has 60m doses ordered,"A NEW Covid vaccine is more than 89 per cent effective and works on the UK and South African strains of the virus, with Britain ordering 60 million doses. US firm Novavax tonight unveiled the jab, which is effective in 89.3 per cent of cases, with approval likely to follow next month. The UK has secured 60 million doses of the vaccine, which will be manufactured in Stockton-on-Tees for use this summer. It means there are now 120 million more UK-made doses on the way. French firm Valneva has started manufacturing 60 million doses of its promising Covid vaccine candidate in Livingston. The Novavax facility, owned by Fujifilm, has capacity to ramp up production to 180 million doses annually with extra shots sent abroad. Following tonight's Novavax announcement, Boris Johnson hailed the ""good news"" and thanked the volunteers. The PM said: ""Our medicines regulator will now assess the vaccine, which will be made in Teesside. If approved, we have 60m doses on order."" The results brought joy to Vaccine Minister Nadhim Zahawi, who was one of 15,000 UK volunteers to take part in the Noravax trials. He said: ""I am particularly thrilled to see such positive results. ""I want to thank the thousands of trial volunteers, without whom these results would not have been possible."" He added: ""It will now be for the regulator to do its crucial work in assessing the efficacy and safety of this vaccine, but if approved it will be a further boost to our vaccination programme."" The Novavax jab was 89.3 per cent effective in preventing Covid in the UK trial. More than a quarter of participants were over-65s, and the pharma firm will now apply for approval. Experts also said the vaccine was 85.6 per cent effective against the new UK variant. If approved it will be a further boost to our vaccination programme Half of the cases in the trail were the new Kent mutant strain. Trials in South Africa, where another variant of the virus has emerged, showed efficacy of just under 50 per cent. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""This is positive news and, if approved by the medicines regulator, the Novavax vaccine will be a significant boost to our vaccination programme and another weapon in our arsenal to beat this awful virus. ""I'm proud the UK is at the forefront of another medical breakthrough and I want to thank the brilliant scientists and researchers, as well as the tens of thousands of selfless volunteers who took park in clinical trials. ""The NHS stands ready to roll this vaccine out as quickly as possible to those most at risk if it is authorised."" Stanley Erck, President and Chief Executive Officer at Novavax said : ""This is the first vaccine to demonstrate not only high clinical efficacy against Covid-19 but also significant clinical efficacy against both the rapidly emerging UK and South Africa variants. ""It has the potential to play an important role in solving this global public health crisis."" Clive Dix, Chair of the UK Vaccine Taskforce, said:  ""These are spectacular results, and we are very pleased to have helped Novavax with the development of this vaccine. ""The efficacy shown against the emerging variants is also extremely encouraging. ""This is an incredible achievement that will ensure we can protect individuals in the UK and the rest of the world from this virus."" The Sun can also reveal efficacy results for the much anticipated one-shot Janssen Covid vaccine are expected imminently. Britain has secured 30 million doses, with supplies expected to arrive as early as July if the trial data is positive. It comes as a factory in Scotland has already started large-scale production of a third new jab. Valneva can supply up to 250 million shots of the jab annually, which uses the inactivated virus to kickstart the body's immune response. Valneva chief executive Thomas Lingelbach said: ""Our team in Scotland have done an amazing job to get manufacturing started so quickly. ""We believe that our vaccine, assuming successful development, can make a major contribution in the UK and beyond."" The Novavax jab uses proteins extracted from the coronavirus spike alongside a booster to trigger the body's immune response. Like the Oxford vaccine, it can be stored in the fridge. The trial involved more than 15,000 Brits recruited through the National Institute of Health Research vaccine registry, launched last summer. Nearly 4,000 people in the study were over the age of 65. Through the Vaccines Taskforce, the UK has secured early access to 367 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines so far. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng added: ""The results from the UK trial of Novavax's vaccine look promising, and I welcome the news that the company is planning to submit its data to the regulators. ""Once our medicines regulator receives the data, it will begin to carry out its crucial, independent work to assess whether the vaccine meets robust standards of safety, effectiveness and quality. ""The UK moved quickly to procure 60 million doses from Novavax and I'm pleased to confirm the bulk of the vaccine will be manufactured on Teesside and delivered during this year, if approved for use."""
398,398,The Sun,Harry Cole,Rishi Sunak defends his job-saving Eat Out to Help Out scheme as data shows no link to increased Covid cases,"RISHI Sunak has launched a full throated defence of his flagship Eat Out to Help Out scheme after data showed no link to rising Covid cases. The incredibly popular £849million scheme launched last August to keep the hospitality industry afloat has come under fire in light of the deadly second wave. More than 160 million punters were given 50 per cent off meals to try to get people back into struggling pubs and restaurants, with the scheme credited for getting 400,000 workers off furlough. Now data published by the Treasury shows areas with the high take up of the scheme also still had the low virus levels between August and October. The figures show places such as Westminster and Scarborough and North Devon had very high take-up of Eat Out to Help Out, but very low subsequent Covid cases. Meanwhile Knowsley, Rochdale, Merthyr Tydfil had far higher Covid rates, but lower levels of use of the scheme. The Treasury said: ""These figures confirm that take-up of Eat Out to Help Out does not correlate with incidence of Covid regionally – and indeed where it does the relationship is negative."" A spokesman said: ""As we have done throughout the pandemic, we have worked with creativity and at pace to support individuals and businesses. ""We designed The Eat Out to Help Out scheme to protect 2 million jobs in hospitality, an industry whose employees are at high risk of long-term unemployment in the event of redundancy. ""It protected jobs across the UK by bringing back 400,000 people from furlough while safely restoring consumer confidence."""
399,399,The Sun,Nick GutteridgeHarry Cole,EU to unveil Covid vaccine export ban that could block millions of Pfizer jabs from reaching Britain after factory raid,"BRUSSELS is set to publicly outline its vaccine export ban plan tomorrow - which could see millions of Pfizer doses blocked from entering Britain within days. Under the move to be finalised on Friday, customs authorities in EU countries will have to notify the Commission EVERY time jabs are being sent to Britain - allowing them to keep an eye on our supplies. The move is a huge ramp up in the ongoing vaccine war of words between Britain and the EU over access to vaccines- as Brussels continues to lag far behind the UK's rollout. An EU official said earlier that they would have the power to block experts, saying: ""There is a possibility in certain circumstances not to allow the export to move forward. ""We want to ensure we have a say about where these vaccines are ending up in a situation where we are now in a shortfall of supply."" They claimed that would only happen in ""rare cases"" where companies are failing to fulfil contract commitments to the EU. Pfizer has announced a shortfall in production at its Belgian plant, where jabs destined for Britain are made. Member States are fighting to take the toughest possible line to get their hands on any extra supplies after facing furious criticism for their slow rollouts. The official said: ""If the batch is refused naturally it would stay in Europe and distribution would happen according to the plan."" For now the new controls only apply to completed vaccines, but eurocrats said they could be widened to cover the ingredients that go into making them too. It came as Brussels today ordered a spot check on AstraZeneca's vaccine factory in Belgium to check it isn't lying about delays to production-  as eurocrats' feud with the drugs giant grows ever more bitter. The EU Commission is sending inspectors from the Belgian medicines agency into the plant amid an increasingly fractious row over Europe's stuttering jabs rollout. Its extraordinary move was confirmed in a statement by the office of Belgium's health minister Frank Vandenbroucke, which said it was ""to make sure that the delivery delay is indeed due to a production problem"". Belgian experts will be joined by colleagues from the Netherlands, Italy, and Spain on the raid and will then draw up a report which is set to be released within ""a few days"". The shock development came as Germany's health ministry today recommended AZ's jab should only be given to under 65s. In a statement it said: ""There are currently insufficient data available to assess the vaccine efficacy from 65 years of age."" The advice from Germany's vaccine committee comes ahead of an expected EU wide decision on the jab tomorrow - to give it the formal green light. During EU Parliament on Tuesday, the EMA boss Emer Cooke said there had been a ""very small quantity of elderly populations"" in AZ's study and it was ""possible to conclude an authorisation that would focus on a particular age group"". But this evening Boris Johnson hit back - claiming the jab was perfectly safe for older people. He said tonight that the Oxford jab ""is a good vaccine and so I'm very confident about it"". He added: ""The evidence that they've supplied is that they think that it is effective across all age groups. It provides them a good immune response across all age groups, so I don't agree with [the German decision]."" Today Downing Street refused to rule out giving UK vaccines to the EU once the most vulnerable in this country have been inoculated. Germany's government is under huge pressure over the bloc's stuttering jabs rollout, with health minister Jens Spahn admitting the country faces at least 10 weeks of vaccine shortages. Brussels' health chief Stella Kyriakides told AZ it must begin sending jabs from its two plants in Oxfordshire and Staffordshire to the continent or risk financial and legal penalties. In an extraordinary outburst, she accused the Anglo-Swedish firm of breaching its contract with the bloc by trying to keep the UK's supply chain separate to that of the rest of Europe. And Brussels upped its demands further yesterday as a top MEP demanded AstraZeneca cuts deliveries to the UK to reroute supplies to Europe. Peter Liese, who belongs to Angela Merkel's CDU party, issued a veiled threat to the company that investors could pull out over the row. He said: ""If the only solution is to have a reduction of the delivery to the UK, and that would bring more vaccine to the EU, that is only fair. ""The reputation of the Pharma industry is already bad. If they behave like this it will be even worse."" He even warned Britain and the EU risk being plunged into a ""trade war"" by the increasingly bitter feud over vaccine supplies. AstraZeneca has angered EU officials who say the pharmaceutical giant has only pledged to deliver a quarter of the 100 million doses it had promised for the first three months of 2021. Brussels insists AstraZeneca must meet the supply shortfall from UK vaccine supplies, meaning the EU is demanding up to 75 million jabs from British factories. During crisis talks last night Ms Kyriakides pushed the firm to fill the continent's shortfall of up to 49 million doses by dipping into British production lines. AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot said that supply chain ""teething issues"" were fixed in the UK ahead of the EU as Britain signed a contract three months earlier than the bloc. But Ms Kyriakides said: ""We reject the logic of first come first served. That may work at the neighbourhood butchers but not in contracts."" Following the showdown, Ms Kyriakides claimed there was a ""lack of clarity"" over AstraZeneca's delivery schedule and demanded a ""clear plan"". Ms Kyriakides said: ""The EU remains united and firm. ""Contractual obligations must be met, vaccines must be delivered to EU citizens."" Following the talks with EU officials, an AstraZeneca spokesman emphasised it was delivering the vaccine to millions of Europeans for no profit. The spokesman told MailOnline: ""We had a constructive and open conversation about the complexities of scaling up production of our vaccine, and the challenges we have encountered. ""We have committed to even closer co-ordination, to jointly chart a path for the delivery of our vaccine over the coming months as we continue our efforts to bring our vaccine to millions of Europeans at no profit during the pandemic."" EU officials have  vowed to trawl through export data to root out any shipments of vaccines the company may have sent to the UK as their row with it grows increasingly bitter. The UK has ordered 367 million doses, enough for 5.5 per person, with a source telling The Times: ""There is plenty of vaccine. It exceeds what the government wants to do."" At a Brussels meeting tonight France and Poland added their voice to calls for EU-wide powers to ban exports of vaccines. Germany has already come out in favour of much tighter controls on shipments of jabs to Britain and other nations. Berlin's health minister Jens Spahn today admitted his country is facing a shortage of vaccines for at least the next 10 weeks. But fellow Member States are opposed to the plan, and one EU diplomat said it ""won't solve the problem."" Britain has forged ahead with its jabs rollout after moving swiftly and tying up a contract with AstraZeneca for the supply of its jabs a whole three months earlier than Brussels. You could not make it up! It's pathetic. They screwed up and are now trying to blame everyone else. But that progress could now be under threat with eurocrats piling pressure on company bosses to ""reject the logic of first come first served"" and start diverting doses their way. Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith told The Sun: ""You could not make it up! It's pathetic. They screwed up and are now trying to blame everyone else. ""This is a really big moment as many will finally see just how arrogant and intolerant so many of the EU institutions really are. ""They just don't get it. They have made a complete mess of vaccinations and having made that mess they are now trying to shift blame on to AZ . ""The blame is wholly theirs. ""This is an astonishing demonstration of mean spiritedness and arrogance, who makes it very clear to those who did not understand before, why we were right to leave the EU."" Tory MP Michael Fabricant said: ""This spat between the EU and AstraZeneca is an undignified attempt by the Brussels bureaucracy to blame anyone but themselves for their shameful performance so far in vaccinating the Europe population. ""This is such an example of highly paid European Commissioners trying to cover their derrieres. Ms Kyriakides said the EU's contract with the firm, for up to 400 million doses, names factories in the UK and not using them to supply the bloc is ""against the letter and the spirit of our agreement"". She fumed: ""In our contract it is not specified that the UK has priority because it signed earlier. There is no such clause."" Asked directly if the EU expects AstraZeneca to shift doses from Britain, she replied: ""The UK factories have to deliver."" An EU official added: ""If UK plants are working better are we expecting UK plants to deliver doses to the EU? Yes we do."" The PM added the AstraZeneca vaccine ""continues to be made in ever-growing quantities in the UK"" and ""that will accelerate"" in future. As the row escalated AstraZeneca immediately hit back, insisting the Commission had been heavily involved in drawing up its plans for deliveries to Europe. A spokesman said: ""As each supply chain has been set up to meet the needs of a specific agreement, the vaccine produced from any supply chain is dedicated to the relevant countries or regions and makes use of local manufacturing wherever possible."" A Government spokesman said they were in contact with the drugs giant and ""we remain confident that supply of vaccine to the UK will not be disrupted"". They added: ""We have deals in place with seven vaccine developers that will ensure our supply continues to grow, as we rapidly expand the rollout in the weeks ahead. ""This pandemic is a global challenge and international collaboration on vaccine development and production continues to be an integral part of our response."" The Commission has faced a barrage of criticism over the bloc's snail-paced delivery of its vaccine programme, with critics openly questioning why the UK has been so much more successful. Britain has jabbed 7.3 million people so far, dishing out an impressive 10.3 doses per 100 people. In contrast the whole EU, which has a population seven times larger, has only vaccinated 9.7 million at a rate of just 2.19."

Rishi Sunak told his new US counterpart Janet Yellen his kids were excited that ""another kickbutt lady"" is in a major job in Joe Biden's government. The gushing praise was part of a charm offensive from London towards the new White House - which also has the US's first female Vice President Kamala Harris. Mr Sunak and Ms. Yellen had their first phone call yesterday where they discussed the dire state of the Covid ravaged global economy. But they managed to break up the gloom by bonding over their shared love of the musical Hamilton. Ms. Yellen was sworn in on Tuesday as the first ever female head of the US Treasury and the UK was top of her call list. One US TV station marked the historic moment with a parody song from the smash hit rap show, featuring the 74 year old economist.

402,402,The Sun,Nick GutteridgeHarry Cole,Boris vows UK vaccine supplies secure after EU bid to snatch Covid vaccines from UK & AstraZeneca hints it won’t give in,"BORIS Johnson vowed Britain's vaccines supplies are secure after the EU's threat to snatch 75 million Covid vaccines from Britain. The PM spoke out after Brussels ordered AstraZeneca to start diverting lifesaving vaccines from British factories to Europe - risking a squeeze on NHS supplies and a major row with No 10. Brussels' health chief Stella Kyriakides told the drugs giant it must begin sending jabs from its two plants in Oxfordshire and Staffordshire to the continent or risk financial and legal penalties. In an extraordinary outburst, she accused the Anglo-Swedish firm of breaching its contract with the bloc by trying to keep the UK's supply chain separate to that of the rest of Europe. But Boris insisted the UK's supply was safe, stressing last night: ""We're very confident in our supplies, we're very confident in our contracts, and we're going ahead on that basis. ""I am pleased at the moment we have the fastest rollout of vaccines in Europe and by some way."" AstraZeneca has angered EU officials who say the pharmaceutical giant has only pledged to deliver a quarter of the 100 million doses it had promised for the first three months of 2021. Brussels insists AstraZeneca must meet the supply shortfall from UK vaccine supplies, meaning the EU is demanding up to 75 million jabs from British factories. During crisis talks last night Ms Kyriakides pushed the firm to fill the continent's shortfall of up to 49 million doses by dipping into British production lines. AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot said that supply chain ""teething issues"" were fixed in the UK ahead of the EU as Britain signed a contracted three months earlier than the bloc. But Ms Kyriakides said: ""We reject the logic of first come first served. That may work at the neighbourhood butchers but not in contracts."" Following the showdown, Ms Kyriakides claimed there was a ""lack of clarity"" over AstraZeneca's delivery schedule and demanded a ""clear plan"". Ms Kyriakides said: ""The EU remains united and firm. ""Contractual obligations must be met, vaccines must be delivered to EU citizens."" Following the talks with EU officials, an AstraZeneca spokesman emphasised it was delivering the vaccine to millions of Europeans for no profit. The spokesman told MailOnline: ""We had a constructive and open conversation about the complexities of scaling up production of our vaccine, and the challenges we have encountered. ""We have committed to even closer co-ordination, to jointly chart a path for the delivery of our vaccine over the coming months as we continue our efforts to bring our vaccine to millions of Europeans at no profit during the pandemic."" EU officials have  vowed to trawl through export data to root out any shipments of vaccines the company may have sent to the UK as their row with it grows increasingly bitter. Meanwhile, industry insiders believe Britain had more than enough vaccines for this year and may be able to donate spare supplies to other countries, it's reported. The UK has ordered 367 million doses, enough for 5.5 per person, with a source telling The Times: ""There is plenty of vaccine. It exceeds what the government wants to do."" At a Brussels meeting tonight France and Poland added their voice to calls for EU-wide powers to ban exports of vaccines. Germany has already come out in favour of much tighter controls on shipments of jabs to Britain and other nations. Berlin's health minister Jens Spahn today admitted his country is facing a shortage of vaccines for at least the next 10 weeks. But fellow Member States are opposed to the plan, and one EU diplomat said it ""won't solve the problem."" Britain has forged ahead with its jabs rollout after moving swiftly and tying up a contract with AstraZeneca for the supply of its jabs a whole three months earlier than Brussels. You could not make it up! It's pathetic. They screwed up and are now trying to blame everyone else. But that progress could now be under threat with eurocrats piling pressure on company bosses to ""reject the logic of first come first served"" and start diverting doses their way. Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith told The Sun: ""You could not make it up! It's pathetic. They screwed up and are now trying to blame everyone else. ""This is a really big moment as many will finally see just how arrogant and intolerant so many of the EU institutions really are. ""They just don't get it. They have made a complete mess of vaccinations and having made that mess they are now trying to shift blame on to AZ . ""The blame is wholly theirs. ""This is an astonishing demonstration of mean spiritedness and arrogance, who makes it very clear to those who did not understand before, why we were right to leave the EU."" Tory MP Michael Fabricant said: ""This spat between the EU and AstraZeneca is an undignified attempt by the Brussels bureaucracy to blame anyone but themselves for their shameful performance so far in vaccinating the Europe population. ""This is such an example of highly paid European Commissioners trying to cover their derrieres. Ms Kyriakides said the EU's contract with the firm, for up to 400 million doses, names factories in the UK and not using them to supply the bloc is ""against the letter and the spirit of our agreement"". She fumed: ""In our contract it is not specified that the UK has priority because it signed earlier. There is no such clause."" Asked directly if the EU expects AstraZeneca to shift doses from Britain, she replied: ""The UK factories have to deliver."" An EU official added: ""If UK plants are working better are we expecting UK plants to deliver doses to the EU? Yes we do."" The PM added the AstraZeneca vaccine ""continues to be made in ever-growing quantities in the UK"" and ""that will accelerate"" in future. As the row escalated AstraZeneca immediately hit back, insisting the Commission had been heavily involved in drawing up its plans for deliveries to Europe. A spokesman said: ""As each supply chain has been set up to meet the needs of a specific agreement, the vaccine produced from any supply chain is dedicated to the relevant countries or regions and makes use of local manufacturing wherever possible."" A Government spokesman said they were in contact with the drugs giant and ""we remain confident that supply of vaccine to the UK will not be disrupted"". They added: ""We have deals in place with seven vaccine developers that will ensure our supply continues to grow, as we rapidly expand the rollout in the weeks ahead. ""This pandemic is a global challenge and international collaboration on vaccine development and production continues to be an integral part of our response."" British officials have been in regular contact with eurocrats about the bloc's latest demands and are closely monitoring the situation. Ms Kyriakides said AstraZeneca's current offer would see it supply just a quarter of the jabs it promised to Brussels in the first quarter of this year. EU officials have warned the company it could face financial penalties or legal action, including the possible termination of its contract for non-compliance. One said: ""We are looking at means to recuperate the money."" They are also pushing for the publication of the contract, arguing an interview with its CEO in which he said the drugs giant only has to make ""best efforts"" to supply the bloc breaches a confidentiality agreement. An angry Ms Kryiakidies insisted AstraZeneca is obliged stick to a delivery schedule, branding its arguments ""neither correct nor acceptable"". Eurocrats have also raised suspicions the firm may have shipped some doses made in Europe and intended for their own stockpile to Britain. A second official said: ""We are looking at the customs data. The customs data does not lie. ""I can see that vaccines were shipped to many country from Europe. You can be assured we will find this information."" The Commission has faced a barrage of criticism over the bloc's snail-paced delivery of its vaccine programme, with critics openly questioning why the UK has been so much more successful. Britain has jabbed 7.3 million people so far, dishing out an impressive 10.3 doses per 100 people. In contrast the whole EU, which has a population seven times larger, has only vaccinated 9.7 million at a rate of just 2.19."

In coverage of the funeral of Eamon ""Peggy"" McCourt, BBC News described the republican gunman as a ""veteran."" Police are probing possible Covid rule breaches at the gathering in Londonderry on Monday. But the BBC's description of the late McCourt as a ""veteran"" - giving equivalence between criminals and troops - sparked uproar. Defence chiefs, MPs and former soldiers raged against the corporation, accusing it of besmirching the 1,400 British soldiers who laid down their lives during The Troubles. Former Defence Minister Lord Lancaster told The Sun the BBC's choice of words was ""bizarre and deeply insulting"". ""It's an accolade to be called a veteran. A tribute to serving your country. It should never be used to champion terrorism."" He blasted giving ""equivalence to terrorists"" and ""thousands of military veterans who have sacrificed so much to deliver security for our nation."" And the Chairman of the Commons Defence Select Committee said it was ""a most dishonourable use of the word"" veteran. Tobias Ellwood, who served in the Royal Green Jackets, added: ""It's an accolade to be called a veteran. A tribute to serving your country."" ""It should never be used to champion terrorism."" Tory MP Sir Desmond Swayne, who has been in the Territorial Army since 1978, said it was ""an insult to all veterans, but nothing surprises me about BBC News coverage."" When approached by The Sun today, the BBC admitted the word should never have been used. A spokesman said: ""We used the term 'IRA veteran' to describe Eamon McCourt's long involvement in Irish republicanism. ""We accept that this shorthand formulation could be misinterpreted and it has now been amended for clarity. ""Mr McCourt is now described as an 'IRA man' in our online news report. Related social media posts have also been updated."" They added: ""We understand the sensitivities around Troubles' issues and legacies, including in relation to terminology. Much of this can be contested. ""No offence was intended and we regret any misunderstanding or upset that may have been caused."""

Two thirds of the public (64 per cent) think the Government should use smart devices to check up on people who are supposed to be self-isolating at home or in a hotel. The poll of over 2000 adults by pollsters JL Partners comes as ministers are set to unveil a new quarantine policy, which will see arrivals into the UK pay to stay in special isolation hotels for ten days. Ministers have also been mulling over systems to encourage people who are self-isolating. Smartphone tracking is used in Poland, which makes users take a selfie at the address where they are supposed to be self-isolating. The NHS app currently uses bluetooth to work out if a user has been near someone who has tested positive for the virus - but has no tracking capabilities. When Brits were asked about introducing similar measures only 17 per cent said they would be against it. Younger people, between the ages of 18 and 24, were the most sceptical, with 26 per cent against the proposals. People are just as supportive of using GPS tracking although 19 per cent are opposed. And older people over the age of 65 are keen to use facial recognition tech to track rule breakers, with 73 per cent in favour of using the technology. James Johnson, former pollster at No10 and co-founder of JL Partners, said: ""With the Government on the brink of announcing quarantine plans, the use of GPS and facial recognition technology to check whether people arriving from abroad are staying at home gets substantial backing from the British public.

406,406,The Sun,Harry ColeJonathan ReillyKate Ferguson,Holidays abroad ‘axed’ as Boris Johnson approves plan to put UK travellers in £1k quarantine hotels,"BRITS were last night preparing to book summer holidays to Bognor as Boris Johnson signs off plans to put all travellers from abroad into ten-day hotel quarantine. Travel experts say the move, which would cost families at least £1,000 extra, will wreck plans for foreign breaks. Brits thinking of booking a fortnight of sunshine were last night warned the restrictions could last months — possibly even a year until the pandemic is beaten worldwide. Experts said families faced forking out at least £1,000 to be ""imprisoned"" in UK hotels once they returned, effectively putting paid to foreign hols. Ministers will meet today to sign off the plans aimed at stopping new mutant strains entering our shores. Boris Johnson said: ""We want to make sure that we protect our population, protect this country, from re-infection from abroad. ""So that idea of looking at hotels is certainly one thing that we're actively looking at. ""We need a solution that gives us the maximum possible protection against reinfection from abroad."" But he offered hope of easing the national lockdown in just three weeks time with some primary schools able to open before February 15. The Sun can reveal key exam years could also be first under ""phased return"" plans. In a major boost for Brits and the pummelled economy, the Mr Johnson said he was looking at the potential of relaxing some measures ahead of the February 15 deadline to vaccinate the most vulnerable — if the death data permits. And kids are top of the list, with parents promised two weeks notice if their children will go back. The Sun understands schools in parts of the country where infection rates are lower may also reopen ahead of those in Covid hotspots. Children's Commissioner for England Anne Longfield commented: ""Ultimately, children need to get back in school as soon as possible — it needs to be safe but it needs to be planned."" The decision to ease the lockdown restrictions, possibly moving some areas into Tier 4, will depend on deaths and hospital admissions reducing. That idea of looking at hotels is certainly one thing that we're actively looking at. In the meantime, the new foreign travel rules are likely to make it impossible for families to plan or book their holidays. Travel experts said they feared the quarantine system could last for a year as it has in Australia. Paul Charles, founder and chief executive of The PC Agency, said: ""There is a real fear within the industry that this could last for a year. It's not just a short-term fix, and like Australia this could go on for some time and cut Britain off from the rest of the world."" Airline shares tumbled after senior ministers appeared to confirm the new restrictions. Gloria Guevara, head of World Travel & Tourism Council begged the government to reconsider. She said: ""We implore the UK government to rethink the introduction of these extreme and sweeping border measures. WTTC is in no doubt they would destroy the UK travel and tourism sector as we know it."" Heathrow bosses said it would be ""effectively the closure of our borders"". But Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""I think it is incredibly important that we are cautious at the border."" Meanwhile, hopes of easing the lockdown were boosted by another day of soaring vaccine numbers. Almost four in five of all over-80s have now had the first dose of their Covid jab. And the total is 6.6 million — one in nine of the population. Mr Hancock confirmed that Britain would head back to a tiered system when Britain finally begins to unlock - as The Sun revealed last week. But he attempted to pour cold water on hopes of a swift exit, telling the Downing Street press conference ""the pressure on the NHS remains huge"" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is being hauled to the Commons today to be grilled by MPs on his roadmap for unlocking schools. There were some glimmers of hope yesterday as the PM said he hoped to ease some of the lockdown restrictions within three weeks. The news comes as infections fell to their lowest daily rate since before Christmas, with 22,195 people testing positive for the virus in 24 hours on Monday. Daily deaths were also down to 592 after multiple days of more than 1,000 fatalities last week. THERE was standing room only as thousands of Brazilians ignored strict a Covid crackdown and flocked to the beach. Crowds swarmed on to Rio de Janeiro's Ipanema Beach at the weekend, even though there are orders in place against mass gatherings. The city's carnival has already been cancelled this year in one of the countries hardest hit by coronavirus — with more than 200,000 deaths. Travel to the UK has already been stopped amid fears of a potentially dangerous Covid variant which was found in Brazil."
407,407,The Sun,Harry Cole,Universal Credit uplift set to be extended while Covid restrictions last and then given to the poorest,"THE £20 Universal Credit boost is likely to stay while Covid rules remain — and then be phased out to target the poorest. The bump expires at the end of March. And PM Boris Johnson has stepped into a growing Cabinet rift to demand a middle way to avoid a cliff-edge. It has been seen as a weekly lifeline to Britain's poorest families, adding an extra £1,040 a year income. Chancellor Rishi Sunak does not want to make the £6billion uplift permanent but is under pressure from MPs and Work and Pensions Secretary Thérèse Coffey to change his mind. He says it will cost the equivalent of a penny on income tax for 30 million Brits, and a 5p rise in fuel duty to fill the black hole in Britain's battered finances. A Government source said: ""It's not a binary choice between extending or not. All options remain on the table and ministers are working through them to find the best solution for families and those on lower incomes."" It is understood Mr Sunak plans to announce at the Budget that the full measure will stay for a long as Covid restrictions are in place, before being phased out to help only the neediest. He has considered easing the withdrawal pain with a one-off cash bonus of £500 but his allies reject reports it could rise to £1,000. One Tory MP said: ""Why favour welfare claimants rather than soldiers, doctors, police, nurses and teachers? If anyone deserves a pandemic bonus, it is them."" Today, Ms Coffey said: ""It's fair to say I'm in active discussion with the Chancellor and the PM about how we continue to make sure we support families during this difficult time."" Jonathan Reynolds, Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, said: ""The Government must now support struggling families and cancel the cut to Universal Credit."""

As ministers prepare to force returning holiday makers into airport hotel isolation, new polling shows the public think it's too little too late. 83% of Conservative and 92% of Labour voters think the Government should have been tougher on international arrivals, according to a survey by Opinium. The ""One Rule For Them"" campaign group who commissioned the poll said: ""When faced with the hard decisions like closing our borders during this crisis Boris Johnson has dithered and delayed."" The PM will convene his Covid ""war committee"" on Tuesday and is expected to tighten border restrictions after Matt Hancock admitted 77 cases of the South African covid variant have been found in the UK. And 11 cases of the Brazilian mutation have also been found, but Mr Hancock insisted there was no evidence of community transmission of either. Instead he blamed international travel and insisted more needed to be done to police UK borders. Letting fly at Covidiot influencers and celebs flouting travel rules, Mr Hancock said no one should be travelling for ""weekends in Paris or parties in Dubai"". And the health secretary hinted 2021 will be a year of staycation, saying we can look forward to a ""great British summer."" Mr Hancock confirmed that Brits face no toughening of domestic lockdown measures currently, but borders will likely be tightened this week."

The PM was warned that a swift return was vital to avoid risking ""a lost generation"" of kids from the country's poorest families. The calls came after Health Secretary Matt Hancock hinted teachers will be vaccinated as a priority — but not before Easter. Tory MPs and parents warned Boris Johnson last night that children risk becoming the ""forgotten victims"" of the Covid pandemic. Former Cabinet Minister Esther McVey said ""We genuinely seem to have forgotten about schoolchildren. ""They are the pandemic's forgotten victims.

Mr Johnson and Education Secretary Gavin Williamson faced a furious backlash after the Health Secretary hinted that schools would not reopen until Easter. Matt Hancock said we have a ""long, long way to go"" before lockdown can be lifted. His comment sparked uproar among senior Tory MPs who are demanding more clarity from ministers. A dozen Conservative MPs have signed up to the ""UsforThem"" campaign to get schools opened up as soon as possible. The powerful boss of the Commons Education Select committee, Robert Halfon, said Mr Johnson must use the full ""engine of government"" to get schools open again after February half term"" — beginning in areas with lower Covid cases. The Essex MP told The Sun: ""Long after the coronavirus has gone, our younger children could be mired in a ditch of educational poverty, mental health crises and safeguarding hazards because of the damage of school closures."" Mansfield MP Ben Bradley said: ""Schools must reopen. Each day they're out of the classroom, the most disadvantaged children are falling behind in their education, and their life chances are poorer as a result."" Mark Harper, head of the Covid Recovery Group of Tory MPs, said: ""As the PM himself said last August, 'keeping our schools closed a moment longer than absolutely necessary is socially intolerable, economically unsustainable and morally indefensible'."" It is feared some kids in areas with high Covid rates won't be able to return to class until spring with Mr Williamson set to rule out any kids returning before February half-term. Mr Hancock yesterday refused to put a date on schools returning. He said teachers have a ""good shout"" of being high on the coronavirus vaccine priority list once the most clinically vulnerable have been jabbed. But health sources said this was unlikely to begin before April. He rejected an offer from private schools and academies to jab all of the UK's teachers at half-term at no cost to the Government, saying the challenge was ""supply of vaccine"". Children's Commissioner Anne Longfield told The Sun: ""The first lockdown caused a huge rise in the number of children with serious mental health issues and widened gaps in learning, particularly for the most disadvantaged. Closing schools is bad for children."" ""The Education Secretary was right to say he hoped to have all children back in the classroom before Easter.

""What worries me most is that the schools shutdown is having a disproportionate impact on society's most vulnerable and disadvantaged children as well, increasing the attainment gap between them and their peers from wealthier areas and families – a gap that is 'widening by the day' according to the Social Mobility Commission. ""Education should not be treated as some sort of optional extra.  It is an essential and critical service just like healthcare and the food provision. ""And for the millions of parents who are trying their best to hold down a job whilst performing the duties of childcare and teacher at the same time, the pressure is simply becoming too much.

The shadow foreign secretary denied she backed a left-wing policy pamphlet - that The Sun can reveal also called for Britain's nuclear subs to be ""reconsidered"". She told the BBC it was ""complete and utter rubbish"" that she had ""applauded"" the loony left wishlist. But she was left red-faced when a recording of a Zoom call emerged where she said: ""One of the things that I found really inspirational about this pamphlet is that I think it's based on the belief that I also share that while we learn from the past we are never bound to it and we have to build a foreign policy fit for this century."" The introduction to Open Labour's policy document 'A Progressive Foreign Policy for New Times' said it was time to ""reconsider"" Trident. It also says Britain should: ""Consider a real shift in the nature of our services from classic armed forces to what one might call human security services which would include the military but would also include police, engineers, aid workers, or health workers and would be gender balanced and ethnically diverse. ""Their central task would be to protect human security and in cases of war to dampen down violence rather than intervene on one side or the other."" Ms Nandy spoke at the report's virtual launch last month, but her praise was slammed by an ex-Labour defence minister Kevan Jones who said it would hinder the party's recovery in the North. The North Durham MP told The Mail on Sunday: 'Our Armed Forces are there to defend us, sometimes in very challenging circumstances. As a party, Labour should be proud of them and defend them – not seek to turn them into some sort of peace corps that ""dampens down"" violence. ""Before we start talking this nonsense, we should remember that many of the recruits come from northern, working-class roots in constituencies that are – or used to be – Labour strongholds."" A spokesman said: ""The Labour Party has a proud history of standing up for our values and defending rights around the world."" But the Tory party chairman Amanda Milling hit back: ""Labour claim they're under new management but Lisa Nandy's car crash week on Churchill and now our armed forces shows it's same old Labour.

The Sun can also reveal they joked about who had pinched their shared ""build back better"" slogan from who and bonded over their mutual love of trains. The PM beat his fellow European leaders to the first call with the new White House chief. The pair, who have never met, spent nearly 40 minutes getting to know each other on Saturday night. Mr Biden, who some have suggested harboured a dislike of Mr Johnson because of Brexit, is understood to have reaffirmed that the UK is ""the US's closest ally"". The PM pointed out that a million Americans work for British firms across the pond, and a million Brits work for US firms UK as the reality of that bond. When Mr Johnson won his massive election victory in 2019, Mr Biden publicly called the PM a ""clone"" of Donald Trump. But Downing Street said yesterday the call was ""warm and friendly"". However on a darker note they both agreed climate change posed an ""existential threat"" to our way of life. And they vowed to put green issues at the top of their shared agenda ahead of the UK hosting the major COP21 climate summit in November that Mr Biden is likely to attend. He is also expected in Britain in the summer for the G7. But No10 left the door open to Mr Johnson jetting to Washington before then to meet the new US President, saying: ""The leaders looked forward to meeting in person as soon as the circumstances allow."""
413,413,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Schools ‘must reopen after half term’ MPs warn Boris Johnson as fears grow kids won’t return to class until MAY,"BORIS Johnson must begin getting kids back into classrooms next month, the powerful Commons education boss warned today. Robert Halfon said the PM must use the full ""engine of Government""  to ""get our schools open again after February half term"" - beginning in areas with lower Covid cases instead of  waiting for a national reopening. The prominent Tory MP's intervention came after Health Secretary Matt Hancock hinted teachers WILL be jabbed as a priority - but that won't happen before Easter. There are fears some children in areas with high Covid rates won't be able to return to class until May as the government looks set to rule out any kids returning before February half-term this week. Raising concerns that kids won't be back before April, Mr Hancock refused to put a date on schools returning today. Despite saying there were ""early signs"" cases are falling, the health secretary said it was ""far far far too soon"" to be able to talk about lifting lockdown. But his comments sparked anger from Mr Halfon who is the Chairman of Parliament's powerful Education Select Committee. He wants schools in lower case areas to be allowed to reopen sooner rather than waiting for a blanket reopening across England. The Essex MP told The Sun today: ""Long after the coronavirus has gone our younger children could be mired in ditch of educational poverty, a mental health crises and safeguarding hazards because of the damage of school closures."" And he demands: ""The engine of Government should be directed to do everything possible to get our schools open again after February half term - as was stated previously by the Prime Minister. ""If there are areas of the country with low Covid rates, there should be no reason not to open the schools."" He added: ""As the Deputy Chief Medical Officer said to our Education committee recently, teachers and support staff are at no greater risk than any other profession, nor is there evidence that schools are significant transmitters of the virus."" The row comes as Mr Hancock rejected an offer from an independent headteachers group to jab half a million teachers over next month's half term. On Sunday morning Mr Hancock said teachers have a ""good shout"" of being high on the coronavirus vaccine priority list once the most clinically vulnerable have received their jabs. But health sources say this is unlikely to begin before April and the list of next wave tobe jabbed is still being decided. Bosses of Britain's leading private schools and academies have offered to vaccinate all of the UK's teachers at half term at no cost to the government. But Mr Hancock hit back: ""It's not a matter of logistics, the logistics can be organised. ""The challenge is the supply of vaccine, supply is the rate-limiting factor. ""The question is who should have each dose as it comes in... and we've taken the decision, quite rightly, to go through in order of clinical need, starting with those who are most likely to die from this disease. ""We're going through those who are clinically vulnerable... and after that there's a perfectly reasonable debate to be had about who should go in what order next."" He  added: ""Teachers have got a good shout to be very high on the list and those discussions are going on."" Six out of ten Brits want teachers to be given top priority to speed up the safe reopening of schools, a Sun on Sunday survey found. Former work and pensions secretary Esther McVey said: ""It's vital schools reopen - for the child's best interest and for families, too. ""If vaccinating teachers, after the most vulnerable in society, removes the barriers to reopening schools then we should do it."""
414,414,The Sun,Nick GutteridgeHarry Cole,Nissan commits to continue making cars in Britain – despite threats over Brexit,"NISSAN is to continue making the Leaf and other cars in Britain despite threats to relocate because of Brexit. It even says the UK's independence gives it a competitive advantage. The Japanese car giant had warned it would pull out of Sunderland but yesterday confirmed the U-turn over its plant there, which employs 6,000. Boris Johnson hailed it a ""great vote of confidence"" after the manufacturer pledged its long-term future to the UK thanks to his Brussels deal. Nissan's chief operating officer Ashwani Gupta said the PM's trade pact with the EU had prevented major disruption and dismissed checks and paperwork at the border as ""peanuts"". His comments marked a radical departure from its previous warnings that leaving the EU threatened its UK operations. He told the BBC: ""The Brexit deal is positive for Nissan. It has created a competitive environment for Sunderland, not just inside the UK but outside as well. ""In certain conditions, our competitiveness is improved."" The firm will also now manufacture its new 62kWh battery in Sunderland for export to the EU. As well as the Leaf electric, it also makes the Juke and Qashqai models at the plant. Production could be nearly doubled to 350,000 cars a year."
415,415,The Sun,Harry Cole,Britain infuriates Brussels by refusing to grant EU officials diplomatic immunity,"BREXIT Britain is refusing to grant hordes of Eurocrats in London diplomatic immunity — to the fury of Brussels. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has turned down elite credentials to the EU's new ambassador to the capital — because he does not represent a country. Livid Brussels bosses want him to be able to roam the UK above the law. But Joao Vale de Almeida, the EU's first ambassador in London after Brexit, has not been given the same favoured status as other diplomats. EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell has written to Mr Raab directly to raise his ""series concerns"" about the situation Downing Street said the EU delegation would receive the ""privileges and immunities"" they needed to carry out their work in the UK. But senior Tory Tobias Ellwood described the row as a ""silly spat"" and insisted the UK should be ""better than this"". Mr Ellwood, chairman of the Commons Defence Committee, said: ""This is simply petty."" BRUSSELS should get its story straight. Either the EU is just a club of nations which never threatened our sovereignty, or it's evolving into one giant country. And since it's insisting — so far in vain — on its ambassador having diplomatic immunity from UK laws, we must conclude that while pretending to be the former it really considers itself the latter. At least we now know. Once it's all made formal, we must grant that request."
416,416,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Boris Johnson says ‘there’s nothing wrong with being woke’ as he hits back at Labour’s Lisa Nandy attacks over Churchill,"LABOUR'S Lisa Nandy was at the centre of a ""woke"" row last night after attacking Boris Johnson for defending Sir Winston Churchill. The Shadow Foreign Secretary compared racist protests in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017 to the PM criticising left-wing hooligans who defaced a statue of Britain's wartime hero. And she accused him trying to start a ""culture war"" like Donald Trump who stirred up the 2017 race riot. Ms Nandy said: ""Two years later we had the prime minister here trying to start a culture war over a statue of Churchill"". In an interview with the Guardian newspaper, Ms Nandy also accused the PM of attacking trans rights in the ""same pattern of behaviour"". But last night Mr Johnson hit back that its always right ""to stick up for your history, your traditions and your values."" Labour boss Sir Keir Starmer is under pressure to distance himself from his key frontbench ally's incendiary comments. A senior Tory source hit out: ""Labour may think it's wrong to stand up to mobs attacking a statue of our great wartime leader, but we do not."" The added: ""The Conservatives will always stand up for our culture, history and traditions."" And later Mr Johnson said: ""There's nothing wrong with being woke."" But he added: ""I put myself in the category of people who believe that it's important to stick up for your history, your traditions and your values, the things you believe in."" LISA Nandy is becoming a liability for Keir Starmer's Labour. First the shadow foreign secretary hints that her leader should somehow become MORE ""woke"" to get elected. Then she tries to equate Boris Johnson's anger over Winston Churchill's statue being vandalised with Trump backing white supremacists. Good luck selling that one to Red Wall voters. It is ironic to see Nandy baselessly accusing the PM of stoking a ""culture war"" when she devotes so much of her energies to sowing partisan division. She must be confident of her majority in Wigan. Voters in other working-class seats read her woke witterings and weep. In the midst of the row, Mr Johnson declined to comment on whether he believed new President Joe Biden was ""woke."" He told Sky News: ""What I know is that he's a firm believer in the transatlantic alliance and that's a great thing. ""And a believer in a lot of the things that we want to achieve together."""
417,417,The Sun,Nick McDermottHarry ColeShaun Wooller,Record 343k Brits vaccinated in a day as tragic Covid death toll rises to 93k,"A RECORD 343,000 jabs in a day have boosted hopes of beating Covid. But there were prayers for 1,820 more people announced to have died yesterday — also a new high. Three cathedrals — Salisbury in Wiltshire, Blackburn in Lancashire and Lichfield, Staffs — were among sites helping to deliver Tuesday's vaccine record, up nearly 20,000 on the previous best. With 4.6million now vaccinated, Boris Johnson says Britain remains on course to protect the 15million most vulnerable within weeks. Speaking at No10 yesterday, the PM said: ""The light will only really begin to dawn as we get those vaccinations up."" He also warned of more fatalities in the ""tough weeks ahead"". Yesterday's death toll took the UK total to 93,290. Mr Johnson added: ""These figures are appalling and, of course, we think of the suffering that each one of those deaths represent to their friends. ""And I have to tell you, there will be more to come, because what we're seeing is the result of the new variant that we saw just before Christmas. ""It spread very quickly, not just in London and South East where it began but now in virtually in all parts of the country."" Giving a glimmer of hope, he said: ""It looks as though the rates of infection in the country overall may now be peaking or flattening, but they're not flattening very fast. He added: ""We must hope that by getting daily infections down — in the way that perhaps has been happening since the lockdown — that will feed through into a reduction in deaths as well."" Mr Johnson again pleaded with people to obey the stay-at-home order, adding: ""It's clear that we must keep a grip on this. ""We must maintain discipline, keep observing the lockdown, protect the NHS, save lives while the vaccines go in."" The vaccination blitz should make a noticeable difference by the spring, the PM said. He added: ""We're going as fast as we can. It's literally a race against time to protect the elderly and vulnerable in what is still a very tough pandemic."" Cinemas, mosques and cricket clubs are the latest to be turned into vaccination centres. By next week, 67 chemists will also be offering the vaccine. Jabs are already available from over 1,000 GP-led services, more than 200 hospitals and 17 mass immunisation centres. Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said: ""It's fantastic to see the programme expand so fast. ""Each week the NHS is making it easier for people to get a jab closer to home, in a place sat at the heart of their community, from the pharmacy to the mosque."" But the grim Covid figures led Britain's top scientist to warn the crisis has left parts of the NHS resembling a ""war zone"". Speaking on Sky News, Sir Patrick Vallance said despite falling infections, Britain remains in a very ""dangerous situation"". He said the pressure on the NHS is ""very, very bad at the moment, and in some cases it looks like a war zone in terms of the things that people are having to deal with"". He added: ""You go for a walk in the park, life looks normal. You go for a walk in a hospital, or work in one, you will see life not looking normal at all."" Sir Patrick said lockdown limits may last well into spring. He warned the jab will not do the short-term ""heavy lifting"" — with social distancing and hand washing key to stopping the spread. But there was now ""light at the end of the tunnel"", with a slow release into summer as more jabs eased pressure on hospitals. Families may still have to wait months to visit care homes, said Sir Patrick, as inside meets were unsafe even after residents have had their two jabs. He suggested sceptics' opposition to lockdown was ""insanity"". He also admitted the Government had erred by not acting sooner to shut down the country when the pandemic first emerged. His comments came as a new survey found cases had not dropped since the start of January and may even have started to rise. The React study by Imperial College London carried out swab tests on 142,900 volunteers between January 6 and 15. It found around one in 63 people in England now have the virus. London was worst-hit with one in 36 residents infected. Worryingly, cases did not drop over the ten-day survey — unlike at the start of previous lockdowns. Scientists think the more contagious mutation may be to blame. Lead researcher Professor Paul Elliott said: ""Infections must be brought down. ""If prevalence continues at the high rate we are seeing then hospitals will stay under immense pressure, and more and more lives will be lost."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said sticking to the lockdown rules will help reduce the spread. He added: ""These findings show why we must not let down our guard over the weeks to come. ""Infections across England are at very high levels and this will keep having a knock-on effect on the already significant pressures faced by our NHS and hospitals. ""It is absolutely paramount that everyone plays their part. ""This means staying at home and only going out where absolutely necessary, reducing contact with others and maintaining social distancing."" THE huge number of jabs done yesterday should calm nerves among those twitchy about the slowing of the rollout this week. To carry out 343,000 in a day is a great achievement. But the Government must keep that pace going. Because while it is heartening too to see positive cases fall by almost a fifth in a week, that's where the good news ends. Those infections are still colossal. Daily deaths, three weeks on from the catastrophic case peaks around the New Year, have hit an appalling new high. They are near-certain to get worse. The jabs programme simply must not stall."

Taking aim at the departed Donald Trump, Mr Johnson said it had been ""a bumpy period and for us and America."" After watching Mr Biden being sworn in on TV from his office at 10 Downing Street, the PM said ""it's a big moment, we've got things we want to do together."" He pointed to tackling climate change and added: ""we've got to bounce back from Covid together, working together to unite the world in how you tackle a pandemic."" Mr Johnson's gushing praise came after he told his Cabinet that Brexit Britain will be Mr Biden's go to trouble-shooter in the West. The PM has pitched the UK as ""a strong steward of the international system and a pragmatic and problem-solving partner on the world stage"". Yesterday the Queen joined Mr Johnson in welcoming the hand over of power in Washington, as Mr Johnson welcoming strong US leadership in another swipe at outgoing President Trump. The PM said there is now a ""fantastic joint united agenda"" between the UK and US governments and the pair share a favourite slogan: ""build back better"". President Biden is due to visit the UK twice in 2021 for major summits in a boost for Mr Johnson's hopes for a close working relationship. Downing Street insiders say the UK hosting the G7 this summer and a major UN climate summit COP26 means virtual meetings with the new administration will begin almost immediately. Mr Johnson also hopes to work with closely with President Biden on China, Iran and the wider Middle East where he was at odds with President Trump. Risking accusations of neediness, yesterday ministers queued up to heap praise on the new White House boss. Home Secretary Priti Patel declared its time to ""move on'' from the Trump era, while Trade Secretary Liz Truss rushed to reopen deal talks with the new US team. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab gushed: ""From climate change to trade and security, our two countries share a close bond and special relationship. We look forward to working with you on shared priorities as a force for good in the world."" Labour's Sir Keir Starmer also heaped glowing praise on the new President, saying: ""The US begins a new chapter in its history, one of hope, decency, compassion and strength. ""Together, our two nations can build a better, more optimistic future for our world"", he added."

""But I must stress that we have tough weeks to come now as we roll out the vaccine – the light will only really begin to dawn as we get those vaccinations up."" The third-highest daily death toll was reported on January 13, when 1,564 people, who tested positive within 28 days, lost their lives to the virus. Yesterday's figures were less than last Tuesday when 45,533 new infections were recorded alongside 1,243 deaths. Today in Scotland there were 92 deaths with 1,656 new infections. While in Wales there were 1,283 new cases with 44 confirmed deaths. NHS England reported a further 1,027 Covid-19 hospital deaths occurring over 14 dates. 1,012 were reported last Wednesday, 674 two weeks ago and 494 three weeks ago. It comes as... It was announced today that hospitals could be forced to ration oxygen in the near future as Covid inpatients reach record highs. Almost 38,000 Covid patients are in hospitals now, 79 per cent higher than the spring, and 3,900 are on life-supporting ventilators. As pressure builds on the NHS, Dr David Strain said it's ""too late for solutions"", meaning doctors may have to make ""tough decisions"" on how to use oxygen. It would be the first time the health service faced such a moral dilemma, which could leave doctors carrying guilt for years. Dr Strain, a clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter and hospital doctor, told The Sun: ""At some point in the not too distant future we may reach a point when it is not possible to pump enough oxygen through the hospital pipes to supply everyone who can potentially benefit from it."" Meanwhile, experts have warned that the coronavirus deaths will only get worse in the coming days despite a fall in cases and the vaccine rollout. Officials have now warned that further ""record breaking days"" could be on the cards due to the lag between people becoming infected and people being admitted to hospital. Data from Public Health England (PHE) shows that across the country 96 per cent of local authorities have seen a drop in infection rates, with just four per cent seeing a rise. Experts say the lockdown measures alongside the vaccine rollout are starting to take effect but that deaths won't drop until the end of the month. A total of 4,419,704 Covid-19 vaccinations had taken place in England between December 8 and January 19, according to provisional NHS England data, including first and second doses, which is a rise of 301,362 on Tuesday's figures. Of this number, 3,985,579 were the first dose of the vaccine, a rise of 298,3730 on Tuesday's figures, while 434,125 were the second dose, an increase of 2,989. The Pfizer/BioNTech jab and the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab continue to be given to Brits at mass vaccine centres and pharmacies up and down the country. But the most up to date figures show that the number of people getting the jab has dropped off in recent days. On Friday more than 324,000 people got the jab, compared to on Monday when 204,000 received them."
420,420,The Sun,Jonathan ReillyHarry Cole,"Thousands of lives could have been saved if UK shut its borders earlier, Priti Patel admits in leaked tape","THOUSANDS of lives could have been saved if Britain shut its borders earlier the Home Secretary confessed in a bombshell leaked tape. Priti Patel lifted the lid in an explosive row with Boris Johnson after admitting she tried to lockdown the borders back in March. In a secretly recorded address leaked to Guido Fawkes to party faithful on Tuesday night, Patel hit out ""should we have closed our borders earlier, the answer is yes, I was an advocate of closing them last March."" Though risking the wrath of No10, other Cabinet colleagues leapt to Ms Patel's defence. One senior Cabinet Minister told the Sun: ""She was right."" Back in March, the deadly bug was sweeping through France, Spain and Italy but there were zero restrictions on travel or at the border. It's now estimated 10,000 infected people arrived in the UK during the early spring. At Prime Minister Questions this afternoon Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer pressed Boris Johnson over the comments and asked why he over-ruled her. The PM said: ""I think it was last March that Sir Keir along with many others was actually saying that we didn't need to close borders but, as usual, Captain Hindsight has changed his tune to suit events."" Speaking about border now he added: ""That is why we instituted one of the toughest border regimes in the world, that's why we insist you have to get a test 72 hours before you fly, there must be a passenger locator form that you have to provide and you must quarantine for 10 days or five days if you do a second test."" The PM's Spokesman said he had full confidence in the Home Secretary despite her breaking cabinet rules. Asked why the PM ""ignored"" her he said: ""I am not going to get into the detail of private conversations."" On the border measures he added: ""Throughout the pandemic. We've continued to keep all our decisions and all our restrictions under continuous review, and we haven't hesitated to take action based on the latest scientific evidence."" Tory Chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee Tom Tugendhat backed Ms Patel saying that ""with hindsight, we should have closed the borders last March."" He added: ""I think the government's been making some very difficult decisions to try and keep an economy open that can pay for the healthcare we all need, at the same time as protecting as many people as possible and protecting lives."" However Nick Thomas-Symonds MP, Labour's Shadow Home Secretary said it was a ""shocking admission."" He said: ""Priti Patel's admission, coupled with the complete lack of strategy for testing of travellers, means that the Government has left our doors open to the virus and worrying mutations. ""Ministers now need to - urgently - review and overhaul border policy, whilst taking responsibility for the huge damage their incompetence has done to our national safety and security."" And top Government scientist Sir Patrick Vallance, the Government's chief scientific adviser, later admitted the Government ""got some things wrong"" during the early phases of the pandemic. He said border measures should have been imposed sooner, and added: ""The lesson is: go earlier than you think you want to, go a bit harder than you think you want to, and go a bit broader than you think you want to, in terms of applying the restrictions."" He added: You've got to go hard, early and broader if you're going to get on top of this. Waiting and watching simply doesn't work."""
421,421,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Mosques and temples to become jab hubs to tackle spread of vaccine fake news,"MOSQUES and temples will be used to jab worried Brits in a drive to stamp out ""tragic"" religious conspiracy theories about the vaccine. Priti Patel has launched a major drive to tackle fake news claiming the vaccine is unsafe from spreading in ethnic minority communities. The Home Secretary said today: ""We will see temples, gurdwaras, mosques, community centres as well being at the heart of the vaccine rollout programme."" It comes as Sir Patrick Vallance called the low uptake of the jab in BAME communities a ""tragedy"" after conspiracy theorists spewed dangerous messages online. South Asian families are among those being targeted with untrue claims the vaccine contains meat or alcohol, banned in some religions. Figures suggest black and ethnic minority Brits may be staying away from vaccination centres as a result of misinformation. The government's chief scientist hinted that people of colour could be prioritised in the next jab wave. He told Sky News today the pandemic has caused a ""tragedy relating to inequality and black minority ethnic groups"". And Ms Patel revealed she is speaking directly to faith leaders to counter the problem and wants to see jab hubs set up at holy sites. She told Times Radio: ""The government can work with different communities, different ethnic groups as well, to really get into the communities to religious leaders, and many other community leaders to absolutely give the reassurance that's required. ""I hope in the weeks ahead, we will see temples, gurdwaras, mosques, community centres as well being at the heart of the vaccine rollout programme."" She added: ""I know in Bradford there is a gurdwara, that it's been used for the vaccine site. There'll be mosques that will come on stream. ""I know in Neasden there's a school that is linked to the temple that is becoming a vaccine site and the Neasden temple also put out some messages on YouTube over the weekend, telling people that the vaccine is safe."" A Sage study this month revealed nearly three-quarters of black Brits (71.8 per cent) were unlikely or very unlikely to get the jab. However black and ethnic minorities are up to twice as likely to die from Covid as white people. The Sage study revealed 42.3 per cent of Pakistani and Bangladeshi Brits were unlikely to get the jab, while 84.8 per cent of white Brits said they wanted to be vaccinated. Writing in today's Sun, Ms Patel said: ""False information about the vaccine is putting lives at risk. I praise The Sun for bringing this issue to the fore.

422,422,The Sun,Harry ColeKate Ferguson,Boris Johnson launches top secret plan to ease UK lockdown at Easter so Brits can meet loved ones,"BORIS Johnson has begun top secret planning for millions to meet loved ones this Easter - but cracked the whip amid lagging vaccine numbers. The Sun has learnt Cabinet Office civil servants have begun building a detailed ""unlocking framework"" to gradually ease Covid restrictions area by area. Although publicly ministers say it's too soon to say when freedoms can be restored, the PM has tasked No10 officials with building the plans with his eye on early April - even if for many it's only mingling outside. Amid mounting backbench pressure to set out a route out of lockdown, a senior Government source told The Sun: ""It's way too soon to start talking about when, but the work is being done quietly on the how."" But those freedoms are dependent on the vaccine rollout working and declining hospitalisation numbers. Ministers believe the peak of the second wave has now passed, but a two week lag on people needing treatment means the NHS is still under immense stress. Yesterday Mr Johnson ordered the boss of the NHS to speed up vaccinations to end the postcode lottery for the over-80s. Some in their 90s are still waiting for the vaccine in the South and East of England while nearly all 80-year-olds have been jabbed in parts of the North. During a Cabinet presentation by Sir Simon Stevens on Tuesday morning, the PM urged the NHS England boss to ""drive for the line"" to close those gaps. The PM's plea came amid alarming figures showing the number of daily vaccinations slumped by nearly half over the weekend. Medics in England carried out 170,900 jabs yesterday. That is well below the 324,711 vaccinations dished out last Friday - the highest daily figure recorded so far. And it is significantly lower than the number of jabs carried out last Wednesday and Thursday, which were around 250,000 and 275,000 respectively. Just 155,848 vaccines were administered on Sunday - way down on the 277,209 carried out on Saturday. That suggest there could be a 'weekend effect' - with figures dipping on a Sunday. But the numbers will fuel worries that after a lightning quick start, the jabs programme is hitting major supply problems. Ministers have repeatedly said that ""limitations in supply"" is the only reason the country isn't going quicker. Mr Johnson has vowed to continue to ramp up the vaccination programme to hit his target of jabbing 13.5m Brits by mid February. And he has warned that the lockdown can only be lifted once the life-saving jab has gone into enough arms. On Monday he said that there would be ""gradual unwrapping"" of restrictions with officials looking at a phased return to normality starting with schools opening. It is understood current thinking would see kids go back to the classrooms but other stay at home restrictions kept in place - similar to November's shutdown. Mr Johnson is adamant to keep his tier system but it's likely that most of the country would automatically go back into Tier 4 - the highest level of restrictions with pubs and shops still shut - to begin with. Slowly areas may be allowed back into Tiers 3 and 2 that allow more activities and households to meet up outside, with no single ""big bang moment"" of unlocking. Households are able to meet up outside in Tier 2 giving hope for Easter get togethers. Yesterday top medic Jenny Harries confirmed the regional approach would return. Giving evidence to the Commons Education Committee, she said: ""It is highly likely that when we come out of this national lockdown we will not have consistent patterns of infection in our communities across the country. ""And therefore, as we had prior to the national lockdown, it may well be possible that we need to have some differential application."" She added: ""I think it's likely that we will have some sort of regional separation of interventions."" Yesterday leading Tory backbencher Mark Harper urged the PM to speed up the unlocking process, and set out a clear roadmap back from normality. Some Tory MPs want that process to begin at the beginning of March. Mr Harper told The Sun: ""Once the top four risk groups have been vaccinated and fully protected by 8 March - assuming the Government hits the 15 February deadline - the Government must start easing the restrictions. ""Ministers must come forward now with a plan for lifting restrictions. People must see light at the end of the tunnel and feel hope for the future, and businesses need to be able to plan our recovery as more and more of the vaccinations are rolled out to the most vulnerable groups."""
423,423,The Sun,Harry ColeAlex Winter,Army medics scrambled to help heaving intensive care units & Covid wards in London after surge in hospital admissions,"ARMY doctors are manning heaving intensive care units in London today, The Sun can reveal. As the NHS struggles with wave after wave of Covid cases, medically-trained troops have stepped in at St George's Hospital in Tooting, while servicewomen in fatigues were pictured at the Royal Free in Hampstead. On Monday, 40 British Army medical technicians arrived at St George's, with a further 30 more due to start today in non-clinical support roles. Hospital staff were told last night: ""Once their induction has been completed, all 70 army personnel will be allocated roles across the Trust, including on ITU and on our wards."" They were warned: ""Infection rates in the community are going down, but we still expect Covid-19 admissions to put significant pressure on our general and acute beds, plus ITU, for a number of weeks yet."" St George's Trust yesterday had 75 Covid patients in intensive care and nearly 300 on other wards. The Army medics are part of a wave of more than 200 personnel deployed by the Department of Health and the Ministry of Defence to relieve pressure on struggling hospitals across the south-east. The servicemen and women will assist ICU staff battling Covid-19 at main NHS trusts. A further 150 military staff will help in non-clinical roles in order to allow doctors and nurses to care for patients, after the NHS sent a request to the Ministry of Defence for aid. A leaked email claims soldiers will help liaise between patient families and staff, as well as helping with ward activities such as moving patients and equipment around hospitals. Some 10,000 Londoners are testing positive for Covid every day. The capital has been at the epicentre of the pandemic's second wave - and officials say the super-infectious mutant strain will stop cases falling as quickly as they did after the first wave. And while academics say the crucial R-rate may be as low as 0.6 in the city, the number of people catching the deadly virus is still ""extremely high"". However, there's hope the city may have turned the tide - as cases fall in every borough. Despite that, some 8,000 people are currently in hospitals across London with Covid. Dr Rupert Pearse, from the Intensive Care Society, told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme: ""It looks as though infections have peaked in London, but are still on the rise in the north-west of England and around Yorkshire, so there is still cause to be concerned. ""Hospital admissions tend to lag seven to 10 days behind the peak in infections and intensive care medicine unit admissions maybe 48 hours after those, so those hospitals that are very close to the maximum number of hospital beds that they can allocate for Covid are still very worried about what will happen in the coming days."" And another health chief says medics are approaching burn-out. The list reads: Place, cases per 100,000 in the week to January 13, cases per 100,000 in the week to January 6, and the percentage drop Alison Pittard, dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, said many intensive care units are ""already overwhelmed"". She told Sky News this morning: ""There are many intensive care units and hospitals around the country that are already overwhelmed - seeing unprecedented numbers of cases, large numbers of very, very sick people, many of whom are dying. ""And there are staff who are almost on their knees, having been going through this non-stop for months and months and months."" She added: ""We're nowhere near out of this at the moment"", and said intensive care units are expecting further increases in patients. Professor Kevin Fenton of Public Health England warned last week: ""Case rates in London remain extremely high and around 10,000 Londoners were diagnosed with Covid every day this week. ""This level of transmission is severe, and continues to drive pressure on the NHS, with more Londoners being admitted to ICU and ultimately dying of this disease or having long-term complications. ""As a result, we have more difficult weeks ahead of us."" Officials believe the second wave peaked in the capital on January 4 - the start of the national lockdown - when 1,117.1 new cases were recorded per 100,000 Londoners. There are claims London's medics are being forced to choose who gets critical care. Doctors are reportedly triaging patients for critical care, with younger patients in the queue ahead of older people admitted."
424,424,The Sun,Natasha ClarkHarry Cole,Rishi Sunak warns fuel duty hike of 5p per litre will be needed to pay for Universal Credit boost extension,"RISHI Sunak has privately warned he would be forced to hike fuel duty by five pence per litre to pay for extending the Universal Credit uplift post lockdown. PM Boris Johnson is under huge pressure to make the pandemic £20-a-week benefit boost permanent for six million families — having spent £300billion getting the country through the crisis. But the Chancellor has told Tory MPs ""drastic measures"" will be needed to foot the £6billion Universal Credit bill — worth £1,040 to each claiming household. He warned colleagues that sum is the same as putting Income Tax up by one per cent for 30million taxpayers — as well as the dramatic hike in fuel duty. While the PM has vowed not to increase income taxes, Mr Sunak has often hinted a rise is on the cards at March's planned Budget. The hated levy has been frozen at 58p per litre for the last ten years thanks to campaigning by The Sun. A 5p hike would spark uproar on Tory benches, and would trigger a big rebellion. But despite that, allies of the Chancellor are adamant MPs must understand the cost of extending. A senior Tory told The Sun: ""We have spent nearly £300billion so far in this pandemic to help support families through this crisis. ""As a former Conservative PM once said, there is no magic money tree."" The threat came as Mr Johnson suffered a small Tory rebellion last night as six of his MPs defied his orders to abstain on a Labour motion to back extending the uplift. Mr Johnson called the non-binding vote a ""stunt"" and declined to take part, but former Department for Work and Pensions boss Stephen Crabb and Education Select Committee chairman Robert Halfon voted with the opposition. Mr Halfon said yesterday: ""I absolutely believe that Universal Credit should be extended. ""It was pared away in the austerity years, and the £20 restores some balance."" And Mr Crabb said: ""Just withdrawing that £20 a week at the end of March, which is so vital, isn't the right thing to do."" And in a major headache for No 10, the 65-strong Northern Research Group of Red Wall Tory MPs demanded the cash help remain until lockdown ends. The PM dodged questions on whether the uplift would continue three times yesterday. On a visit to Oxford, he would only say: ""We are very proud of Universal Credit. ""We want to support people throughout the pandemic. What we don't want to do is abolish Universal Credit altogether."" Last night No 10 insisted that no decision had yet been made. Sources added that Mr Sunak had ""made his concerns very clear"" to the PM about the cost. The Sun understands a decision will likely be made in the run-up to the March Budget."
425,425,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Millions of pounds of taxpayers’ cash feared stolen in ‘corrupt’ British Virgin Islands,"MILLIONS of pounds of taxpayers cash may have been stolen in a ""rampantly"" corrupt British territory, the Foreign Office fears. The Governor of the British Virgin Islands has sent for a judge from London to investigate allegations of systematic criminality of the tiny West Indies paradise The islands were devastated by Hurricane Irma in 2017 and there have been long standing suspicions that British taxpayer funded help has gone into the pockets of local public officials and their associates. The UK gave more than £50 million in support to the  BVI and neighbouring Anguilla in the wake of the hurricane. And those same fears have been raised over an extra £30 million of local cash earmarked to help fight Covid. Whitehall insiders say there have been ""very serious and troubling allegations of corruption, intimidation and other criminal activity."" This includes ""endemic corruption, rampant cronyism, diversion of public funds into the pockets of political allies – including emergency funds to help the COVID-19 response – bullying, harassment, intimidation and coercion."" One source said that there is a risk that the ""once safe and prosperous"" BVI ""will become nothing less than a byword for corruption and cronyism if decisive action is not taken."" Now a top judge will spend six months on the islands running an independent inquiry into corruption on the island in a very rare intervention. Sir Gary Hickinbottom will have powers to summon any islander and demand its government hand over crucial documentation. Ministers have been under mounting pressure to tackle corruption in the troubled region that is central to the South American drug trafficking trade into the United States. Last December nearly two and a half tonnes of cocaine were seized from a serving cop's house in the BVI. The £189million stash is the equivalent to three quarters of the entire national budget of the territory. But sources say that haul may be ""just tip of the iceberg"" when it comes to corruption in the the BVI. It is understood the allegations include misuse of over £85 million of support for infrastructure and transport - including some £5million spent on BVI Airways which does not exist, and nearly a £1m spent building a school wall. £25 million spent on a cruise ship dock and £45 million on hospital have also raised suspicions. There are also concerns that Covid contracts have been given to public officials' own companies, and even spent on luxury rentals. Attempts to silence the media and critics will also be investigated by the judge. Despite running on a transparency platform in 2019, the Island's current Premier Andrew Fahie has yet to improve governance and delayed promised reforms for ministers and the criminal justice system. Instead hurricane relief funds have been brought under the direct control of ministers, deepening suspicions. Today Governor Gus Jaspert said the probe ""will look into whether corruption, abuse of office or other serious dishonesty in relation to officials - elected, statutory or public - may have taken place in recent years. ""This will be an entirely independent process led by a senior impartial judge coming from outside of the Territory And he added: ""I hope that the Premier, Ministers and all Elected Members can and will fully support this opportunity."""
426,426,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson faces the wrath of Scottish fishermen hit by Brexit delays at ports,"BORIS Johnson is facing the wrath of Scottish fishermen as Brexit border pressure starts to bite. Scots fishermen say new bureaucracy makes exporting to Europe all but impossible for fresh seafood, leaving shellfish rotting at Dover. Yesterday Downing Street promised £100 million in compensation to those businesses blighted by the changing rules ""by no fault of their own"". The row was worsened after fishing minister Victoria Prentis admitted she has not read Mr Johnson's EU deal causing the changes. The bungling Tory claimed to have been ""very busy on Christmas Eve"" when the agreement came through, ""organising the local nativity trail"". Yesterday Environment Secretary George Eustice insisted to MPs the issue can be quickly resolved. He told the Commons: ""They are only teething problems, once people get used to using the paperwork goods will flow normally."" But Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross said financial compensation is ""clearly needed by our fishermen right across the country"". During an urgent question on the matter in the Commons on Thursday, MPs from all parties voiced their concerns about exports of Scottish seafood from smaller companies being halted for a further five days by transport company DFDS. DFDS stopped exports last week after delays in getting new paperwork introduced following the expiry of the Brexit transition period for EU border posts in France. Paperwork has to be approved before consignments can be sent to DFDS's warehouse in South Lanarkshire and then on to English Channel ports. Liberal Democrat MP Alistair Carmichael described the situation as ""a shambles of the Government's own making""."
427,427,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson given bombshell warning to lift lockdown soon or face leadership threat – from MP who ousted Theresa May,"BORIS Johnson's days in Downing Street are numbered unless he gives a clear path out of lockdown soon, influential Tories have warned. Powerful backbencher Steve Baker, who was instrumental in the downfall of Theresa May, has privately said ""it's inevitable the Prime Minister's leadership will be on the table."" In an explosive rallying call to fellow members of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group, the ex-minister blasted: ""people are telling me they are losing faith in our Conservative Party leadership."" The group represents dozens of Tory backbenchers who are worried about the side effects of long lockdowns. Mr Baker urged those colleagues to make their concerns directly to Mr Johnson's Commons enforcer, Chief Whip Mark Spencer. In a bombshell note to MPs seen by The Sun, Mr Baker writes: ""I am sorry to have to say this again and as bluntly as this: it is imperative you equip the Chief Whip today with your opinion that debate will become about the PM's leadership if the Government does not set out a clear plan for when our full freedoms will be restored."" He told them to demand ""a guarantee that this strategy will not be used again next winter."" The major intervention reads: ""Government has adopted a strategy devoid of any commitment to liberty without any clarification about when our most basic freedoms will be restored and with no guarantee that they will never be taken away again."" It comes as: It continues: ""People are telling me they are losing faith in our Conservative Party leadership because they are not standing up for our values as a party."" ""If we continue forward with a strategy that hammers freedom, hammers the private sector, hammers small business owners and hammers the poor, inevitably the Prime Minister's leadership will be on the table. ""We strongly do not want that after all we have been through as a country."" But he later confirmed his support for the PM in a tweet, saying: ""What this country needs is the complete success of @BorisJohnson, with his excellent EU deal, a successful vaccination programme and a #Road2Recovery back to freedom. ""I am clear Boris is the only person to lead us out of these difficulties and I support him in that endeavour."" What this country needs is the complete success of @BorisJohnson, with his excellent EU deal, a successful vaccination programme and a #Road2Recovery back to freedom. I am clear Boris is the only person to lead us out of these difficulties and I support him in that endeavour. Mr Baker broke cover after government scientist Jonathan Van Tam told this newspaper yesterday that lockdown measures could be enforce until late spring. And today controversial scientist Neil Ferguson said we could still be facing restrictions in the autumn. Mr Baker raged: ""Certain Government scientists have said that the current lockdown could last until late spring. There is no reason to think there will be any real resistance in Cabinet to the argument for greater and longer and more draconian restrictions on the public. ""This could be a disaster. Nothing seems more certain to break the public than giving hope before taking it away, and doing it repeatedly."" And he signs off with a barely concealed warning shot: ""I am sorry to be blunt but if we do not act now, events will become inevitable. For the good of the country please contact the Chief Whip."" Downing Street have been approached for comment. Deputy Leader of the Labour Party Angela Rayner said: ""The day after our country recorded the highest daily death toll since this crisis started, the Conservatives are playing politics and fighting amongst themselves."""
428,428,The Sun,Sascha O'SullivanHarry Cole,Britain could be vaccinating 3 MILLION people a week by February if rollout ramp up goes smoothly,"BRITAIN could be vaccinating 3 MILLION people a week by February if the rollout ramp up goes smoothly. Boris Johnson last night vowed to make vaccines available 24/7 in a push to get another 10 million people vaccinated by mid-February. Three million vaccines have now been given out, fresh figures revealed today. A Government source told The Sun: ""We're in a good place and have enough to meet out pledge, with supply continuously improving. ""We are already vaccinating more than 200,000 a day and are nowhere near capacity. ""If things go smoothly we could well be doing 400,000 a day — three million a week — by the start of February."" The Times claimed it could even reach 500,000 a day next week - more than doubling the current capacity. The PM hinted yesterday that batches of vaccine that had been earmarked to be given out later this year may be brought forward and replaced when others get approval. And the Vaccine Minister also said more than two million Brits a week will be getting the jab by the end of the month. Around 3 million doses of the vaccine have already been given. Nadhim Zahawi told the Science and Technology Committee that initial supplies of the vaccine had been ""lumpy"" but he now had a ""line of sight"" of deliveries to the end of February. He rejected suggestions that ""we are sitting on lots of stock"". AstraZeneca which developed a jab with the University of Oxford, said the UK has 1.1 million doses for use. And the pharmaceutical giant said there will be a supply of two millions doses every week by the middle of February, and possibly even more by April. Tom Keith-Roach, president of AstraZeneca UK, told MPs: ""We are scaling up very rapidly, and this will happen imminently, to releasing two million doses a week. ""We're absolutely on track to do that and therefore deliver tens of millions of doses in the first quarter of the year. ""If we average two million a week through the course of the year, that gets us to the 100 million doses that we're committed to the UK through 2021."" Both the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine and the Pfizer jab are being rolled out across the UK. Mr Johnson revealed yesterday some areas of the Britain had already vaccinated more than 50 per cent of all over 80 year olds. The PM said the vaccination process was already going ""exceptionally fast"" but ""at the moment the limit is on supply"". He told the Commons: ""We have a huge network — 233 hospitals, 1,000 GP surgeries, 200 pharmacies and 50 mass vaccination centres."" By Boris Johnson ON Monday, we published our plan to vaccinate as many people, as quickly as possible, across the UK. This is a huge logistical challenge but we are already making strong progress. More than two million people in England have been vaccinated so far, including more than a quarter of care home residents and a third of over-80s. More than 1,000 vaccination sites are open across the country and we will soon be protecting hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people every single day. We're on track to offer 15million of the most vulnerable people the jab by mid-February and then to all adults over 50 by spring. But this will be the biggest vaccination campaign in NHS history — and a monumental national effort such as this requires each one of us to do what we can to help. The Sun's Jabs Army campaign is a brilliant example of the power of collective action. It has already inspired companies and workplaces up and down the country to join the call to arms. So today, I call on everyone who has the time to join the legions of volunteers already signed up and to boost volunteer numbers further still. That includes public sector workers of all stripes who have kept essential services running during the pandemic and the dedicated and hard-working civil servants serving the public every day. There are deeply challenging weeks ahead. Covid cases are putting huge pressure on the health service. We are once again demanding everyone stay at home in order to stop its spread and protect our NHS. But every day, vaccines move a step further ahead in their race with the virus; a further step towards protecting the public, and defeating Covid. Volunteers will accelerate our vaccination programme. So sign up if you can and help the country return to normal life again. He promised there is a ""big, big stream"" of vaccines coming, and vowed to set up 24/7 vaccine centres ""as soon as we can"". The pledge came as the NHS started to set up pilot schemes where healthcare workers on night shifts can get the jab. Pharmacies have also started rolling out the vaccine, with high street chemists Boots and Superdrug starting today, and 70 more chemists from next week. Supermarkets are also joining in, with Asda becoming the first major retailer to start offering the jabs later this month. The NHS also plans to massively expand the number of pharmacies taking part, following widespread criticism. People could also get jabs at gyms under plans about to be signed off by NHS England."
429,429,The Sun,Harry ColeSascha O'Sullivan,New advertising blitz to warn Brits ‘having a coffee could cost a life’ in fresh crackdown on socialising,"Brits will be warned going for a coffee ""could cost lives"" in a new advertising blitz, The Sun has learnt. Priti Patel ruled out any new lockdown measures ""today or tomorrow"" but instead bending current rules will be heavily targeted. Adverts designed to shock will be unveiled within days in a marked escalation in the campaign to make people stay at home to fight Covid. Sources say one slogan being considered is: ""DON'T LET A COFFEE COST A LIFE"". Another planned poster will say ""COVID TAKES THE TRAIN TOO"". One new poster was revealed today, saying: ""catch-ups cost lives... don't bend the rules."" Meeting others unnecessarily could be the link in a chain of transmission that has a vulnerable person at the end. Please, stay at home this weekend. pic. twitter. com/c6YmFeccdX The shocking adverts have been prepared by an external advertising agency and will be put before ministers this week. They could be unveiled as soon as the weekend, with Mr Johnson keen not to increase lockdown measures until full data is available on how well current measures are working. The rule allowing two from different households exercise together was thrown into confusion after two women were fined for drinking coffees while on a walk five miles from their home. The fines have since been rescinded and policing minister Kit Malthouse said earlier this week people could get a takeaway tea or coffee while exercising. Mr Malthouse said: ""If you're getting coffee on your way to do exercise, or as part of your acquiring food, or one of those reasons you're allowed to be out of the house, then that is legitimate."" The PM's spokesperson also confirmed it was allowed to pick up a coffee with a friend, but stressed that people should stay inside as much as possible during the nationwide shutdown. They also said it was acceptable to rest on a bench during exercise, but it wasn't allowed to leave home just to sit and chat with a friend in the park. Home Secretary Priti Patel has also ruled out tougher restrictions being brought in over the next few days. She told ITV's This Morning: ""This isn't about new rules coming in, we are going to stick with the rules. ""We are not thinking about new measures today or tomorrow, I can say this categorically."" Ms Patel stressed there would be even more efforts to enforce the current rules and hand out fines to anyone refusing to follow them. ""I work with the police every single day, we are working on enforcement of the rules,"" she said. More police officers would be on the streets keeping an eye out for rule-breakers, Ms Patel said earlier this week. But the Home Secretary sparked confusion as she appeared to get the rules wrong. Ms Patel said people should not be cycling with others, suggesting the exemption to exercise with other people could be scrapped. ""The point is exercise on your own and don't use it as a social meeting. ""Cycling is fine because you're on your own, running is on your own."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said he won't scrap the rule unless forced to as it is a ""lifeline"" for many people living alone."

The PM pledged to set up round-the-clock vaccination centres ""as soon as we can"" — and hailed The Sun's Jabs Army drive, urging 450,000 civil servants to join to help the roll-out. It came as a daily record of 1,564 UK coronavirus deaths was announced. Some 400,000 Brits a day could soon get jabs as Covid vaccines are doled out round-the-clock, Government sources said yesterday. The PM vowed doses will be rolled out day and night as a huge stream of vaccines become available.

The pledge came as the NHS started to set up pilot schemes where healthcare workers on night shifts can get the jab. Night-time vaccinations started last month in Israel, where up to 150,000 people a day got the jab before New Year's Eve. Last night a YouGov poll found 43 per cent of Brits would be willing to get the jab between midnight and 6am. More than half said they would take a late-night slot. Despite yesterday's grim landmark, Mr Johnson said we are seeing ""the beginning of some signs"" that lockdown is working. But he warned ""these are early days"" as he pleaded with the public to obey the rules. Hospitals are under ""immense strain"" with 36,489 Covid patients, although confirmed new cases yesterday fell to 47,525.

431,431,The Sun,Harry ColeJonathan Reilly,Donald Trump could declassify top-secret intelligence linking Covid to Wuhan research lab,"DONALD Trump could declassify bombshell secret intelligence about the outbreak of Covid-19 linking it to a Wuhan research lab as one of his last acts as President. Ministers are on ""red alert"" for a major intervention from the outgoing US government within days that claims the origin of the outbreak was a Chinese science facility. They believe the US State Department could reveal evidence of the deadly bug escaping from the lab and even its scientists links to the Chinese Army. On Monday the White House enigmatically warned: ""The world cannot continue to pay heavy prices for its naiveté and complicity in Beijing's irresponsible and harmful practices – whether it is ending the rule of law in Hong Kong or not cooperating with health officials on the pandemic. ""The United States is examining further options to respond."" A well placed diplomatic source told The Sun: ""The US have stopped short of this so far but anything could happen in the coming days and the origin of the virus is top of their list."" And a UK government source added there has been ""increasing chatter"" that Mr Trump and his top diplomat Mike Pompeo were planning a devastating broadside against the Chinese Communist Party over their handling of the outbreak in late 2019. Pushed on the matter yesterday, No10 said it was committed to an investigation into the origin of Covid in China, and called on Beijing to allow the probe to start as soon as possible. The PM's official spokesman said:  ""We've been clear on the investigation and on our desire for it to commence and answer the questions that are still outstanding. ""Investigators are now due to arrive in China and as we've said throughout it's important that their investigation is able to commence without delay and we want it to make sure it is open and transparent and scientifically rigorous."" MPs had previously called on the government to ""take seriously"" reports that the US was now considering a lab leak as the ""most credible"" source of the outbreak. It has previously been suggested that the virus may have escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a high security research lab that specialised in bat coronaviruses. The lab is just a stone's throw from where the outbreak started in the city  - which is also home of the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control. THE WUHAN Institute of Virology is the highest security level of its kind in all of China - and can be found right at the heart of the origins of the global pandemic. Various theories have been swirling about the lab, which is headed up by Chinese scientist Dr Shi Zhengli, known as ""Bat Woman"". Most scientists do not believe the virus leaked from the lab, and the lab itself has categorically denied the claims. The lab specialised in bat-borne viruses and had been carrying out experiences on them since 2015. Airlocks, full body suits, and chemical showers are required before entering and leaving the lab - the first in China to be accredited with biosafety level 4 (BSL-4). BSL-4 labs are the only places in the world where scientists can study diseases that have no cure. Scientists from the lab even tested mysterious virus which killed three miners 1,000 miles away in Yunnan province back in 2012. It has been suggested this fatal mystery bug may have been the true origin of Covid-19. Experts at the lab also engineered a new type of hybrid 'super-virus' that can infect humans in 2015, according to medical journal Nature Medicine Despite fears surrounding the research, the study was designed to show the risk of viruses carried by bats which could be transmitted to humans. There is no suggestion the facility's 2015 work is linked to the pandemic. The lab was also recruiting new scientists to probe coronaviruses in bats just seven days before the outbreak. China has began tightening security around its biolabs with President Xi Jinping saying it was a ""national security"" issue to improve scientific safety at a meeting last February China has long denied that the virus - which most scientists agree occurred naturally - may have escaped from one of its labs. However, the US are claimed to have a whistleblower former scientist from the Wuhan Institute who is working with their intelligence services. The lab was being used to create hybrid coronaviruses for research purposes, but there is no suggestion Covid-19 is manmade. World Health Organisation (WHO) scientists are due to begin a formal probe into the viruses origins this week as they arrive in China. However, the eight-page mission statement for the WHO study makes no reference to investigating the possibility the virus emerged from a lab. The Communist Party has aggressively denied any improper behaviour of its handling of the virus, and scientists at WIV have denied any leak. Beijing has in recent days been attempting to shift the blame away from Wuhan, instead blaming multiple separate global outbreaks. Donald Trump's security advisor Matthew Pottinger - who has since resigned over the Capitol riot - told a group of international politicians the the US is considering the lab leak option. He claimed leaders in China are ""admitting"" there is a chance the theory suggesting Covid-19 started in a ""wet market"" is false. ""There is a growing body of evidence that the lab is likely the most credible source of the virus,"" Pottinger said. He described the incident as a possible: ""Leak or accident."" ""Even establishment figures in Beijing have openly dismissed the wet market story,"" he added. Meanwhile, damning leaked documents unveiled this week showed that China appears to have lied about the virus to ""protect"" its image. Scientists are satisfied that Covid-19 is believed to have originated naturally - crossing from bats, to another animal, and then to humans. Most fingers still point to Chinese wet markets as a possible breeding ground for such viruses. However, it has been suggested a scientist or lab worker may have accidentally allowed the virus to escape, such as either being infected themselves or improperly disposing of waste. No concrete evidence of such a claim has been presented as investigations continue. Pictures previously revealed by The Sun Online showed shoddy conditions inside the lab - despite it being the first in China to be accredited with the highest possible biosafety level. Researchers at the lab also discovered the new infection is 96 per cent similar to the virus they had discovered in bats held in the lab. Meanwhile, in a separate attack on the superpower, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab slapped new restrictions on businesses to stop them profiting from China's ""barbaric"" treatment of Uyghur muslims in Xinjiang province. Mr Raab told the House of Commons of the raft of abuses committed in the Chinese region on the minority muslim population being forced into internment camps for political re-education and forced labour. He also said torture and forced sterilisation was happening to the population ""on an industrial scale."" The Foreign Secretary told MPs: ""It is truly horrific barbarism we had hoped was lost to another era, in practice today, as we speak, in one of the leading members of the international community. We have a moral duty to respond."" China now claims to have mostly returned to normal since the pandemic, with scenes of packed nightclubs, theme parks and sports games now common again. Some 2million have been killed by the virus, while more than 91million have been infected since it first emerged in Wuhan. Britain faces potentially even tougher lockdown rules as infections continue to surge as cops have been urged to be tougher than ever on flouters. China has recorded 87,591 cases and 4,634 deaths, while the UK has suffered 3.1million infections and 83,203 fatalities."
432,432,The Sun,Natasha ClarkSascha O'SullivanMatt DathanHarry Cole,More police to be deployed to streets to fine Covid flouters as Priti Patel blasts ‘minority putting nation at risk’,"STRICTER round-the-clock lockdown enforcement is on the cards if people continue to sneak out, sidestep police and flout Covid rules. The warning came from Home Secretary Priti Patel yesterday as she ordered more officers on to the streets. She told people to obey lockdown rules or face further measures within days. Ms Patel said blame for a crackdown would lie solely with a minority of people who she accused of putting the health of the nation at risk with ""endless egregious breaches"". She added that discussions were ongoing within No10 about tougher restrictions. She said: ""These issues are live in government. The rules are always under review."" It is understood fresh curbs could include an end to click-and-collect shopping and no longer allowing two adults to meet outdoors in a public place for exercise. But ministers strongly denied claims that people could be ordered to stay three metres (10ft) apart. Last night, Downing Street insiders said all this could yet be stopped if everyone stayed at home as asked. Speaking at a No10 press conference, Ms Patel said: ""If you do not play your part, our selfless police officers will enforce the regulations and I will back them to do so."" She revealed that almost 45,000 fixed penalty notices had been issued across the UK during the pandemic but warned that the police were going to get tougher. She said they had orders to proceed more quickly to issuing fines rather than simply moving people on. The Home Secretary was backed by the chairman of the National Police Chiefs Council, Martin Hewitt, who warned there would now be more bobbies on the beat. He told the press conference: ""At this critical time, we will have more dedicated police officers out on dedicated patrols to take action against the small few who are letting us all down."" Mr Hewitt singled out the organiser of a £30-a-ticket boat party in Hertfordshire for particular criticism. He also highlighted organisers of a minibus full of people who went to Wales for a walk and a £10,000 fine for a big party in Essex billed as a business event. And he warned that while organisers would be slapped with large fines, punters would also be hit with financial penalties. But his comments put him at odds with Britain's top police officer. Met Police chief Dame Cressida Dick said orders about staying local were vague and hard to police. She said England should look to Scotland and Wales where a firm distance on how far you can travel from home was written into law. Her comments came after Boris Johnson was criticised after being spotted cycling seven miles from his home. The PM faced claims he undermined the lockdown guidance to stay local. His press secretary Allegra Stratton insisted that his cycle around the Olympic Park in East London on Sunday was permitted, saying he ""acted in accordance with the guidelines"". Downing Street has refused calls to say exactly how far people are allowed to travel to take exercise. But it said the PM wanted to ""encourage all members of the public to exercise once a day"". Meanwhile, ministers finally confirmed you could get a takeaway tea or coffee when walking with a pal. Policing Minister Kit Malthouse said: ""If you're getting coffee on your way to do exercise, or as part of your acquiring food, or one of those reasons you're allowed to be out of the house, then that is legitimate."" Threats of a crackdown by police came as supermarkets Tesco, Asda and Waitrose yesterday vowed to deny entry to shoppers who refused to wear a mask unless they were medically exempt. It followed similar moves by Morrisons and Sainsbury's. Mr Malthouse had urged supermarkets to take responsibility for lax social distancing in stores. The British Retail Consortium said pushing the burden on to shops put staff at risk, adding there had been a sharp rise in violence and abuse against workers. ANYONE who thinks  the police enjoy questioning people in the street for drinking a cup of coffee is living in cloud cuckoo land,  writes Ken Marsh, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation. We don't want to stop people in parks to ask where they're going or how far from home they are. It is not in the British bobby's DNA to enforce the law without compassion or common sense. But we must show tough love to protect people so our policing by consent model has become one of enforcement along more military lines. There's still a hardcore of idiots out there. We need the public to be understanding and also shoulder their own responsibility for staying safe."
433,433,The Sun,Natasha ClarkKate FergusonHarry Cole,Boris Johnson warns he may have to tighten lockdown AGAIN as he cautions against takeaway coffees,"BRITS were last night cautioned against going for takeaway coffees — amid warnings two pals meeting up will be outlawed if people continue to ""flex"" the rules. Boris Johnson and top Tories urged ""exercise, not socialise"" as the Government launched a shock and awe campaign to scare people into staying home. But there was confusion over exactly what is allowed and what is not allowed after police were forced into a humiliating climbdown after fining coffee drinkers in the Midlands. The PM said as he visited a vaccination centre in the South West yesterday: ""We are going to keep the rules under constant review. Where we have to tighten them, we will. ""But we have rules in place which, if properly followed, we believe can make a huge, huge difference."" He urged everyone to stay at home as much as possible to protect the NHS and save lives - and he urged everyone to consider their actions as it was such a ""perilous time"" for the nation. Although he stopped short of telling Brits they shouldn't enjoy a take-away coffee in a park, he added: ""It's now that people need to focus - whether they are out shopping, whether they are buying coffee in the park or wherever it happens to be, they need to think about spreading the disease. ""Because as Chris said, one contact that you have can be a chain of transmission for this disease. ""Now is the moment of maximum vigilance, maximum observation and observance of the rules, and of course if we think things are not being properly observed then we may have to do more."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock later said if people continue to abuse rules that say two can meet up outdoors in public to exercise, then that could soon be scrapped. He told a Downing Street press conference: ""Yes, you can go and exercise in the park with one other person, but only one other person. ""And we have been seeing large groups and that is not acceptable. And you should be two metres apart from the other person. ""If there are too many people breaking this rule then we are going to have to look at it. ""But, I don't want to do that because, for many people being able to go for a walk with a friend, that often is their only social contact."" The PM added: ""When people are getting takeaway drinks, in cafes, then they need to avoid spreading the disease there, avoid mingling too much."" Top doc Prof Chris Whitty also spoke out publicly to warn ""there is a high chance if you meet someone unnecessarily"" you will get Covid. The news comes after Derbyshire Police dropped £200 fines for two women who met for a coffee and walk last week at a local beauty spot. Chief Constable Rachel Swann said: ""Two fixed penalty notices that were handed to two women who had travelled to Foremark Reservoir on Thursday have been withdrawn and we have notified the women directly, apologising for any concern caused."" After repeatedly refusing to clarify the issue, Downing Street finally admitted yesterday lunchtime it was within the rules. The PM's spokesperson said: ""Takeaways are permitted, cafes and restaurants are permitted to allow takeaways. People are permitted to exercise once a day... It shouldn't be used for socialising."" The climbdown came after the PM was accused of stretching the rules by going for a weekend bike ride seven miles from Downing Street. The Derbyshire pair had been fined for travelling five miles from their home, sparking accusations that Mr Johnson had flouted his own rules. However No10 insiders insisted there is no rule against travelling for exercise. Pressed on the restrictions, Mr Hancock said: ""You should stay local, you should not go from one side of a country to another, potentially taking the virus with you."" Brits have been told only to leave their home to exercise, get food or a small list of other reasons as part of the national lockdown to save lives and cut the number of Covid cases down. But parks have been rammed over the weekend as Brits flock to beauty spots to take their exercise. It came as: Around one million people have got the jab in the last week alone - and hundreds of thousands more are set to get it every day. Matt Hancock said on Sunday the figure stood at around 2million. Two out of five care home residents have got their first dose, he added tonight. Almost a quarter of older care home residents have got it - with every care home resident to get it this month. It comes as seven super vaccination centres opened across Britain today - to fulfil the PM's aim of doing 200,000 a day by Friday. 50 will open by the end of the week. Boris has promised that 13million vulnerable Brits will be offered their first jabs by the middle of February. More mass-scale vaccination centres will open in the coming days and weeks. The PM visited one in Bristol to see how the rollout was working. 600,000 Brits who live less than a 45 minute drive away will be written to, asking them to book a slot. The locations are: The PM has promised to inoculate 13.5 million people in just five weeks, and ministers are gearing up for a marathon task. A fuller plan will be published at tonight's press conference, which will be led by Matt Hancock. He will also give an update on how and when everyone can expect to get vaccinated. 2.4 million! 💉💉💉👇🏾👇🏾👇🏾 https://t. co/OZWCzbAwOB"
434,434,The Sun,Harry Cole,Britain set to outlaw Chinese imports with links to human rights abuse,"BRITAIN is to square up to China — by outlawing imports with any links to human rights abuse. Dominic Raab will use the Modern Slavery Act to make firms root out items which are made using forced labour. The Foreign Secretary will also toughen up laws around exporting British goods or technology to China that could be used for repression. The plans will be outlined to MPs tomorrow. Britain's diplomatic ties with Beijing have been strained since claims China tried to cover up the Covid outbreak and following attacks on democracy campaigners in Hong Kong. The Foreign Office has spoken of ""deeply troubling"" evidence of Uyghur Muslims forced to produce cotton. There are fears the textile industry is doing too little due diligence on goods from Xinjiang Province where the Uyghurs are forced to live in ""re-education camps"". But to the dismay of some MPs and campaigners, it is understood Britain will not sanction Communist officials linked to camps and forced sterilization programmes. Officials from Russia, Saudi Arabia and North Korea have been banned from entering Britain or using UK banks. But Whitehall insiders said the so-called Magnitsky powers are not expected to be deployed in China — although it is believed ministers have them in their sights. Tory MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith welcomed crackdown efforts under the Modern Slavery Act but warned the steps were insufficient ""to deal with the growing problem we face with China"". The Foreign Office said last night: ""Our approach to China is rooted in our values and interests. ""However, where we have concerns, we raise them and hold China to account."""
435,435,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson says life-and-death decisions over Covid would have troubled wise old King Solomon,"LIFE-and-death decisions over Covid would have troubled wise old King Solomon, Boris Johnson has claimed. No10 officials are considering the prospect of a further lockdown next month as millions wake today under tough Tier 4 restrictions. In a letter seen by The Sun thanking Whitehall chiefs for their service this year, Mr Johnson said only a ""colossal effort"" had averted a potential disaster. He said fighting the virus has meant ""some of the toughest decisions — indeed Solomonic judgments — that any of us have ever had to take."" Solomon, the Old Testament King of Israel, was renowned for his God-given wisdom. It follows a series of tough decisions by the PM, the latest sparked by a jump in cases caused by the new mutant Covid. He had wanted a five-day relaxation of social restrictions so people could meet indoors at Christmas but was forced into the ""very tough"" call to axe it to one day amid fears get-togethers would see infections rocket further. Millions had to spend Christmas Day alone. Residents already in Tier 4 areas — such as the South East and London — could not lawfully meet others outside their household or support bubbles. Six million more were added to Tier 4 at 00.01am today meaning 24million people, or 43 per cent of England's population, are in lockdown in all but name. Mr Johnson said on Thursday that tougher restrictions may be needed to prevent the mutant strain ""running out of control"". He refused to rule out using January for a third national lockdown, saying it would be a ""tough period."" He added: ""As much as I regret that, I do think it is necessary for us to drive down this virus now to stop it running out of control. ""We need to buy ourselves time to get the vaccine into as many arms of the elderly and vulnerable as we can."""
436,436,The Sun,Harry Cole,Two sex offenders would be hired by 10 Downing Street under potty new plans,"TWO sex offenders would be hired by 10 Downing Street under potty plans revealed by The Sun. Work and Pensions Secretary Thérèse Coffey is pushing for a massive expansion in Whitehall departments employing recent prison leavers. She wants two ex-cons in every government section in a bid to set an example to the private sector. And she urged PM Boris Johnson to lead from the front. Ms Coffey has demanded 10 Downing Street go further by taking on a pair of former prisoners who were convicted of sex crimes, saying it would be seen as an ""action of substance"". Her plans have been met with short shrift by No10 insiders who have so far tried to block the move. One branded it ""a bad idea from TV political farce The Thick Of It"". But two weeks ago Prisons Minister Lucy Frazer appeared to back the idea while giving evidence to MPs. Speaking to the Commons Justice Committee she said: ""I think we need to employ, in the Ministry of Justice in any event, ex-offenders more. ""I have asked the department to look at all our contracts to see how we can employ more ex-offenders through the private providers who we contract with."" The Government has drawn up a target of 150 ex-offenders to work in probation services, something Ms Frazer said was a great start. She added: ""I think the more we can do to get people who can be role models and to support people the better, and it is something I am absolutely committed to."" Downing Street declined to comment on private discussions."
437,437,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson secured Christmas Brexit deal hours after warning Brussels ‘I won’t sign it’ in massive taxes row,"BORIS Johnson secured his landmark Christmas Eve Brexit deal hours after telling Brussels: ""I won't sign it — I won't"" in a massive row about taxes. The livid PM warned the EU its demands to slap trade tariffs on Britain if we did not let them fish our waters forever was a deal breaker. A source told The Sun: ""The PM was ready to walk at that point. ""We were writing a script trying to explain to the world we had blown up a £660billion deal over less than a billion quid of fish."" Mr Johnson's hardline stance saw Brussels blink on the demand late on Tuesday, with the EU asking for a long transition for their fishing boats ""as cover"" for their climbdown. An insider said: ""It meant we could take back control of our waters as we promised at the 2016 referendum. The PM stared them down and it worked."" Mr Johnson says his deal is ""glad tidings of great joy"" for Britain as we will be unshackled from 40 years of Brussels control. Brandishing a copy of the 1,260-page zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement signed with Brussels at 2.44pm on Thursday, the PM quipped: ""I have a small present for anyone who may be looking for something to read in that sleepy post-Christmas lunch moment."" In all, 200 officials — including EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier — spent more than 2,000 hours haggling over details on everything from electric car batteries to mackerel. But during one of the tensest moments of the talks, Mr Johnson's phone line with Brussels seemed to have gone dead. Discussing the initial time EU boats will be allowed to carry on fishing UK waters, the European Commission's president Ursula von der Leyen said: ""Six years."" The PM hit back: ""Five"" — then heard nothing. There was almost three minutes of silence before the No10 switchboard operator told him: ""I'm sorry PM, we seem to have lost the European Commission."" But a distant German voice said: ""No, no, I'm still here. 5½ years?"" Insiders say that was the moment that unlocked the talks and let Mr Johnson — wearing his fish tie — declare that Brexit Britain will be back in ""control of our destiny"" and our waters on January 1. Brussels diplomats met yesterday morning to rubber-stamp the deal that will go to MPs on Wednesday. But ministers were suspicious last night they still had not been shown the full text of the accord. THE full text is yet to be released but both sides have lifted the lid on the contents of the historic accord — which runs to 1,260 pages. Planes, trains and roads will largely be unaffected by the agreement but there will be noticeable differences elsewhere from next year: IMMIGRATION: EU citizens will no longer have the automatic right to move to the UK. Instead they must apply under our new points-based system like the rest of the world. UK travellers will need a visa if they intend to spend more than 90 days a year in the EU. GOODS: THE first zero-tariff, zero-quota deal signed by the EU with a third country will allow unlimited goods to continue flowing freely from Britain to the Continent and back. There are protections for Stilton and Champagne plus approval to carry on shipping animal products. TRADE: The UK will finally be free to strike deals with countries like the United States. The deal will also give some protection to our gigantic financial services industry. LEVEL PLAYING FIELD: A sticking point was whether Brexit Britain could undercut the EU by being more competitive. But it seems the PM saw off attempts to bind the UK to EU rules forever or face its tariffs. Both sides will be able to retaliate if one of their sectors is being hampered by the other. But the devil will be in the detail of how, and what the new joint body to oversee this will look like. EU judges will have no overseer role involving UK law. FISH: EU boats are allowed to carry on fishing UK waters at current rates for another 5½ years. After that there will be a 25 per cent reduction in EU quotas, meaning the UK will fish two thirds of British waters by 2026. The PM promised to spend £100million getting coastal communities ready for big hauls. SECURITY: The UK will no longer be part of the European Arrest Warrant and is locked out of live access to EU databases. But Brits say cross-border cooperation will continue. One told The Sun: ""It feels like it's hiding a very big 'but'."" The accord is due to be published in full this morning. Mr Johnson hopes the compromise on fishing, which means another half-decade before we get control of our waters, will not halt MP approval. He said in a Christmas message: ""This is the feast, full of fish by the way."" Fishing industry figures have already accused Mr Johnson of ""sacrificing"" them. But the PM said the deal brings ""certainty to business, travellers and all the investors in our country — and a happy, successful and stable partnership with our friends in the EU for years to come."" And in a major boost for the PM, Priti Patel tells The Sun today that the deal works for Eurosceptics and will keep the country safe. Home Secretary Ms Patel was among Tories never to back down in 2019 amid claims then-MP Theresa May was selling Britain short. Police chiefs have raised concerns about the loss of the European Arrest Warrant and being locked out of crime databases. But Ms Patel says the agreement includes streamlined extradition arrangements, fast and effective exchange of national DNA, fingerprint and vehicle registration data and continued transfers of Passenger Name Record data. YESTERDAY: Sporting Christmas jumpers, diplomats from the remaining 27 EU countries met to begin rubber stamping the new trade deal. None was expected to veto the deal — not even France. NEXT WEEK: Brit MPs will be recalled to Parliament on December 30 to pass the laws needed for the deal to come into effect. Downing Street is confident it can pass through both Houses in one day. NEW YEAR'S LEAVE: Britain will formally leave the transition period at 11pm on December 31 — and the new trading relationship with Brussels and other countries around the world can formally begin. NEXT MONTH: Euro MPs are furious they have to wait until January to sign off on the deal as time ran out this year for them to have a say. Labour is likely to back the deal despite leader Sir Keir Starmer being the architect of party efforts to frustrate Brexit. He said: ""At a moment of such national significance, it is not credible for Labour to be on the sidelines. That is why I can say today that when this deal comes before Parliament, Labour will accept it and vote for it."" Remainers warned him that doing so would be a mistake and Labour bosses fear a number of frontbench resignations next week. Sir Keir also courted controversy after hinting he could rip up the deal if he wins power in 2024."
438,438,The Sun,Harry ColeNick GutteridgeNatasha Clark,Boris Johnson hails ‘glad tidings of great joy’ in Christmas message after historic £660bn Brexit trade deal,"BORIS Johnson hailed ""glad tidings of great joy"" in a Christmas message last night after sealing his £660billion Brexit trade deal. The PM gave the nation an early Christmas present yesterday as he secured a historic agreement which finally sees the UK take back control from the EU and ends four years of bitter wrangling. Mr Johnson last night punched the air as he proudly showed off the 500-page trade deal. Speaking in a video on Twitter, the PM said: ""Tonight, on Christmas Eve, I have a small present for anyone who may be looking for something to read in that sleepy post-Christmas lunch moment. ""And here it is, tidings, glad tidings of great joy because this is a deal. ""A deal to give certainty to business, travellers, and all investors in our country from January 1. ""A deal with our friends and partners in the EU. ""You remember the oven ready deal by which we came out on January 31, that oven ready deal was just the start - this is the feast, full of fish, by the way. ""And I believe it will be the basis of a happy and successful and stable partnership with our friends in the EU for years to come. ""So, that's it, that's the good news from Brussels, now for the sprouts, and a happy Christmas to you all."" It came as: Mr Johnson received another boost last night as Sir Keir Starmer vowed that Labour would back the deal - meaning it's likely to sail through the Commons next week. Scottish fishing bosses yesterday branded the Brexit deal ""hugely disappointing"" - but are yet to see full details of the agreement. Mr Johnson vowed it was now up to Britain ""as a newly and truly independent nation to realise the immensity of this moment and to make the most of it"" as he revealed a pact to trade freely with Brussels from next year. Four years, five months and 29 days after the British people voted to leave the EU, the PM declared we would finally be able to set our own rules from January 1 and strike out on our own - after 40 years shackled to Brussels. He told the nation at a momentous press conference on Christmas Eve that Brits were ""right to take back control"" and his deal delivered what they voted for back in 2016. Mr Johnson vowed: ""We have taken back control of laws and our destiny. ""We have taken back control of every jot and tittle of our regulation."" Striking a respectful tone, he stressed his deal would finally provide certainty for the police, business, security services and everyone else in the EU and UK alike. And he promised this deal will benefit the whole of Europe, too. In a promise to Brussels he added: ""This deal means a new certainty. ""We will be your friend, your ally, your supporter, and indeed, never let it be forgotten, your number one market."" He described it as a ""jumbo Canada style free trade deal"" which resolves deeply routed discomfort with the European Union. ""I think we were told we couldn't have our cake and eat it,"" he quipped. ""It's what the country needs at this time, and the right way forward for the UK."" He vowed his deal would achieve something which the people ""was told was impossible"". And the Government also revealed there would be a four-year break clause in the deal - meaning there would be the ability for either side to break free in 2025 if they didn't think it was working. The PM poked gentle fun at the EU with a fish-print tie after talks went down to the wire over fisheries. The issue was one of the last sticking points between negotiators - and looked set to de-rail a deal just days ago. The PM tweeted a picture of himself smiling with both thumbs lifted in the air ahead of his press conference. ""The deal is done,"" he wrote. BORIS Johnson said he has ""never known a Christmas"" like this one but said ""sacrifices"" made this year will keep people alive for next year's festive period. In a video posted on Twitter, he said: ""In most years it's a moment for togetherness and celebration in which the generations are jumbled together in the same household for days on end, pulling crackers and snogging under the mistletoe - you name it. ""And yet this year that is the one type of Christmas we simply cannot afford to have."" Mr Johnson said this Christmas was ""not about presents, or turkey, or brandy butter"" but about hope in the form of the Covid vaccines being developed. He added: ""It's thanks to the efforts of wise men and wise women in the east and elsewhere, we have a vaccine and we know that we are going to succeed in beating coronavirus, and that these privations that we're going through are temporary and we know that next year really will be better. ""We know there will be people alive next Christmas, people we love, alive next Christmas precisely because we made the sacrifice and didn't celebrate as normal this Christmas."" Downing Street promised that ""everything promised in the 2016 referendum was now delivered - and we would finally take back control of our money, borders, laws, fishing waters and trade"". They added: ""The deal is fantastic news for families and businesses in every part of the UK. We have signed the first free trade agreement based on zero tariffs and zero quotas that has ever been achieved with the EU. ""The deal is the biggest bilateral trade deal signed by either side, covering trade worth £668bn in 2019."" The record-breaking accord was forged in less than a year- after the withdrawal deal was signed off in January - and will allow free trade to continue without tariffs or quotas in a major win for Britain. It means Britain will avoid a No Deal exit and trade will continue to flow; protecting jobs and allowing Brits to still enjoy holidays and low food prices. The UK will finally cut ties with the bloc's red tape, rules and meddlesome EU judges as promised in the historic 2016 referendum 1,645 days ago, while allowing business and trade to flourish around the globe. And in a major concession, Brussels has dropped demands for powers to hit British goods with tariffs if we shut EU boats out of our waters in future. Boris told The Sun that he was ""absolutely confident this is a deal that protects our police co-operation, protects our ability to catch criminals and to share intelligence across the European continent in the way that we have done for many years."" Meanwhile, EU chief Ursula Von der Leyen used her press conference on Thursday to mock Britain - and said the only real sovereignty was achieved through working together rather than going it alone. In snide comments just minutes after the deal, she said: ""It's about pooling our strength and speaking together in a world full of great powers. ""In a time of crisis, it is about pulling each other up instead of trying to get back to your feet alone."" And she added: ""Parting is such sweet sorry"" but vowed to work together with Britain in future. The deal is done. pic. twitter. com/zzhvxOSeWz I'm very pleased and proud to have led a great UK team to secure today's excellent deal with the EU. Both sides worked tirelessly day after day in challenging conditions to get the biggest & broadest trade deal in the world, in record time. Thank you all who made it happen. Negotiators including chief David Frost worked overnight and into the afternoon yesterday to iron out minor details in the 2,000 page legal text after the crucial fishing deadlock was broken. He said: ""Our country begins a new journey as a fully independent country once again on 1 January. Our future and our prosperity are in our hands. I am confident we will thrive and succeed."" It was suggested that some of the final wrangling was over specific species of fish allowed to be caught. Already MPs came in to praise the PM for securing the deal defying the odds. Trade Secretary Liz Truss tweeted: ""Great that we have secured a trade deal with the EU. Congrats to @DavidGHFrost and the UK team. ""We will have a strong trading relationship with the EU and deepen our trade with partners across the world through our independent trade policy."" Andy Street, the Conservative mayor of the West Midlands, said: ""Absolutely thrilled the Government has achieved a deal with the EU. ""This is critical to the future of thousands of WM jobs and businesses. ""A wonderful early Christmas present."" Even former remainer Prime Minister David Cameron, who called the referendum on leaving the European Union, tweeted: ""It's good to end a difficult year with some positive news. ""Trade deal is very welcome - and a vital step in building a new relationship with the EU as friends, neighbours and partners. ""Many congratulations to the UK negotiating team,"" he added. Business leaders welcomed the trade deal with the EU, saying it had come as a ""huge relief"", despite being so late in the day. Sir Keir Starmer announced this evening that his party will back the trade deal, saying: ""Labour will accept it and vote for it"". He said it was a choice between No Deal and this deal - and his party wouldn't back the latter. ""We have to make a success of this, we have to make it work,"" he said begrudgingly. ""This deal is in the national interest."" But remainers poured cold water on the deal and claimed it would still leave Britain worse off. In a scathing response, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon snapped: ""It beggars belief that in the midst of a pandemic and economic recession Scotland has been forced out of the EU single market and customs union with all the damage to jobs that will bring."" She claimed ""major promises made by the UK Government on fisheries have been broken and the extent of these broken promises will become apparent to all very soon."" And added: ""This is a far harder Brexit than could have been imagined when the EU referendum took place, damaging and disrupting this nation's economy and society at the worst possible time."" The deal is a huge victory for the PM - who endured relentless criticism that he would fail to land an agreement - after his strategy of threatening to walk away without a deal saw the EU blink first. The PM's ""get Brexit done"" at last December's Election gifted him a Tory landslide. Rejecting huge pressure from all sides to drag the talks out for another year because of the Covid crisis, the Prime Minister stood firm and sealed the deal just a week before the 31 December deadline - dubbed New Year's Leave. The news of a deal, which will define our relationship with the EU for years to come, is also a welcome boost after the mounting coronavirus crisis. Yesterday saw 6million more Brits plunged into Tier 4 - amid a gloomy Christmas for the nation. The deal is major win for Britain and a personal success for Mr Johnson at the end of a tricky year navigating a global pandemic. His vow to ""get Brexit done"" at last December's general election gifted him a Tory landslide, but discussions hit the buffers repeatedly over fish, sticking to EU rules, and governance of the deal in future. Commons and Lords speakers announced on Thursday that Parliament will be recalled on 30 December at 9.30am - with hopes to get it all done in a single day. MPs will be able to vote and speak in the debate from home if they wish. But already Brexiteers were grumbling over not having enough time to look over the deal before they are asked to rubber stamp it. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis told LBC: ""I don't really like the idea that Parliament will have to agree a 2,000-page deal in one day."" Tory MP Craig Tracey added: ""On the face of it, the looks to be ticking the major Brexit boxes but need to see the detail - Parliament will vote on it on 30th so plenty of time to go through."" And Nigel Farage warned the UK may ""find ourselves far too closely aligned to EU rules in the years to come"". He is concerned that Britain can't step out line without having extra punishments tacked on. He added that he hoped ""this is the beginning of the end of the European Union."" Mr Farage told talkRADIO: ""Hey, is [the deal] better than where we were five years ago? Yes, it is. Is it good enough to allow us to become Singapore, the really dynamic booming economy? No."" But in the bigger picture, this was a ""very very big day and a big step forward."" The deal is not perfect but it is a big moment. This victory is a tribute to the ordinary men and women who stood up against the Westminster establishment — and won. There is no going back. pic. twitter. com/g2rhgvJOFT Mr Johnson had agreed for Brussels to hand back a quarter of its fish quota - meaning Britain will fish just over 66 per cent of UK waters. And there will be a five-and-a-half-year transition phase, down from the EU's ask of a decade. France crowed on Wednesday that the EU had won ""huge concessions"" from Britain - but Boris said it would mean we finally had control of our own waters. The PM explained: ""For the first time since 1973, we will be an independent coastal state with full control of our waters. ""With the UK's share of fish in our waters rising substantially, from roughly half today, to closer to 2/3 in five and a half years' time after which there is no theoretical limit beyond those placed by science or conservation on the quantity of our own fish that we can fish in our waters."" A £100m programme will be set up to modernise their fleets and the fish processing industry. MPs will be dragged back to the Commons to sign it off next week. The deal will shortly be provisionally approved by member states. EU27 ministers and diplomats on the Council can decides whether to provisionally apply a deal or not - and it can be adopted by written procedure rather than an in-person vote. MEPs can then vote on final ratification early next month. It is four and a half years since the British people voted to take back control of their money, their borders, their laws, and their waters and to leave the European Union And earlier this year we fulfilled that promise and we left on Jan 31 with that oven-ready deal Since that time we have been getting on with our agenda Enacting the points based immigration system that you voted for and that will come into force on Jan 1 And doing free trade deals with 58 countries around the world And preparing the new relationship with the EU And there have been plenty of people who have told us that the challenges of the Covid pandemic have made this work impossible And that we should extend the transition period And incur yet more delay And I rejected that approach precisely because beating Covid is our number one national priority and I wanted to end any extra uncertainty and to give this country the best possible chance of bouncing back strongly next year. And so I am very pleased that this afternoon that we have completed the biggest trade deal yet, worth £660 billion A comprehensive Canada style free trade deal between the UK and the EU, a deal that will protect jobs across this country A deal that will allow UK goods and components to be sold without tariffs and without quotas in the EU market A deal which will if anything should allow our companies and our exporters to do even more business with our European friends And yet which achieves something that the people of this country instinctively knew was doable But which they were told was impossible We have taken back control of laws and our destiny We have taken back control of every jot and tittle of our regulation In a way that is complete and unfettered From Jan 1 we are outside the customs union, and outside the single market British laws will be made solely by the British Parliament Interpreted by UK judges sitting in UK courts And the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice will come to an end We will be able to set our own standards, to innovate in the way that we want, to originate new frameworks for the sectors in which this country leads the world, from biosciences to financial services, artificial intelligence and beyond We will be able to decide how and where we are going to stimulate new jobs and new hope With freeports and new green industrial zones We will be able to cherish our landscape and our environment in the way we choose Backing our farmers and backing British food and agricultural production And for the first time since 1973 We will be an independent coastal state with full control of our waters with the UK's share of fish in our waters rising substantially from roughly half today to closer to 2/3 in five and a half years' time after which there is no theoretical limit beyond those placed by science or conservation on the quantity of our own fish that we can fish in our waters. And to get ready for that moment those fishing communities we will be helped with a big £100m programme to modernise their fleets and the fish processing industry And I want to stress that although of course the arguments with our European friends and partners were sometimes fierce this is, I believe a good deal for the whole of Europe and for our friends and partners as well. Because it will not be a bad thing for the EU to have a prosperous and dynamic and contented UK on your doorstep And it will be a good thing – it will drive jobs and prosperity across the whole continent And I don't think it will be a bad thing if we in the UK do things differently, or a take a different approach to legislation Because in so many ways our basic goals are the same And in the context of this giant free trade zone that we're jointly creating the stimulus of regulatory competition will I think benefit us both And if one side believes it is somehow being unfairly undercut by the other Then subject to independent third party arbitration and provided the measures are proportionate We can either of us decide – as sovereign equals - to protect our consumers But this treaty explicitly envisages that such action should only happen infrequently and the concepts of uniformity and harmonisation are banished in favour of mutual respect and mutual recognition and free trade and for squaring that circle, for finding the philosopher's stone that's enabled us to do this I want to thank President von der Leyen of the European Commission and our brilliant negotiators led by Lord Frost and Michel Barnier, on the EU side Stephanie Rousseau as well as Oliver Lewis, Tim Barrow, Lindsay Appleby and many others their work will be available for scrutiny, followed by a parliamentary vote I hope on Dec 30. This agreement, this deal above all means certainty It means certainty for the aviation industry and the hauliers who have suffered so much in the Covid pandemic It means certainty for the police and the border forces and the security services and all those that we rely on across Europe to keep us safe It means certainty for our scientists who will be able to continue to work together on great collective projects Because although we want the UK to be a science superpower, we also want to be a collaborative science superpower And above all it means certainty for business from financial services to our world-leading manufacturers – our car industry – certainty for those working in high skilled jobs in firms and factories across the whole country. Because there will be no palisade of tariffs on Jan 1 And there will be no non-tariff barriers to trade And instead there will be a giant free trade zone of which we will at once be a member And at the same time be able to do our own free trade deals as one UK, whole and entire, England, NI, Scotland and Wales together. And I should stress this deal was done by a huge negotiating team from every part of the UK, and it will benefit every part of our United Kingdom, helping to unite and level up across the country. And so I say again directly to our EU friends and partners I think this deal means a new stability and a new certainty in what has sometimes been a fractious and difficult relationship We will be your friend, your ally, your supporter and indeed – never let it be forgotten – your number one market Because although we have left the EU this country will remain culturally, emotionally, historically, strategically and geologically attached to Europe not least through the four million EU nationals who have requested to settle in the UK over the last four years and who make an enormous contribution to our country and to our lives. And I say to all of you at home At the end of this toughest of years That our focus in the weeks ahead is of course on defeating the pandemic And on beating coronavirus and rebuilding our economy And delivering jobs across the country and I am utterly confident that we can and will do it by today we have vaccinated almost 800,000 people and we have also today resolved a question that has bedevilled our politics for decades and it is up to us all together As a newly and truly independent nation To realise the immensity of this moment and to make the most of it Happy Christmas to you all That's the good news from Brussels – now for the sprouts"
439,439,The Sun,Harry Cole,More areas to be plunged into Tier 4 lockdown as soon as BOXING DAY as mutant Covid strain causes chaos,"MORE of England will be plunged into the toughest Tier 4 lockdown as soon as Boxing Day, The Sun has learnt. Ministers and medics met last night after the new mutant Covid strain was detected in parts of the South West, Midlands and the North - areas all currently in Tier 2 or 3. An announcement on which areas face the clampdown is expected today - with the measures to kick in immediately after Christmas. The Tier review was due to be reviewed on December 30, but fears the mutant strain is now ""everywhere"" meant it was brought forward. The Sun understands a ""Gold Command"" meeting of public health chiefs and ministers was meeting last night to sign off expanding the hardest lockdown measures beyond London and the South East. Health sources said it would not affect all of England ""but there are many areas that need tougher measures and are seeing dramatic cases numbers."" According to The Mirror, officials discussed plans to put Birmingham, which is currently in Tier 3, into Tier 4 before Christmas - meaning  households in the region would no longer be able to mix on December 25. Boris Johnson has battled to save his ""festive bubbles"" plan to allow families and friends to mix on Christmas Day itself, but medics have warned cases will soar because of it and tougher measures will be needed. Yesterday the Government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance warned: ""I think it's likely that measures will need to be increased in some places, in due course, not reduced."" And a government source said that ""things are moving very quickly."" It comes as... The latest clampdown came on a dark day of soaring covid cases and deaths. Bug cases in the UK again saw their biggest ever daily rise after 36,804 new positive tests and 691 deaths. That daily death toll is the second-highest figure since May and only five short of the 696 deaths posted on November 25, shortly after the second national lockdown was announced. The figures have increased by 37 per cent since last Tuesday's figure of 506 fatalities. And positive tests have also nearly trebled since a fortnight ago, when 12,282 cases were recorded on December 8. Meanwhile the total number of Covid patients in hospital climbed to 18,080 - the highest level since April 22. The hospitalisation figure peaked during the first wave at 21,683 on April 12. Some 18 million people in London and the South East were plunged into Tier 4 on Sunday morning and were given ""stay at home"" orders by the Prime Minister - even over Christmas. But several other parts of the country could also be at risk, where infection rates are high. Burnley, in Lancashire, has the highest Tier 3 infection rate, at 438 cases per 100,000 in the week to December 17. It's four times higher than Gosport, in Hampshire, which has the lowest cases of all Tier 4 areas, at just 159 per 100,000. Boston and Lincoln, both in Lincolnshire and under Tier 3, each have around 400 cases per 100,000 people. And Rushmoor, on the border of locked down Surrey, is a cause for concern. It's under Tier 2 but with an infection rate of 378 cases per 100,000 people - higher than at least 22 Tier 4 areas. Also on the list of at-risk areas are Stoke-on-Trent and East Staffordshire, which each have more than 300 cases per 100,000, according to PA analysis of Public Health England data. By comparison, Tier 4 areas are reporting lower cases of 202 per 100,000 in Chiltern, 232 in North Hertfordshire, 248 in Welwyn Hatfield and 255 in Mole Valley. Places in Tier 2 and Tier 3 with the highest infection rates: Burnley, Tier 3: 438 cases per 100,000 Lincoln, Tier 3: 409 cases per 100,000 Boston, Tier 3: 406 cases per 100,000 Rushmoor, Tier 2: 378 cases per 100,000 Stoke-on-Trent, Tier 3: 341 cases per 100,000 Pendle, Tier 3: 338 cases per 100,000 Rugby, Tier 3: 337 cases per 100,000 East Staffordshire, Tier 3: 331 cases per 100,000 West Lindsey, Tier 3: 323 cases per 100,000 Wealden, Tier 2: 323 cases per 100,000 Uttlesford, Tier 2: 313 cases per 100,000 Wolverhampton, Tier 3: 300 cases per 100,000 Places in Tier 4 with the lowest infection rates: Gosport: 159 cases per 100,000 Chiltern: 202 cases per 100,000 North Hertfordshire: 232 cases per 100,000 Welwyn Hatfield: 248 cases per 100,000 Mole Valley: 255 cases per 100,000 Guildford: 260 cases per 100,000 Windsor and Maidenhead: 273 cases per 100,000 Dacorum: 277 cases per 100,000 West Berkshire: 278 cases per 100,000 Wokingham: 300 cases per 100,000 East Hertfordshire: 305 cases per 100,000 Stevenage: 312 cases per 100,000 The timing of the next planned Tier review has sparked fears of a ""New Year's Eve blowout"", according to Health sources. Tier decisions are normally implemented 48 hours later after the review, but there is concern New Years parties may be harder to police on the eve of another major lockdown. A source said: ""If you announce on the 30th that everyone is going into lockdown in two days' time then its obvious people will go over the top."" While plans for Christmas mixing in a limited manner are to go ahead, there will be a tough line on celebrating the new year. Police have been told to strictly enforce Tier rules that night amid concerns large parties will spread the virus. It comes after a Sage scientist warned the UK was facing catastrophe amid the mutant strain chaos. Sir Patrick Vallance said last night the new Covid strain was spreading at terrifying speed. He said: ""It's more transmissible, we've absolutely got to make sure we've got the right level of restrictions in place. ""I think it is likely that this will grow in numbers of the variant across the country, and I think its likely therefore that measures are going to need to be increased in some places, not reduced."" Meanwhile, Sage scientist Professor Robert West, a psychologist at University College London, said an ""economic human and social disaster"" would follow unless the Government built up contact tracing systems similar to ones in East Asia. He told the Guardian: ""We need to reset our strategy and move rapidly to a zero Covid strategy of the kind that many have been proposing. ""It sounds expensive but the alternative could well be a catastrophic collapse in confidence in the country's ability to control the virus and the economic, human and social disaster that would follow."" And UCL professor of infectious diseases, Andrew Hayward has pushed for a third national lockdown. I think it is likely that this will grow in numbers of the variant across the country, and I think its likely therefore that measures are going to need to be increased in some places, not reduced. He said: ""I think it's clearer to give a consistent national message because although the levels of risk are different in different parts of the country, they're still there and they're still substantial."" The Prime Minister has denied suggestions that a third national lockdown is imminent, but he acknowledged at Monday's Downing Street press conference that significant restrictions were likely to remain in place for months - he insisted, however, it would be a ""very different world'"" by Easter. Already a third of the country are in Tier 4 - the new highest level of restrictions like lockdown. At the weekend Boris Johnson was forced to tell people living within those areas to cancel their Christmas plans and stay at home once again. And Brits across the country have been given ""stay local"" orders for their smaller Christmas celebrations, to stop the virus spreading. Meanwhile, Christmas bubbles were almost entirely scrapped with those living in Tiers 1, 2 and 3 only able to meet loved ones for one day.

440,440,The Sun,Harry Cole,Ministers to unveil £7.5million package to help tackle loneliness in victory for The Sun’s Christmas Together campaign,"MINISTERS will today unveil a £7.5million package to help tackle loneliness — in a victory for The Sun and our Christmas Together campaign. We have been encouraging readers to support those feeling isolated and anxious because of tough Covid curbs and the Government has heard our call to do more. The cash will be targeted immediately at the most vulnerable, through community libraries, charities and radio projects that work to ensure no one feels isolated. Of the £7.5million, £5million will go to the Arts Council England for arts and library services. A further £2million will be used to extend the Government's loneliness fund and £500,000 to be distributed amongst funds which help local radio stations survive. Minister for Civil Society Baroness Barran told The Sun: ""The next few months will be a worry for many people who have felt particularly isolated or lonely during the pandemic. ""It is important we continue to provide support to those most at risk of isolation and loneliness over the next few months. ""There is already such important work being done in the arts, library and radio sectors to help bring people together and tackle loneliness."" THIS Christmas we are teaming up with the Together Campaign, a coalition of community groups and organisations, and Royal Voluntary Service to combat loneliness. And we want to recruit an army of volunteers to support those feeling cut off, anxious and isolated, this Christmas. Could YOU reach out to someone who might be struggling and alone? It might be someone you know in your own life or community who needs support. Or we can connect you with someone in need through the NHS Volunteer responder programme run by the NHS, Royal Voluntary Service and the GoodSAM app. Could you give up half an hour to make a call and chat with someone feeling  isolated? Or could you volunteer to deliver essential shopping or festive treats? Go to nhsvolunteerresponders. org. uk/christmastogether to sign up as a volunteer. You will then receive an email taking you through the sign up process and be asked to download the responder app which will match you to those in need in your area. Don't worry if you don't get a job straight away, because jobs are matched according to the need local to you.  Being ready to help is what really matters."
441,441,The Sun,Matt DathanHarry ColeNick GutteridgeSascha O'Sullivan,Stranded Brit truckers on the move again as shamed Emmanuel Macron is forced to reopen French border,"STRANDED truckers were ready to roll again last night after shamed French leader Emmanuel Macron was forced to reopen his country's border with the UK. He caved in after pressure from Britain and the EU to end a 48-hour blockade imposed amid fears over the new Covid strain. Drivers destined for France can now show any recognised Covid test to gain entry. Yesterday truckers trapped at Dover vented fury at Macron. Geordie Peter Graham, 51, said ""This is all about Brexit — I don't think it's anything to do with the virus. ""France are trying to blackmail us into doing a deal or saying, 'this is what it will be like for you' if not. ""Both sides need to come to an agreement - but Boris needs to stand his ground and not give in to them."" Fellow trucker, dad-of-three Keith Murray, 34, fumed: ""I think Macron is a wally. ""I honestly don't believe for one minute this is coronavirus-related."" PM Boris Johnson deployed the military to UK ports to carry out tests on up to 6,000 lorry drivers a day. Troops started roadside testing in the early hours of today. Once a driver is tested, they receive a text message about 20 minutes later revealing whether they are negative or positive. If given the all clear they can drive to the port and straight on to ferries. The Government also sent six food vans to feed hungry hauliers stuck in the makeshift overflow car park at Manston airfield, Kent. The agreement to reopen the border — struck last night — will be reviewed at the end of the month. This is all about Brexit — I don't think it's anything to do with the virus Britain will pay for the tests but a government source insisted it was in the UK's interests to get freight moving. Downing Street warned it could take days to clear the backlog of more than 3,000 trucks in and around Dover. The source warned that the testing regime ""won't be perfect"" straightaway as it is the first such testing in the UK. Hauliers were urged not to rush to Kent until the backlog has been cleared. President Macron had wanted every lorry driver to have a PCR test, which takes at least 24 hours to deliver a result. Mr Johnson resisted the demand over fears it would cause a lengthy backlog of trucks waiting at the border. The source blasted Mr Macron for causing the chaos, and said: ""He will be the most relieved of everyone. ""He boxed himself in and then realised many of the people he's left trapped in Kent are French."" France shut its UK border on Sunday at 11pm — concerned by a mutant strain of Covid hitting London and South East England. The move cut off goods supplies and sparked panic buying ahead of Christmas. The PM and Mr Macron had been trying to find a resolution. Yesterday lunchtime the French leader was embarrassed when the EU Commission issued a stinging rebuke saying his reaction to the new Covid strain had been over the top. A recommendation requested by all 27 European capitals said rapid testing units proposed by the UK Government should be accepted and deployed at ports and airports across the EU to screen British arrivals. It added: ""Any prohibition of transport services, such as flight or train bans, should be discontinued."" The breakthrough came after the PM spoke to EU chief Ursula von der Leyen twice on Monday night. The diktats from the EU Commission are not legally binding on member states but are designed to replace the patchwork of restrictions capitals slapped on Britain in a panicked response to the mutant strain. Poland was said to be furious with the French as its blockade had left many Polish truckers stranded at Dover. The Transport Secretary was hailed as the key figure in brokering an agreement. Announcing the breakthrough, his French counterpart Jean-Baptiste Djebbari tweeted: ""Thank you Grant Shapps for the amazing work we have done in the last 48 hours."" Yesterday the boss of the Food and Drink Federation Ian Wright told MPs supermarket shelves would be left empty within 24 hours unless the border was reopened."

The review was set to take place on December 30, but fears New Years parties may be harder to police on the eve of another major lockdown means the clampdown could come as soon as tomorrow, the Sun has learnt. Ministers and medics met on Tuesday night after the new Covid strain was detected ""everywhere"", including in the parts of the South West, Midlands and the North - areas all currently in Tier 2 or 3.

Police have been told to strictly enforce Tier rules that night amid concerns large parties will spread the virus. But a police chief warned Tier 4 rules ""don't make sense"" and they ""won't be knocking on doors"" to check Brits are following the lockdown rules. Ken Marsh, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, slammed the new restrictions as ""baffling"". ""We're not going to be knocking on people's doors on Christmas Day. We have no power of entry,"" he told the MailOnline. Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty has warned Boris Johnson that the number of patients in hospital with Covid is on course to match the April peak by New Year's Eve, the Daily Mail reports.

Sir Patrick Vallance said the new Covid strain was spreading at terrifying speed. ""It's more transmissible, we've absolutely got to make sure we've got the right level of restrictions in place,"" he said last night. ""I think it is likely that this will grow in numbers of the variant across the country, and I think its likely therefore that measures are going to need to be increased in some places, not reduced."" In a grave warning, Sir Patrick added: ""I think it is a case that this will spread more."" He said it was already ""everywhere"" after other health experts confirmed it was now in every region of the country. Cases in London have doubled in the last week alone. And there are now eight places across the UK - from Medway to Boston - which have recorded more than 1000 cases per 100,000. More of England will now be plunged into Tier 4 lockdown as soon as Boxing Day, the Sun understands. An announcement on which areas face the clampdown could come as soon as tomorrow - with the measures to kick in immediately after Christmas.

""It sounds expensive but the alternative could well be a catastrophic collapse in confidence in the country's ability to control the virus and the economic, human and social disaster that would follow."" Another Sage scientist, Professor John Edmunds, told the Today programme: ""Unfortunately, it does look like the virus is probably across the country already and so I do think that we might, unfortunately, have to impose tougher restrictions across the country."" The Prime Minister, while denying suggestions a third national lockdown was imminent, acknowledged at Monday's Downing Street press conference, significant restrictions were likely to remain in place for months, but insisted it would be a ""very different world'"" by Easter. Home Secretary Priti Patel also warned this morning ministers would take ""all necessary steps"" to contain the mutation - and would not rule out a fresh national lockdown. When asked about whether a nationwide lockdown was inevitable, Ms Patel said: ""I think it's important to remember, as we've seen this virus spread, grow and evolve, the Government, working with our scientific advisers, will take all the necessary steps to contain this."" Speaking to Sky News, she said: ""This is a stronger strain of the virus, it's more transmittable. It's a bouncy virus, so obviously people can catch it in a much easier way."" The bug is blamed for 1.7 million deaths worldwide, including more than 68,000 in the UK, the second-highest death toll in Europe, behind Italy's 69,000. It comes as the European Union said travel from the UK should be ""discouraged"" due to fears about the mutant strain of the virus, but bans on movement should be lifted. EU justice commissioner Didier Reynders said: ""Member states should take co-ordinated action to discourage non-essential travel between the UK and the EU."" But ""at the same time, blanket travel bans should not prevent thousands of EU and UK citizens from returning to their homes"". Despite the European Commission recommendations, Ireland extended restrictions on travel from Great Britain until December 31, banning flights and sea crossings. More than 40 countries around the world have banned flights from the UK due to the mutant variant of the bug. The World Health Organisation's European chief Hans Kluge said limiting travel to contain the spread of the new variant was ""prudent"", but supply chains for ""essential goods"" and essential travel ""should remain possible""."
443,443,The Sun,Nick GutteridgeHarry Cole,Boris Johnson takes charge of Brexit talks in last ditch effort to thrash out deal on fish,"BORIS Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen have taken personal charge of thrashing out a deal on fish as Brexit talks reach their climax. Some officials on both sides are hopeful a deal could be reached as early as tomorrow if talks continue to go smoothly but there are growing fears relations with France may explode chances of a compromise. The PM and the Commission chief are now locked in frequent phone calls trying to find a breakthrough on the last stumbling block - access for EU boats to British waters. They pair have set up a direct hotline between Downing St and the EU HQ ""part and parcel"" of the final stretch of negotiations. A senior source on the UK side told The Sun ""there is a deal on the table now and both sides want to be home for Christmas Eve, but things are strained."" No10 sources say there is still a way to go and Mr Johnson is understood to be ""incandescent"" at France's behaviour over closing Calais because of mutant Covid. Another insider said the PM's stance had ""hardened"" in recent days because of President Macron. The source said: ""There's a real chance relations with the French sink this whole thing, if there was ever a time to tell them to get stuffed, this might be it."" It was noticeable that Ms von der Leyen's EU Commission called for the travel ban on the UK to be lifted on Tuesday afternoon, while the French were still playing hardball. Yesterday EU negotiator Michel Barnier said: ""We are really in the crucial moment. We are giving it the final push."" The PM presented a new British offer on fishing during two phone calls with Mrs von der Leyen last night. He proposed EU boats give back 35 per cent by value of their current catches in UK waters, to be phased in over five years. Experts said that would leave British vessels landing 72 per cent of fish by value by 2026. But EU officials have rejected the plan and are pushing for a longer transition of about seven years and a reduction of just 25 per cent. Both sides have moved a significant way from their last ""final offers"" giving the last hours and days of talks a fresh boost. The EU had originally demanded a decade long transition to London's three, with hours of ""tortured"" talks whittling that down to a possible compromise. Brussels wanted an 18 per cent reduction on quota share, with the Brits moving significantly from their 80 per cent cut opening offer. There is also an ongoing tussle about the terms of access European boats will enjoy to British waters. A possible landing zone may see the UK able to shut EU vessels out, but at the risk of retaliatory tariffs across the trade deal. Brussels could apply to an independent arbiter for the right to apply ""rebalancing measures"" equal to the value of the fishing opportunities lost. European boats land just under £600 million a year in our waters, meaning the maximum tariffs on British foods would be £400 million. It is understood Mrs von der Leyen is keen to wrap-up a deal and is now heavily lobbying coastal Member States to accept a compromise. She is said to be ""in constant contact with all parties involved"" and is likely to consult key figures including Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel. FISHING: The EU wants continued access to Britain's fishing waters after we leave. It's claimed Britain would be happy with a five year deal to phase out access, but the EU have pushing for eight. One of the key referendum claims was that Britain would be able to take back control of our borders - including fish - when we leave the EU. LEVEL PLAYING FIELD: Brussels wants a shared set rules and standards to ensure businesses in the UK do not have an unfair advantage over their competitors. The UK has said it won't lower its standards, but wants to be able to set its own rules. GOVERNANCE: Who decides what happens if the terms of the deal are breached? The EU wants an European body to decide the terms, but the UK aren't keen on this and want an independent arbitrator to have the final say. Parliament formally rose and MPs headed home last week, but politicians could return before New Year's in order to vote for a deal if needed. The EU Parliament's deadline for agreeing a pact has also passed, but there are mechanisms in place for leaders of the bloc to ratify the deal if necessary, and MEPs could vote early next year."
444,444,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says Covid border shutdown proves Britain’s ready for No Deal Brexit,"THE mutant Covid border shutdown has proved Britain is ready for a No Deal Brexit, Grant Shapps insists. The Transport Secretary says work on emergency plans in the light of trade talks collapsing had been ""brought forward by a few weeks"". And heaping pressure on Brussels to climb down in negotiations, Mr Shapps added this had helped avoid significant chaos with the French travel ban. He claimed 500 backed-up lorries in Dover, Kent, had been whittled down to 170 in 24 hours, with measures to control overflow working smoothly — though industry officials disputed this. Mr Shapps said: ""Some of the reason we are not seeing big problems in Kent is because work going on for very many months, years even, is coming to fruition — a little earlier than anticipated. ""To a large extent, it shows we are ready."" Yet last night, hopes of a trade deal soared amid claims the EU had reduced demands for a fishing transition period from ten years to five. Work going on for very many months is coming to fruition. To a large extent, it shows we are ready. It is understood Brussels could settle on around a 35 per cent reduction in quotas — a £140million per year boost to UK fishing. Earlier, Boris Johnson had shot down demands to extend the transition period past the end of the year. He was backed by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who claimed: ""I don't want an extension, I want a deal."" SNP chief Nicola Sturgeon, London Mayor Sadiq Khan and some Tory MPs said Brexit should be delayed due to Covid. They want the UK kept in the EU's single market and customs union until the end of March. But the idea was dismissed by officials, who said a delay would be pointless if legally possible. The EU would rather negotiate right up to December 30 and sign off a deal via email if necessary."
445,445,The Sun,Ellie CambridgeNick ParkerHarry ColeJoe Duggan,Lorry drivers slapped with PARKING FINES for pulling into laybys after France travel ban leaves them stranded overnight,"LORRY drivers have been slapped with parking fines for pulling into Kent laybys after France's travel ban left them stranded overnight. The M20 was closed with hundreds of lorries marooned in Kent as Emmanuel Macron's travel ban sparked food shortage warnings. Lorries were stuck in huge lines on the motorway after the UK ban ordered by Mr Macron over the mutant Covid strain. Highways England said 900 lorries were parked on the M20 at 6pm on Monday, but an hour earlier the PM had insisted the number was around 170. Mr Johnson pleaded with French President Mr Macron for an end to the  chaos as Highways England closed the M20 due to heavy freight numbers heading towards Dover and the Eurotunnel in Folkestone. Operation Brock was rolled out to deal with the congestion, with the M20 closed between junctions seven and nine until 8am this morning as a contraflow barrier was installed. Traffic wardens handed parking fines to furious truckers on a slip road to the M20, with the penalties branded an ""insult to injury"". Defiant HGV drivers vowed not to pay, but Hythe and Folkestone Council insisted the fines were appropriate. A council spokesman told the i: ""There are official lorry parks which should be used by drivers rather than coming off the designated routes and parking illegally in areas that were never designed for such use. ""Whilst the current situation might seem unusual, local residents have endured unpleasant impacts whenever there is cross channel disruption. ""We've been informed that there is plenty of space in the official areas designated for lorries waiting to cross the channel and clear signage is in place to direct drivers to these."" It comes as Mr Johnson vowed to test all lorry drivers transporting goods across the Channel to halt the disruption. The government is believed to be ramping up plans to allow thousands of truckers to be tested for Covid-19, The Telegraph reports. France has demanded all truckers must test negative before being allowed to enter at Calais. Around 6,000 of the PCR Covid tests wanted by France - which take up to 48 hours for results - a day would be needed to administered at the Manston site. HGVs arriving in Kent tonight will be diverted to nearby Manston Airport to park, with a contraflow system reopening the M20 in both directions tomorrow. At Monday's Downing Street press conference, Mr Johnson said the number of lorries queuing on Kent's M20 had been slashed from 500 to 170 after Operation Stack was implemented. It came after the Prime Minister chaired an emergency meeting of the Cobra committee to address the crisis. He added the government was working ""with our friends across the Channel to unblock the flow of trade as fast as possible"" and revealed he had a ""excellent"" conversation with French President Mr Macron. Both leaders were working on a fix to allow freight to flow as fast as possible with hopes of a breakthrough ""in the next few hours"", Mr Johnson said. The PM assured Brits supermarket supply chains were ""strong and robust"", with the risk of transmission from lorry divers ""very low"". And he said the French ban only affected 20 per cent of human-handled freight brought by lorry drivers. Mr Johnson said of his call with Mr Macron: ""It was an excellent conversation with the French President, he stressed he was keen, I would say, to sort it out in the next few hours if we can. ""Our teams will be working on it flat out - if we can get a result then, that would be great, but we will do it as fast as we can."" He added: ""It is vital to stress these delays, which are only occurring at Dover, only affect human handled freight. ""That is only 20 per cent of the total arriving or departing to the European continent. ""Which means the vast majority of food medicines and other supplies are coming and going as normal."" The PM also confirmed more than half-a-million people in the UK have been received their first dose of the Pfizer-Biotech Covid vaccine. Boris was joined by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance at tonight's briefing. Mr Shapps said remaining lorries queuing in Kent were in a holding area, and pleaded with people not to travel to Kent. The Transport Secretary said a contraflow system will be set up on the M20 motorway in Kent to alleviate pressure on the road. Mr Shapps said: ""We'll use the moveable barrier which has been constructed on the motorway, on the M20, and that enables us to set up a contraflow.... in just a few hours overnight and that will enable traffic to flow in both directions on the motorway. ""That's part of what's called Operation Brock."" He added: ""What's happened today has been the equivalent of what might happen in very severe weather conditions, sometimes if there's a strike over in Calais."" Fed-up lorry drivers stranded in jams in Kent spoke out as the chaos continued. Eric Johnson, 50, from Birmingham said: ""Apparently all the laybys nearby are booked up and the truck stops are basically full too. For a lot of us getting here later on, there's nowhere else to go."" Irish trucker Damien Doherty, 42, said: ""My wife is worried sick I won't be home for Christmas. ""I was literally the last lorry in the Port last night before they shut it. ""Thankfully I managed to get it shipped out in time as it's a very expensive load of perishable fish. ""Now I've been stuck here ever since. My wife is worried sick I won't be home for Christmas."" Meanwhile, Sir Patrick warned more parts of England could be plunged into Tier 4 to control the mutant virus spreading further. He said: ""The evidence on this virus is that it spreads easily, it's more transmissible, we absolutely need to make sure we have the right level of restrictions in place. ""I think it is likely that this will grow in numbers of the variant across the country and I think it's likely, therefore, that measures will need to be increased in some places, in due course, not reduced. ""I think it is the case that this will spread more."" The French said this morning ""in the next few hours"" protocol would be established ""to ensure movement from the UK can resume"", with this expected to be touched on in a press conference this afternoon. Officials in Dover confirmed inbound freight was due to come into the country, but the huge queues and disruption will continue to cause chaos for the rest of the day. Transport Minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari said earlier: ""In the coming hours, at European level, we will be putting in place a solid health protocol so that flows from the United Kingdom can resume. ""Our priority: protect our nationals and fellow citizens."" It was reported today Mr Macron said France ""will most probably ask"" for negative Covid tests to be shown before entering from the UK as part of the row-back. Tap the links below to find out more... Around 10,000 lorries travel into the country via Dover every day, bringing in 20 per cent of all goods bought and sold in the UK. Supermarkets feared major shortages of food and Christmas goods after the border closure, as hundreds of trucks sat with fresh vegetables and fruit in their trailers. Sainsbury's warned some products could be missing from shelves due to restrictions at ports, but said food for a traditional Christmas lunch is available and already in the country. A spokesperson said: ""All products for the Great British Christmas lunch are already in the country and we have plenty of these. ""If nothing changes, we will start to see gaps over the coming days on lettuce, some salad leaves, cauliflowers, broccoli and citrus fruit - all of which are imported from the Continent at this time of year."" The news sparked panic buying this morning, with shoppers lining up outside supermarkets at 5am to stock up on Christmas supplies. Despite the rain, queues were seen outside one Waitrose store in Henleaze, near Bristol, in the early hours of today. And another Brit shared a snap of him waiting with other shoppers at 5.50am to get toilet paper. Supermarkets have urged people not to panic buy and Tesco insisted its stocks would not be affected by the 48-hour blockade. There was chaos at Britain's busiest port in Dover overnight as people were left stranded in the cold after the sudden closure. The port was closed, sparking fears for deliveries to and from Calais in the lead up to Christmas. Prolonged restrictions on Dover trade could have ""quite dramatic"" ramifications for the UK, the port's boss warned today. Doug Bannister said: ""This is trade that's being denied from both British and European enterprise so a prolonged period will have quite a stark situation. ""Because of the importance of the Dover straits in handling critical goods such as food and other things like that I think it could become quite dramatic."" A worker outside Dover was heard shouting: ""No lorries. It's shut,"" this morning while emphatically crossing his arms at drivers who had no clue about what happened overnight. Haulier Matt Richards, 50, from Wolverhampton was stuck in his vehicle from 8pm after he was trapped in by other vans. He said: ""I was driving towards the Port when my phone started pinging about the closure. France banned British lorries from travelling to and from the country at 11pm last night, issuing a blockade for 48 hours. Thousands of lorries due to cross the Channel today were told to stay away from Kent ports. Those carrying fresh food and other items were faced with 'borders closed' signs and turned away. Lorries could potentially be stranded in Britain, which sparked fears drivers would stay away and disrupt the supply chain. Ports were already facing confusion and chaos due to No-Deal Brexit fears. But this morning the French Government said it was working on a solution, and Dover officials said incoming lorries were still arriving today. ""It's absolutely ridiculous to make such a last minute snap decision. They should have given everyone a bit more time to prepare. I only want to get home to Wolverhampton now."" Mr Richards, who delivered two £1million Covid-19 testing machines to Toulouse, France last week, was set to bring another to Italy by December 28 but now fears he won't be able to make it. But supplies of the Covid vaccine to the UK will not be affected, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said this morning. An industry source said: ""Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse — disaster on top of disaster. I fear for supermarket supply chains. ""It's the panic buying we are most worried about. The chains have held up all year but only if people are sensible."" Lorry drivers were arriving in Dover throughout the night and into the morning, only to be turned away by cops and port authorities, with huge queues of goods vehicles at the border this morning. Queues stretched seven miles at ports in both Britain and France as the ban added to existing worries over Christmas stockpiling and Brexit uncertainty. Patrols have been seen on the Scotland and Wales borders - to ensure people don't travel. It is feared the EU could ban all flights into the UK from tonight over the new strain which is causing havoc in the country. The Welsh Government has requested ""urgent"" talks with the UK Government after ferry passengers in Wales were banned from entering the Republic of Ireland. Ireland is allowing freight and essential travel from ports in North Wales and West Wales, but has said other visitors will not be granted entry. The new mutant strain causing the sudden ban is feared to be 70 per cent more infectious. However, Mr Shapps said the new strain is not unique to the UK, adding: ""We detected that first but we know already that the cases have been found in continental Europe and other countries, including countries which have placed travel bans - the Netherlands, for example - actually have much higher case rates per 100,000 than the UK at the moment. ""So I think it stands to reason that, once people look at this, they'll probably realise that it's actually already in their domestic coronavirus case load."" Fears the blockade could disrupt vital supplies of the Pfizer Biotech vaccine to the UK - which is made in Belgium - were eased this morning as Mr Shapps said supply would not be hit. Mr Shapps told Sky News: ""There's no issue (with the vaccine) at all. Most of the vaccine does not come on a.. roll in, roll off... in other words it's not accompanied by a driver it comes on containers. ""There are good supplies in the meantime so there won't be an impact on the vaccination programme. ""But it's obviously important we get this resolved with the French and that's what we'll be trying to do today."" Military aircraft could airlift supplies of the vaccine from Belgium if the freight ban stays in place for longer than 48 hours, The Department of Health confirmed. A government spokesman said last night: ""As a result we are urging everybody – including all hauliers - to avoid travelling to Kent ports until further notice. ""We are working closely with Kent Resilience Forum, Kent Council and Highways England to ensure contingency measures are urgently put in place to manage disruption, and the Prime Minister will chair a COBR meeting tomorrow to discuss the situation."" Shortly afterwards, Operation Stack, the emergency measure to avoid gridlock in Kent, kicked in along the coastbound M20, with the road between junctions 8 and 11 closed to traffic. Ministers have been preparing for months for border chaos from a possible No Deal Brexit and will bring forward contingency plans. EU states will discuss their response to the new virus strain in a call this morning. It has now reportedly been found in Italy. Germany, Holland, Belgium, Austria and Bulgaria were also halting flights. Trains to Belgium were suspended and Ireland introduced a 48-hour ban on travellers from midnight. Ian Wright, of the Food and Drink Federation, said the suspension of  freight traffic could cause ""serious disruption"". He added: ""Continental truckers will not want to travel here if they fear  getting marooned. ""The Government must very urgently persuade the French government to exempt accompanied freight from its ban."" One trucker wrote: ""I've got two trucks in Dover, one was put on the boat to Calais, the other has been told to go home. Some excellent consistency there."" The moves came as Brits raced into a Christmas exodus to try to save their festivities. In London, St Pancras Station was rammed with people desperate to visit family. Amid scenes later slammed by Health Secretary Matt Hancock, commuter Harriet Clugston, who filmed the crowds, compared the scenes to the fall of Saigon in the Vietnam War. She tweeted: ""Last train out of Saigon. Queue at St Pancras as we wait to board the Leeds-bound train. As expected, train is crammed."" Eurostar rail tickets sold out in less than an hour amid rumours of the French ban. A 21-year-old engineering student trying to travel home to Brussels said the British government had ""just created chaos"". The shock Tier 4 rules imposed on London and parts of the South East mean people are only supposed to leave their areas for limited reasons — such as for work, education or caring responsibilities. International travel is similarly restricted. Within an hour of Mr Johnson's bombshell announcement on Saturday evening, Londoners jumped into cars, taxis and even rental vehicles to escape the city. Roads such as the A40 clogged up and airports like Heathrow were packed. The National Police Chiefs' Council told The Sun ""blatant"" rule-breakers would receive fixed-penalty notices. Leader Martin Hewitt said: ""These restrictions will be upsetting for many after a very challenging year. ""But most people will want to do what they can to protect public health and the health of their loved ones. We urge everyone to follow the rules in their area. ""We are confident that the majority of people will continue to do their best to adapt and do the right thing. ""Those who blatantly ignore the regulations should expect to receive a fixed penalty notice. Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse — disaster on top of disaster. I fear for supermarket supply chains ""Clear guidance will be developed for officers who are policing these regulations, and they will continue to play their part in helping the public navigate and understand changes in their area."" British Transport Police revealed they were boosting officer numbers across the southern transport network to ensure people were making only essential journeys. Assistant Chief Constable Sean O'Callaghan said his force's policing method ""remained the same"" — with officers engaging with passengers and dishing out fines if ""absolutely necessary"". The Met Police warned the ""most dangerous and flagrant breaches"" of Tier 4 regulations would be hit with penalties, tweeting: ""Don't risk a fine in the lead up to Christmas."" In Scotland, cops said they would double their presence along the border after First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a clampdown. Police Scotland Chief Constable Iain Livingstone said ""highly visible patrols"" on roads would be used to ""deter anyone who might be considering breaching the coronavirus travel restrictions"". An initial ban would last until Britain leaves the EU on January 1, but the source added Berlin is already ""working on measures"" to extend the flight ban beyond that date. It comes after a German government official earlier told the DPA news agency restrictions on flights were a ""serious option"". Ireland has also announced similar measures banning flights from the UK for the first time in history."
446,446,The Sun,Harry Cole,Keir Starmer branded Captain Hindsight after claiming Government failed to act quickly enough on new Covid strain,"SIR Keir Starmer was branded Captain Hindsight after claiming the Government had failed to act quickly enough on the new Covid strain. The Labour leader sparked fury by stating the variant was ""spotted in September"" and PM Boris Johnson had chosen to ""ignore alarm bells"". NHS England said they were aware of the strain only in mid-October with its significant transmission hike confirmed last week. Tory chair Amanda Milling said: ""It's irresponsible of Sir Keir to make claims when he doesn't possess the facts — a global pandemic is no time to be peddling falsehoods. ""If Captain Hindsight is so sure, let the country know where he got his facts from for this sheer attempt at political opportunism? ""When confronted with the facts that the new strain of the virus was transmitting faster we took the tough but necessary action to control the virus, protect the NHS and save lives."" Sir Keir used a press conference on Sunday morning to demand the PM apologise for cancelling Christmas - despite last week calling for tougher measures himself. The Labour leader hit out: ""This is not just one mistake when he has otherwise got things right. It is the same mistake over and over again. ""At the heart of the problem here is a Prime Minister who simply doesn't want to be unpopular and therefore won't take the tough decisions that are necessary, until he is forced into them at the 11th hour. But it was his claim that Mr Johnson ignored warnings about the mutant strain of Covid since September that enraged ministers. Matt Hancock hit back: ""As it happens this is one of the fastest decisions I've seen in government to go from the evidence of this 70% increased transmission to putting in this action."" The Health Secretary said it was a ""very difficult decision taken extraordinarily quickly."""
447,447,The Sun,Harry ColeNick Gutteridge,Brexit negotiators ignore latest deadline with trade talks to continue through the week,"WEARY British trade negotiators munched mince pies and glugged mulled wine last night amid fears they are stuck in Brussels for Christmas. Any Brexit deal is ""still days away"" the UK side warned yesterday amid continued deadlock over EU demands for SIX more years of fishing rights. Yet another breakthrough deadline was missed last night after both sides simply ignored loud warnings from the EU Parliament that a deal must be done by Sunday night or they would not rubber stamp it. A ""tortured"" weekend of talks failed to break the deadlock over ""unreasonable"" demands from the EU for a further six years of access to UK waters for their fishermen. That has been whittled down from a decade in snail paced haggling, but the UK has consistently rejected an offer from Brussels to cut their annual take by about a quarter. Britain has offered a three to four year phasing out and wants closer to 60 per cent of stock back in that time. Last night the knackered Brits were refuelled on mince pies and mulled wine served up by the UK ambassador SIr Tim Barrow as it dawned on them that talks could run through next week. ""A landing zone is there but it could take the rest of the year to get there"" one UK source said last night. Another added: ""we have made clear we can carry on talking past Christmas and wrap this up and get it through our Parliament in a day. So this has some road to go yet."". Both the EU and the UK have been distracted by Covid again as talks reach their endgame, but Lord Frost and EU counterpart Michel Barnier plan to go toe to toe on fishing numbers again on Monday. Last night Michel Barnier repeated coded hints that the EU must be able to punish Brexit Britain if they become too competitive, tweeting enigmatically: ""we should both be able to act when our interests are at stake."""
448,448,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Government hiring crack team of ex-spooks and soldiers to protect Britain’s vaccine supplies,"ELITE former intelligence officers and soldiers have been drafted to protect Britain's vaccine stocks from being stolen, The Sun can reveal. Vetted ex-officers from Army intelligence units and the security services are being sought to start working immediately on the ""National Vaccine Security Programme"" that hopes to be operational by Christmas. The unit - dubbed the V Team - has been set up by Whitehall officials amid fears the UK's world beating vaccine deployment leaves the country open to attack. Last week ministers ""wargamed"" scenarios where our vaccine stocks were raided by enemies as part of Covid resilience tests. A job advert circulated amongst former special forces and intelligence personnel says ""this is an issue of national importance so please dig deep and put your hand up if you are able to take this on."" But those offering their services are warned to ""bear in mind that this is HMG contracting, tax-payers money etc, so rates will be decent but not high."" Those that sign up must be ready to  begin work ""immediately and be prepared to work over Xmas"" and through to March and beyond. It is understood two senior officials from the Ministry of Defence have also seconded to vaccine security. Last night a Health department spokesman told The Sun: ""The COVID-19 vaccination programme is the biggest immunisation programme in the history of the NHS. ""Transporting large amounts of vaccine around the country to hundreds of vaccination sites is a complex logistical operation in partnership with multiple agencies and organisations. ""Security is an important part of that operation and officials from a range of organisations have joined the programme to assist with this vital work"""
449,449,The Sun,Harry ColeJonathan ReillyShaun WoollerAlahna Kindred,Boris Johnson to address nation today as new coronavirus lockdown and Christmas travel ban feared,"BORIS Johnson will today address the nation after summoning his Cabinet for crunch talks amid fears of a new coronavirus lockdown that is poised to ruin Christmas for millions. The PM is expected to announce his battle plan after a string of emergency talks as the bug has continued to spread - with a new strain ripping across London and the South East. Millions of families could today be told their Christmas bubble has burst - with fears of a third national lockdown. Mr Johnson could announce new travel advice today - restricting travel to and from the South East to combat the spread as well as more lockdown measures. Downing Street today confirmed the Prime Minister will host a cabinet call ""shortly"" - believed to be about 1pm. He will later hold a press conference - said to be scheduled for 4pm - with the chief medical officer Chris Whitty and the chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance. Boris last night sat down in an emergency meeting and given ""alarming"" new evidence over the new strain - as medics issued a chilling warning it is 50 per cent more contagious than previous Covid-19 cases. Professor Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said the UK has informed the World Health Organisation that the new variant coronavirus can spread more rapidly. He said while there was no evidence the new strain causes a higher mortality, urgent work was underway to investigate it. Prof Whitty said: ""Given this latest development, it is now more vital than ever that the public continue to take action in their area to reduce transmission."" Last night a government source told The Sun: ""What we do not know yet is whether the new strain is more or less likely to cause you harm, but what we have learnt is that it will pass to person to person much more easily and that is what we are really worried about."" The new strain is blamed for a sudden surge in hospitalisations and The Sun understands evidence shows a dramatic hike in positive cases in London in the past week. And there are fears people are catching the virus despite wearing PPE and socially distancing. Other potential measures could see commuters banned from travelling into the capital. A health source said: ""The last 48 hours have changed everything."" It could be weeks until it is known just how dangerous the new strain could be. A Whitehall source said: ""This is a fluid situation but it's not looking good and we have to act fast."" Boris has been trying to save Christmas, insisting Brits would be able to meet with their families thanks to the planned bubbles. Earlier yesterday Mr Johnson had urged people to start isolating immediately if they plan on celebrating with grandparents. The PM said meetings with others should be limited — as he warned a new festive spike could spark future lockdowns. He tweeted: ""If you are forming a Christmas Bubble, it's vital that from today, you minimise contact with people from outside your household. ""Everyone must take personal responsibility to avoid passing the virus on to loved ones."" As a further 4.5million people — 38million in all — wake in Tier 3 restrictions today the PM said he couldn't rule out tougher measures. Wales and Northern Ireland have already announced a post-festive shutdown. But Boris said he was ""hoping very much that we'll be able to avoid anything like that"". Speaking on a tour of a telecoms training hub in Bolton, he added: ""The reality is that infection rates have increased very much in the last few weeks."" He urged the public to avoid spreading the deadly bug over Christmas and reiterated the three household bubble was a limit, not a target people should aim for. Praising Brits, the PM said: ""I think people really get this. All the evidence I'm seeing, people understand this is the time to look after our elderly relatives and avoid spreading the disease. ""Keep it short, keep it small, have yourselves a very little Christmas as I said the other night — that is, I'm afraid, the way through this year. ""Next year I've no doubt that as we roll out the vaccine it will be very different indeed."" Stats released yesterday showed those living with Covid in England have risen by almost a fifth in a week. The ONS said 567,300 people had the bug between December 6 and 12 — equal to one person in 95. The latest reproduction R number is now between 1.1 and 1.2. But the public do appear to be listening to the PM — as official figures show only half of Brits are planning to form a festive bubble. That includes 26 per cent saying they plan to visit family and friends but not stay overnight compared with 52 per cent last year. Only four per cent plan to meet in restaurants, cafes or bars compared with 44 per cent last year. The PM is still coming under fire from Tories and hospitality chiefs, who want measures lifted as soon as possible, plus gloomy scientists who predict more lockdowns. Meanwhile, fears are growing that a more draconian Tier 4 may be needed. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is understood to be considering additional curbs if mass testing fails to make an impact. A Whitehall official said: ""There is a case for going further than Tier 3 and it is getting stronger — closure of non-essential retail, stay-at-home orders. ""That would have to be actively considered in conversation with a local authority."" Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King's College London, said people should consider postponing Christmas socialising until Easter. And Prof Neil Ferguson, whose modelling led to March's first lockdown, suggested a more severe third national lockdown may be needed. Prof John Edmunds, of the Sage science advisory body, warned: ""Unfortunately it doesn't look like the tier system is holding back the epidemic wave. We are going to have to look at these measures and perhaps tighten them."" Documents newly released by Sage say avoiding social contacts for more than five days before meeting older or vulnerable people at Christmas will reduce the risk of transmitting the virus. A longer period of a week or more would reduce the risk even further. A document dated November 26 says taking a rapid Covid test before a multi-day gathering inside a home could also reduce risk."
450,450,The Sun,Harry Cole,New Covid strain is 70 per cent more contagious as experts fear South East outbreak is racing out of control,"THE new Covid-19 variant that has ripped through the South East is 70 per cent more contagious than the original strain, Boris Johnson revealed today. The PM today revealed the ""frighteningly transmissable"" new variant was spreading rapidly - forcing him to put millions of Brits in Tier 4 lockdown for Christmas. Boris today said that the new strain meant that the R rate could be increased by 0.4 as he revealed the festive season was cancelled. Speaking at a press conference today, the PM said the strain was ""spreading very fast"". He said: ""There's still much we don't know but it is spreading more quickly. ""There is no evidence however to suggest that it's more lethal or causes more severe illness. ""Equally, there is no evidence to suggest the vaccine will be any less effective."" Click the links below to find out more... Professor Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, today said the UK has informed the World Health Organisation that the new variant coronavirus can spread more rapidly. He said: ""There is no current evidence to suggest the new strain causes a higher mortality rate or that it affects vaccines and treatments, although urgent work is under way to confirm this. ""Given this latest development, it is now more vital than ever that the public continue to take action in their area to reduce transmission."" A Health source said: ""The last 48 hours have changed everything."" It is also feared to have first emerged in London and the South East as early as September, Chief Scientific Officer Sir Patrick Vallance said at today's Downing Street briefing. The strain - called VUI202012/01 - has caused cases to double in a week in the capital as it buckles under the new variant. The weekly average case rate is also up 66 per cent in two weeks for the rest of the country as the mutant strain tears through Covid hotspots. Data from the ONS shows that the new variant accounted for 62 per cent of all cases in London on the week commencing December 9, double the 28 per cent reported on the week commencing November 18. Professor Sir Mark Walport - a member of the Government's Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) - said there was a real possibility that the new variant could have a ""transmission advantage"". He told BBC2's Newsnight: ""What happens with viruses is they do naturally mutate all the time and the ones that are likely to do well are the ones that increase transmission."" ""We know that this is a new variant, it has been seen in other countries but it seems to be quite widespread which suggests that it has got a transmission advantage. ""Scientists are working extremely hard to work out what is going on. But it does definitely seem possible that this transmits more easily. ""It will make the social-distancing even more critical."" The Sun understands new evidence shows a dramatic hike in positive cases in London over the last week. The new strain is being blamed for a sudden uptick in hospitalisations in the Capital. And there are fears that people are catching it despite wearing PPE and socially distancing, pointing again to a surge in the virus's ability to spread. Large swathes of the South East were put in Tier 3 this week after the Government's review. Scientists have found this new strain of Covid-19 spreads faster than the original strain of the virus. The new variant that has been found predominantly in Kent and neighbouring areas - but has spread as far as Scotland. The Prime Minister could announce new travel restrictions on London and Kent on Saturday after a chilling warning from medics that is poised to ruin Christmas for millions. Such action would risk ruining Christmas for millions plunged into deeper lockdown rather than allowed to meet up under the festive bubbles plan. While it is too late to change the law, Mr Johnson was on Friday night consulting with Cabinet colleagues over whether to change festive advice for begging people not to leave the Capital next week. And the commuter belt of the South East has been blighted by soaring virus numbers meaning Christmas is on the cusp of being cancelled across the Home Counties. It come as Boris Johnson today refused to rule out a third national lockdown after Christmas - and warned that the Covid infection rate was growing. The PM said he ""hoped"" that England would not have to shut down once again - after Northern Ireland joined Wales in saying it would shut down from Boxing Day onwards. Britain's R rate has risen this week as cases of the coronavirus continue to increase across the country. The current R value - the number of people an infected person will pass Covid on to - is now estimated to be between 1.1 and 1.2."
451,451,The Sun,Harry Cole,Canny Government whips set Coleen Rooney-style trap to catch leaker,"CANNY government whips set up a Coleen Rooney-style ""Wagatha Christie"" sting to catch a leaker. Tory MP Andrew Lewer, 49, was axed as a parliamentary private secretary after falling into a trap designed to nail someone who was giving information to the media. He was among several of the senior aides sent slightly differently-worded letters warning that the ministerial code ""strictly prohibits"" leaking. The one Lewer received appeared in full on a political website on Thursday. Lewer, MP for Northampton South, suggested a staff member had access to his emails. He told the Politico website: ""In nearly 20 years of elected office I have never leaked to the Press."" Chief whip Mark Spencer organised the sting after PM Boris Johnson was enraged by leaks coming from his government — especially over lockdown. No10 insiders were delighted the plan had worked. A source said: ""Leaks undermine the Government's ability to operate effectively and the chief takes a zero tolerance approach to people who should be on our team who leak letters."" It comes after Coleen, 34, suspected someone was feeding info from her Instagram to the Press — so took action. She blocked all her followers save one, and posted a series of fake stories which appeared in the media. She blamed Rebekah Vardy, 38, who denied it. She is suing Coleen. The women have agreed a stay in the proceedings to try to settle out of court."
452,452,The Sun,Harry ColeMatt DathanJonathan Reilly,Boris Johnson urges Brits to cut back on Christmas plans as Government advises meeting gran OUTSIDE,"BRITS were last night urged by boffins to cut back on Christmas plans — and meet outside if granny is joining. The crackers advice could see families eating turkey dinners out in the cold of their gardens. Covid rules will still be lifted for five days so three households can bubble up. Boris Johnson said he would not be scrapping the rules he announced last month allowing families to meet up. But he suggested they now keep celebrations small and short amid increasing concerns over a surge in Covid. Advice goes as far as to consider celebrating outdoors if granny is joining the party. It says: ""If you do form a Christmas bubble, then be especially careful to observe the guidance - meet outdoors where possible, wash your hands regularly, keep a distance from those you don't live with, and, if you meet indoors, ensure good ventilation by letting in fresh air."" It opens the door to millions of Brits having their Christmas Day dinner shivering in the garden, when temperatures are forecast to dip as low as 1C. The PM issued a warning as it emerged a snap of his Jack Russell Dilyn — draped in tinsel outside No10 — features on his Christmas card this year. He said it is ""a time of year that is of immense emotional and spiritual importance, but also a moment for us to exercise extreme caution"". Mr Johnson insisted it would be ""inhumane"" to cancel Christmas — but urged people to use ""personal responsibility"" to protect elderly and vulnerable loved ones. He added: ""A smaller Christmas is going to be a safer Christmas and a shorter Christmas is a safer Christmas. ""So, have yourselves a merry little Christmas and I'm afraid this year, I do mean little."" Mr Johnson later privately told Tory MPs the public should ""make their own minds up"" about how far to follow the tougher new guidance or original legal rules. Dr Gavin Morgan, of the Sage advisory group for emergencies,  told Times Radio  that the Government ""has made it harder really, by their confused, muddled messaging"". He added: ""We also know that if messaging is confused and unclear, then it lacks credibility. And people then just don't obey and just don't follow and end up doing what they want."" Under five days of relaxed rules, between December 23 and December 27, people will only be able to meet with a ""bubble"" inside a private home or in an open public space. The tier rules will still apply to pubs and restaurants — but even if they are still open in your area you cannot mix with your bubble there. When the Christmas period is over, all areas will return to whatever tier they were in previously — with 99 per cent of England outlawed from mixing indoors with other households. The PM issued new guidance amid mounting pressure from the devolved administrations. Last month Mr Johnson set out a ""four nations"" approach to the Christmas rules that meant people could travel across the country and meet up with two other households indoors. But yesterday, on another extraordinary day of chaos, each  of the four nations published different guidance on how people should behave over Christmas. WALES: Only two households should form a bubble over Christmas. Shops, pubs and other venues will shut ahead of a full 'Stay at Home' lockdown fromDecember 28. SCOTLAND: People should meet up in small bubbles for just one day over Christmas, and no overnight stays. People should keep windows open and not share dishes if they can. If people have not made plans, they should stay at home. People shouldn't travel to areas where there are fewer cases of the virus. Limit of 8 people in bubbles - but under 12s don't count. ENGLAND: Keep it small, with as few bubbles as possible. Keep it short, but no specific rules on length of gatherings. Think of the elderly and avoid seeing them if you can. Avoid busy Boxing Day sales and New Year parties. And isolate for five days before seeing people. NORTHERN IRELAND: Not yet clear. Medics and politicians to hold further talks. The Welsh government performed a baffling U-turn  by announcing it was even changing the law to make it illegal for more than two households to meet up over  the five-day period. Earlier in the day it had agreed to keep the law the same as the rest of the UK. First Minister Mark Drakeford also stunned the Welsh by announcing yet another lockdown that will start on December 28 and last at least three weeks. Different rules apply north of the border, with Scots told they should meet up in their three-household bubble for just one day over the five-day window. But by law they are allowed to meet up for up to five days as long as the total number of people in the Christmas bubble is no higher than eight. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon added further uncertainty by warning she may change the rules yet again. People in Northern Ireland are still waiting to hear what guidance they should follow, with medics and political leaders holding further talks today. Currently, people are allowed an extra day either side of the five-day window if they are travelling to or from the province. Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey told The Sun: ""This is a shambles by the Government — the four nations approach has completely broken down making the rules across the UK more complicated. ""Boris Johnson is advising families not to get together at Christmas because it isn't safe, but refuses to give clear guidelines in England."" He added: ""Within minutes of the Prime Minister reassuring the public that there would be no change in the laws surrounding Christmas gatherings across the UK, the Welsh First Minister confirms the law will now change in Wales."" Last night the UK, Scottish and Welsh governments  issued a joint statement insisting this ""cannot be a normal Christmas"" due to the coronavirus crisis. They called on people to think carefully about forming bubbles. Top medic Professor Chris Whitty earlier begged people not to travel too widely next week — especially from virus hotspots. The PM told a hastily organised Downing Street press conference: ""The overall situation is, alas, worse and more challenging than we'd hoped when we first set the rules. ""So while it would not be right, we think, to criminalise people who have made plans and simply want to spend time with their loved ones, we are asking you to think hard, and in detail about the days ahead, and whether you can do more to protect yourself and others while keeping the laws the same. ""When we say three households can meet in five days, I want to stress that these are maximums not targets to aim for. ""If possible don't travel from a high prevalence to a low prevalence area and avoid staying away from home overnight. ""And if you have an elderly relative, you might want to delay seeing them until they've been vaccinated. ""And whatever your plans for Christmas, please think carefully about avoiding crowds in the Boxing Day sales, and no one should be gathering in large groups to see in the New Year."" Ministers had earlier suggested people should view Easter as Christmas this time around — with weeks or months more of restrictions likely. More than 65,000 people have now died with Covid in the UK. Latest figures show that nearly two million have suffered with the virus. A further 612 deaths were recorded yesterday. Another 25,161 were diagnosed with the virus — compared to 18,450 the previous day. CLARIFICATION: This article's original headline has been changed to clarify that the Government has advised meeting - not necessarily eating - outdoors with elderly relatives at Christmas."

Ben Wallace said the sore loser President had always fought Britain's corner on the world stage. He told The Sun: ""I'll miss Donald Trump, because he was quite a good friend to Britain."" The gushing praise will raise eyebrows in Westminster where Boris Johnson has made a concerted effort to love-bomb incoming President-Elect Joe Biden. Speaking on a visit to British troops in Tapa, North Estonia Mr Wallace added: ""Whatever people think of him, Donald Trump's position towards the United Kingdom in many areas was totally aligned with us. ""And we should all be grateful or happy when we have a US administration that supports Britain's interests."" 900 Brits are posted to the base near the Russian border in a bulwark NATO operation against Moscow, who Mr Wallace accused of ""flexing its muscles."" He told The Sun ""the readiness factor here is the key."" ""All the forces here are very, very ready for anything that happens. And that is a deterrent in itself. ""If it takes you weeks or months to do something, then your adversary knows what other choices, so I think readiness speaks volumes. ""This is one of the most ready battle groups, we have in NATO and that means it's not to be underestimated."" Mr Wallace warned that the Putin regime's use of chemical weapons to try assassinate its foes such as the 2018 Salisbury attack risked ""killing thousands"" if it were to go wrong."
454,454,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",ISIS remains a threat to Britain ‘because coronavirus has allowed terrorists to regroup’,"ISLAMIC State remains a ""potent"" threat to Britain and is managing to regroup — partly due to Covid, a report says. Iraqi forces trained by the West have been hammered by the virus as they try to rid the region of the jihadi terrorists. The Ministry of Defence espionage unit warns that Russia and Iran have all but given up the counter-ISIS fight in Eastern Syria giving the berserkers a chance to regroup. The so-called Islamic State stretched across 41,000 square miles of Iraq and Syria at its 2015 peak. But despite being routed by Western backed forces through 2016 and 2017, the last remnants of the group still pose a clear threat to the UK as a recruitment banner for ""would be attackers"". ""Since November 2019, there have been four terrorist attacks in the UK, all of which are assessed to have been motivated and inspired by Islamist terrorism,"" it adds. Last month the terror threat level for the UK was raised to ""severe"" meaning another attack is ""highly likely."" The report dated October of this year and seen by The Sun warns ISIS have not ""abandoned their long-term objective of re-establishing a Caliphate"" but have ""transitioned into a clandestine insurgency"". Nonetheless the intelligence chiefs say they ""have displayed a resilience which remains a potent threat to the future stability of Iraq and Syria."" And while they are only able to carry out ""less sophisticated attacks"" they nonetheless still have ""freedom of movement permitting them to plan, prepare and facilitate attacks"" and crucially ""raise revenue"" for nefarious activity as far away Western Africa, Egypt and South East Asia. And it ""still maintains a global network of affiliates and branches, to which it provides high-level strategic guidance and media and financial support."" But efforts to clamp down this year have been hit by the Covid pandemic according to a summary version of the Regional Threat Outlook prepared at the request of ministers. The report reads: ""The Iraqi Security Forces have proven themselves effective, but, in common with many other armed forces, are circumscribed by Covid-19."""
455,455,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor","Navy WILL be sent to defend UK fishing boats in No Deal Brexit if French blockade Channel, Defence Sec vows","BREXIT fishing tensions exploded today after the Defence Secretary vowed to use the full might of the Navy to protect British boats ""going about their lawful business"". Ben Wallace warned Britain was ready for ""whatever is the challenge on 1 January"" after French fishermen vowed to blockade the Channel if there is No Deal. And they said Britain's threat to send gunboats in to repel foreign vessels ""would mean that we are negotiating things that relate to war"". He hit out: ""When it comes to a Brexit deal whatever that is, it is no secret that we would use our military to help support in logistics or anything else as required by other departments - we only do things at the request of civilians. If they ask for help we will give it."" Speaking on a visit to Estonia, Mr Wallace added that the government is ""incredibly prepared"" for a no deal and ""because resilience is our second nature"" he had ordered his department to prepare for worst case scenarios - including tension in the channel. His comments came after furious French trawlermen said they will respond to being shut out of UK waters if talks collapse by stopping ferries carrying vital goods from entering ports. And they raged at an ""unimaginable"" talk of Navy gunboats being deployed to repel foreign vessels as ""meaning we're negotiating things that relate to war"". Normandy fisheries committee boss Dimitri Rogoff said: ""If we are deprived of our fishing grounds, we will not watch the British supply the French market. ""There will therefore be blockages to ferries, since this mainly happens by ferries. And on that, we are quite clear and determined."" But Mr Wallace hit back: ""Whatever happens in the negotiations people should respect each other's sovereign waters and follow the rule of law and behave peacefully and in line with it."" And he insisted he was not making a threat but just protecting UK shores ""like any other European seaborne nation"". ""We will be there to make sure we protect our fisherman because they have the right to be protected as they go about their lawful business,"" he added. The spat came as Michel Barnier told EU ambassadors No 10 has doubled down on fishing and is ""backtracking"" on possible compromises. But he said if the two sides can overcome their differences on the issue a pact can be struck in the next few days. Germany and France were also at loggerheads once more over how long negotiations should continue. Berlin said they should go on for ""as long as an agreement is possible"" but Paris insisted it will be ""very difficult to go beyond the end of the week"". Mr Wallace was speaking in Tallinn, Estonia on a visit to the 900 British troops stationed in the tiny Baltic state. His Estonian counterpart said he was ""optimistic"" about a trade deal, but Brexit would do nothing to weaken his country's strong anti-Russian defence alliance with the UK. Defence Minister Jüri Luik added:  ""while the UK is leaving the EU you are most certainly not leaving Europe. ""And the presence of the British troops here is perhaps the best testament of that - something that is very clear and unambiguous and very correct."" On a deal he added: I certainly hope there will be a good solution - so I am optimistic… I have high hopes."""
456,456,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha ClarkNick Gutteridge,Boris Johnson tells the nation to prepare for a No Deal Brexit after EU’s outrageous dinner demands,"NO DEAL is now the most likely outcome of Brexit trade talks as Brussels wants to keep the UK as its twin, Boris Johnson warned last night. The PM summoned his Cabinet to a bleak conference call, telling them outrageous EU demands were pushing negotiations to the brink. Now is the time for the public and businesses to get ready for the Australian option on January 1st. pic. twitter. com/lLJfmIy9XI Updating them on Wednesday's Brussels dinner with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Mr Johnson said that a last-minute rehash of EU demands to punish Brexit Britain for undercutting it had soured hopes of a deal. He shared an anecdote with his colleagues that the EU had told him they saw the future relationship with the UK as like twins. The PM said: ""So if the EU decides to have a haircut then the UK is going to have a haircut or else face punishment. ""Or if the EU decides to buy an expensive handbag then the UK has to buy an expensive handbag, too, or else face tariffs. ""Clearly that is not the sensible way to proceed."" Mr Johnson is also understood to be miffed that the two or three ideas he took to Brussels to try to break the deadlock were all but ignored by the EU side. One Cabinet source said: ""There was a landing zone in sight but Brussels blew it up by bringing back zombie demands to unilaterally slap taxes on UK exports off their own back if they do not like what we do. ""The PM said it was outrageous and no one disagreed."" The Sun understands there was no dissent on his warning that Britain most likely faced the hardest possible Brexit on January 1. The PM said: ""I will go to Brussels, I will go to Paris, I will go to Berlin, I will go to wherever to try to get a deal. ""But looking at where we are, I do think it's vital that everyone now gets ready for that Australian option."" The PM insists on referring to a No Deal with tariffs slapped on imports and exports as an Australia-style deal as Oz currently does not have an EU trade deal. But it glosses over the short-term economic hit and the potential for months of border chaos brought by new checks and taxes on goods. Ex-minister Simon Clarke said: ""The Prime Minister is absolutely right to hold the line as he is doing. ""We have not come so far towards regaining independence only to fall at the final furlong."" Last night, Brussels demanded a year's fishing in UK waters in a No Deal scenario and offered not to ground UK flights for six months if talks collapsed. Eurocrats offered measures to cushion the blow to aviation and road haulage. But they said in return Britain must agree to mirror EU rules in those areas — the demand that has torpedoed progress in the talks. EQUIVALENCE/EU RULES: Boris said tonight that the UK would have to follow whatever new laws Brussels brings in, or face punishments, sanctions or tariffs. This is something he says would tie Britain to the EU's orbit for years to come - and he couldn't accept. FISH: The PM claimed the deal would mean we still wouldn't have control of our waters when we leave. Boris has long promised freedom for fisherman - and is trying to strike a deal to give them some access but us in control."
457,457,The Sun,Harry ColeNick GutteridgeSascha O'SullivanNatasha Clark,Four days to save Brexit deal after Boris Johnson’s ‘lively’ fish supper with EU boss – but ‘very large’ gaps remain,"BREXIT talks are back on today after Boris Johnson and Brussels agreed to keep talking until Sunday. After a three-hour fish supper with the EU boss Ursula von der Leyen, Mr Johnson flew back to London last night with both leaders cautiously backing a fresh round of haggling. Negotiators had insisted that they could go no further without concessions from the leaders, sparking speculation one side has now blinked. No10 said the dinner was ""frank"" while the EU said it was ""lively and interesting."" But both sides ordered their teams back round the table after unlocking the standoff over a symbolic three-course meal of scallops and turbot. Fishing access is one of the major sticking points to a new trade deal that must be inked and approved by MPs by New Year in order to avoid No Deal chaos. The pair will decide on Sunday whether to carry on talking more or officially call time on the testy talks that were deadlocked over demands that Mr Johnson had said no PM could agree. Last night a Number 10 source said: ""Very large gaps remain between the two sides and it is still unclear whether these can be bridged. The PM does not want to leave any route to a possible deal untested."" They added ""by Sunday a firm decision should be taken about the future of the talks."" But EU sources sounded more optimistic, with one official close to the talks insisting that while ""the gaps between the sides are real both believe a deal can be done."" Ms von de Leyen said: ""We gained a clear understanding of each others´ positions. They remain far apart. ""We agreed that the teams should immediately reconvene to try to resolve these essential issues. We will come to a decision by the end of the weekend."" By Harry Cole, Political Editor WHEN is a deadline not a deadline? When it is Brexit talks. With another ""make or break"" cut off point kippered, Boris Johnson and his EU counterpart Ursula von de Leyen last night set yet another date of this Sunday to clinch a trade deal. Brussels said ""the end of the weekend"" was the finale, but the Brits said a decision about more talking will be taken then - so expect that deadline to slip too. But given both sides had said last night's dinner was needed because the negotiators had run out of road without someone changing their position, there is only one question Brexit-watcher's lips this morning... Who blinked first? The leaders and their chief negotiators finally met face to face after a series of frantic phone calls had failed to unlock the warring officials  - with talks proceeding beyond 11pm. A trade deal has to be inked and passed by Westminster and Brussels Parliaments by 31 December to avoid tariffs slapped on goods. The mood was boosted after Britain said it was prepared to offer EU boats ""very generous"" access to UK waters from next year and Mr Johnson dropped his threat to break international law by ripping up last year's divorce terms in a row over the Northern Irish border. Ahead of his dash to the Belgian capital, Mr Johnson had told MPs he would not be backing down over the dinner and accused the EU of making outrageous demands to bind in the UK forever. He told the Commons that talks were still stalled on EU access to British waters and their demands for a ""level playing field"" on red tape and state subsidies. Negotiators have also so far failed to agree how disputes over the new trade deal would be mediated after the UK refused to bow down to EU judges. But the PM said Brussel's solutions were never going to fly. He told MPs: ""Our friends in the EU are currently insisting that if they pass a new law in the future with which we in this country do not comply or don't follow suit, then they want the automatic right to punish us and to retaliate. ""Secondly, they are saying that the UK should be the only country in the world not to have sovereign control over its fishing waters. ""I don't believe that those are terms that any prime minister of this country should accept."" Mr Johnson's rallying cry came after Michael Gove suggested that the PM would have to climbdown to get a deal. The powerful Cabinet Office boss was said to have ""irritated"" Downing Street by publicly declaring both Mr Johnson and the EU will have ""to move"" if talks are to restart. The powerful minister raised alarm bells amongst Brexiteers by saying ""both sides"" would have to climb down to avoid a no deal. Ahead of last night's dinner Eurocrats said they were ""hoping for miracles"" and that German Ms von der Leyen can ""use all the charm available to her to woo"" Mr Johnson into ""changing some of his positions"". But early signs of that charm were in short supply when the stern German former Defence Minister chided Mr Johnson for appearing to break Covid rules by standing too close to her. Posing for photographs on his arrival at the EU HQ, Ms von der Leyen warned through an EU flag mask: ""keep distance"". Mr Johnson, who was wearing a No10 branded face covering, replied: ""You run a tight ship here, Ursula, and quite right too."" After a brief exchange for the cameras, Ms von der Leyen said ""Allons-y"", the French term for ""let's go"" as they headed off for dinner. ""Allons-y,"" the PM replied. In a sign of hardening attitudes across the Continent, the EU announced new No Deal plans just as the PM arrived in a freezing and blustery Brussels. Hopes for a breakthrough from the meeting were low on Wednesday , with European negotiators saying an agreement to carry on talks would represent a success. A French official warned: ""Things haven't really progressed since the weekend. The likelihood of No Deal is growing."" Before the meal one senior EU diplomat said they were hoping the PM would ""bring some energised movement in the UK position"". A second top diplomat insisted it was ""up to the UK now to make a move"" and every day that passes ""the more the scales tip"" towards No Deal. Ireland's PM Micheal Martin warned ahead of the meeting that the talks are on the precipice of a No Deal"". His deputy, Leo Varadkar, put the chances of a success at 50/50 but said he believes Mr Johnson will compromise to get an agreement. LEVEL PLAYING FIELD: Brussels wants a shared set of rules and standards to ensure businesses in the UK do not have an unfair advantage over their competitors. The UK has said it won't lower its standards, but wants to be able to set its own rules. GOVERNANCE: Who decides what happens if the terms of the deal are breached? The EU wants a European body to decide the terms, but the UK aren't keen on this and want an independent arbitrator to have the final say. FISHING: The EU wants continued access to Britain's fishing waters after we leave. It's claimed Britain would be happy with a three year deal to phase out access, but the EU are pushing for ten. One of the key referendum claims was that Britain would be able to take back control of our borders - including fish - when we leave the EU. And Angela Merkel hit out  ""If there are conditions coming from the British side we cannot accept, we'll go our own way without an exit agreement."" But hitting back from the tarmac of Brussels airport last night, Mr Johnson tweeted: ""A good deal is still there to be done. ""But whether we agree to trading arrangements resembling those of Australia or Canada, the United Kingdom will prosper mightily as an independent nation."""

Boris Johnson is on his way to Brussels for dinner tonight to try and rescue a Brexit deal as he hinted discussions could go through the festive season. Mr Johnson vowed to push talks ""to the wire"" yesterday, as he prepares to meet EU commission chief Ursula von der Leyen this evening. But he admitted getting a deal done after Christmas would be ""tricky"". Any deal will need to be signed and backed by both Westminster and the EU Parliament before December 31, sparking fears of weeks of festive back and forth. Stef Blok, the foreign minister for the Netherlands, said yesterday the talks should carry on up to the last minute. He stressed: ""We shouldn't be rushed into compromises. We actually have a lot of time remaining. We should use the time till 31 December."" And Spain's foreign minister Arancha González Laya said Mr Barnier should keep working ""until the last moment"". The European Commission has dismissed calls for a cut off point. They said yesterday: ""We are not going to speculate on a last-chance date. We are fully committed to substantial negotiations. We've always said and continue to say it's the substance that prevails over timing."" Downing Street has also refused to specifiy an end date, with a spokesperson saying they could carry on ""as long as we have time available"". They said earlier this week: ""Time is obviously in very short supply and we're in the final stages, but we're prepared to negotiate for as long as we have time available if we think an agreement is still possible."" The PM said issues such as control over fish in British waters - which French President Emmanuel Macron is threatening to blow up a potential deal over - are looking ""very, very difficult"" to work through. He said him and his negotiating team are ""will do their level best"". ""The UK Government's position is we're willing to engage at any level, whether political or otherwise, we're willing to try anything. ""But there are limits, beyond which obviously, any independent Government or country could go."" Cabinet office minister Michael Gove said the PM's dinner with Ms von der Leyen was a chance to ""thrash out"" a final deal. He stressed that there will need to be a ""degree of movement"" from the bloc's hardline stance on sticking points such as fishing rights, state backed subsidies for businesses and regulatory alignment with the EU. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Gove said this morning: '""It is often around the table, when you have two political principals one-on-one, that you can often find a way through."" But in-fighting amongst EU chiefs broke out last night over how far to move to get a deal with Britain. Brussels sources said EU negotiator Michel Barnier and Ms von der Leyen are in a power struggle over the negotiations ahead of the Brussels meeting. There are fears from other European leaders that Ms von der Leyen, who is close to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, will go soft in an attempt to seal a final deal. Ms Merkel insisted today she still saw a ""chance"" for a deal, but warned it would not be on terms ""unacceptable"" to the bloc. She warned any agreement ""must not endanger the integrity of the common market"", referring to the fault lines between negotiators over a so-called ""level playing field"", which would tie Britain to EU rules. However Mr Barnier warned EU foreign ministers last night that a no deal Brexit is more likely. Yesterday Britain's chief negotiator David Frost and Mr Barnier drew up a list of outstanding areas of disagreement over fishing, red tape and state backed subsidies for businesses. But one cabinet minister told The Sun the stark list would help Brussels force the PM to make ""a number of unpleasant choices"" in order to keep the flagging talks alive and avoid No Deal chaos. LEVEL PLAYING FIELD: Brussels wants a shared set rules and standards to ensure businesses in the UK do not have an unfair advantage over their competitors. The UK has said it won't lower its standards, but wants to be able to set its own rules. GOVERNANCE: Who decides what happens if the terms of the deal are breached? The EU wants an European body to decide the terms, but the UK aren't keen on this and want an independent arbitrator to have the final say. FISHING: The EU wants continued access to Britain's fishing waters after we leave. It's claimed Britain would be happy with a three year deal to phase out access, but the EU are pushing for ten. One of the key referendum claims was that Britain would be able to take back control of our borders - including fish - when we leave the EU. And Mr Johnson's colleagues were worried Ms von der Leyen would serve up a grim ""menu of climb downs"" if he wanted to keep talks going. The PM warned he was already at the ""limit"" on what he could accept as a Brexit deal and could yet ""draw stumps' if there is no progress tonight. ""Our friends have just got to understand the UK has left the EU in order to be able to exercise democratic control over the way we do things,"" he added. ""There is also the issue of fisheries where we are still a long way apart still. But hope springs eternal, I will do my best to sort it out if we can."" Last night hopes of a breakthrough were bolstered by the UK finally agreeing to drop a threat to tear up last year's divorce deal in a row over Northern Ireland. Both sides backed down on a bizarre row over blocking imports and exports of cold meat between Ireland and Northern Ireland dubbed the ""banger war"". Brussels also dropped demands for an EU Embassy in Belfast forever to oversee Euro officials who will be allowed to roam Ulster making sure rules are kept. Mr Gove last night branded Maroš Šefčovič  ""the sausage king of Brussels"" as they shook on tied up loose ends from last years deal."

Colleagues fear the Prime Minister will be served up a grim ""menu of climb downs"" by EU boss Ursula von der Leyen if he wants to kickstart deadlocked talks. Yesterday, Mr Johnson vowed to push talks ""to the wire"" - hinting they could still be going at Christmas but admitted it would be ""tricky."" And a public spat broke out between EU chiefs about how long the negotiations could go. Any deal must be signed and backed by both Westminster and the EU Parliament before 31 December, sparking fears of weeks of festive back and forth. On Tuesday Britain's chief negotiator David Frost and his EU counterpart Michel Barnier drew up a list of outstanding areas of disagreement over fishing, red tape and state backed subsidies for businesses. But one cabinet minister told The Sun the stark list would help Brussels force the PM to make ""a number of unpleasant choices"" in order to keep the flagging talks alive and avoid No Deal chaos.

Micheal Gove last night branded Maroš Šefčovič ""the sausage king of Brussels"" as they shook on tied up loose ends from last year's exit deal. Meanwhile sources say a rift has opened up between two key EU chiefs over how far to move to get a deal with Britain. Top negotiator Barnier and von der Leyen are embroiled in a power struggle for control of the negotiations. Internal splits have emerged within the bloc over how to approach the Brexit endgame. Mrs von der Leyen, who is close to German leader Angela Merkel, has been taking an increasingly hands-on role in the talks. But some Member States fear she's going too soft on Britain and are trying to bolster Mr Barnier's position as their main man."
460,460,The Sun,Harry ColeNick GutteridgeNatasha Clark,Brexit: Boris Johnson to jet to Brussels to save Brexit talks after ‘Michel Barnier ambush’,"BORIS Johnson will jet to Brussels ""in the coming days"" in one last ditch bid to get a Brexit trade deal over the line. The Prime Minister's offer to dash across the Channel came after a ""difficult"" forty minute call with EU boss Ursula von der Leyen where both sides admitted their negotiation teams had reached the ""end of the road."" With @BorisJohnson we took stock of the negotiations. The conditions for an agreement are not there due to remaining differences on critical issues.  We asked our Chief Negotiators to prepare an overview of the remaining differences to be discussed in person in the coming days. pic. twitter. com/rWCWlMz0dv Last night insiders described the call as ""difficult at times"" but insisted it remained ""perfectly courteous"" despite gaping differences remaining between the two sides. A senior Government source claimed there had been no movement at all since Friday in the testy standoff over fishing waters and binding Britain to EU red tape forever. Sources said the call was ""polite but firm"" but clear the PM and Ms von der Leyen were ""miles apart still on real make or break stuff"". The two side's senior negotiators were unable to forge a deal that was acceptable to Mr Johnson's clear red lines and any hope of a breakthrough was now only at a leader's level. A senior Government source said: ""Whilst we do not consider this process to be closed, things are looking very tricky and there's every chance we are not going to get there."" Mr Johnson ""cannot and will not accept the current terms"" according to one insider as talks face the prospect of lasting another week. ""Anyone that thinks this is going to be some turn up and sign at that moment will be disappointed,"" another gloomy official involved said. Mr Johnson could travel to Brussels as soon as tomorrow ahead of a meeting of the other EU 27 countries in the Belgian capital scheduled for Thursday. The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier had said on Monday that he would not allow the talks to continue past Wednesday, but there are some in London that think it could be days more before a deal is forged. But the Daily Mail reports Mr Barnier had already ambushed the UK by re-tabling old demands for the UK to respect all laws the EU might pass in the future. The move would effectively bind Britain to EU laws, under the threat of huge tariffs if they were broken. The two sides are now expected to draw up a list of the remaining differences between them ahead of the PM travelling to Brussels. Some close to Mr Johnson say a breakthrough could still be a week away given the differences between the two sides and he may not travel to the continent until the weekend. A Whitehall source said: ""There's no real reason this can't happen next week. ""The talks need a political injection and we should not be bound by time constraints on when that is. We need it to work so it should come at the right time."" Countless self-imposed deadlines for a deal have now been missed, but both sides must ratify the new trading arrangements before 1 January 2021 or face border chaos and the economic blow of a No Deal. After a ""working dinner"" of burgers for the two sides in Brussels on Sunday night, talks went late into the night. But both sides conceded that Brit chief negotiator David Frost and his Brussels counterpart were ""going round in circles"" by Monday afternoon. Hopes of a deal had briefly soared when Downing Street confirmed they were willing to drop contentious plans to break international law by ripping up some parts of last year's divorce deal with Brussels if talks collapsed. But the controversial Internal Market Bill that would give ministers the power to override the terms of last year's ""oven ready"" Withdrawal Agreement may now be watered down in a move that was seen as a big olive branch to the EU. Brussels had been infuriated by the threat, but some ministers had privately admitted it was merely a hardball negotiating tactic Earlier in the day Ms von de Leyen had spoken with Angela Merkel and Emmanual Macron. There is continued anger on the British side towards the French President who many blame for last minute toughening up of EU demands. Meanwhile gloomy EU diplomats instead blame an 11th hour demand from the UK on fishing for slowing down progress. One told The Sun: ""These are going to be decisive hours for the future of UK-EU relations and we're at the make it or break it moment."" EU sources said Mr Barnier had briefed member states on Monday morning that ""we are not far from the very endgame, but we cannot go further than Wednesday. ""I can't guarantee we will reach an agreement tonight, we might still have to negotiate tomorrow"", he added. Last night the two leaders said: ""As agreed on Saturday, we took stock today of the ongoing negotiations. We agreed that the conditions for finalising an agreement are not there due to the remaining significant differences on three critical issues: level playing field, governance and fisheries. LEVEL PLAYING FIELD: Brussels wants a shared set rules and standards to ensure businesses in the UK do not have an unfair advantage over their competitors. The UK has said it won't lower its standards, but wants to be able to set its own rules. GOVERNANCE: Who decides what happens if the terms of the deal are breached?

461,461,The Sun,Harry ColeNick Gutteridge,Britain deliberately broke away from European Medicines Agency in bid to approve Covid vaccine faster,"BRITAIN deliberately broke away from the European Medicines Agency control for vaccine approval in October - meaning the UK could rubber stamp the jab quicker. Any EU member could in theory do this, but Brussels ordered the 27 remaining EU countries to form a united vaccine policy and wait for central approval. Yesterday Germany acknowledged that this diktat has meant a slower rollout of the virus fighter. Their health minister Jens Spahn said:  ""What we opted for was a common European approach to move forward together."" Matt Hancock told Times Radio because of this ""We've been able to make a decision to do this based on the UK regulator, a world-class regulator, and not go at the pace of the Europeans, who are moving a little bit more slowly."" EU Covid efforts have also been hampered by hurried stripping of London of the HQ of the EU Medicines Agency in the wake of the 2016's historic referendum. The EMA admitted two months ago it still hasn't got back up to full capacity following a difficult relocation to Amsterdam in the wake of Brexit. And he said the agency was having ""major difficulties"" coping with the pandemic due to loss of staff and budget constraints. There has been fury that the move seen by many to punish Britain for Brexit has actually hampered the EU's Covid response. German MEP Gunnar Beck said: ""The response by the EU to the Coronavirus crisis has been slow, expensive, and badly managed. ""There was no rush to move the EMA out of London. In doing so as quickly as possible, they've tied one arm behind their back. ""Instead they chose to cut off their nose to spite their face and put people at risk."""
462,462,The Sun,Harry Cole,"Red wall voters will not forgive Boris Johnson if he sells out to get a trade deal with Brussels, polls show","RED wall voters will not forgive Boris Johnson if he sells out for a trade deal with Brussels, damning polling shows. More than half of voters in 34 North and Midlands seats won by the Tories in 2019 will be less likely to vote for the PM if he does. They do not want him to betray his pledge to take back control of UK fishing waters. And 58 per cent of those voters said they would be less likely to return Mr Johnson to No10 for another term if EU judges continue to have control over British laws. The ability for Britain to forge our own free trade deals around the world was also a major condition for Conservative support for 55 per cent. The Centre For Brexit Policy who commissioned the poll said: ""On the supremacy of the British Parliament, swing voters living in key battleground areas in the North that gave the PM his majority are adamant there must be no backsliding."" The figures, based on a Savanta ComRes sample of over 2,000 people, will be a wake-up call for many Conservative MPs elected in traditionally Labour heartlands on narrow majorities. WE understand the Government's desire to get a Brexit deal over the line quickly: frictionless free trade with the EU would make life much easier for everyone. But it's absolutely crucial that Boris stands firm on fishing. It goes right to the heart of why Brits voted for Brexit — and as a new Savanta ComRes poll shows, Blue Wall Tories will never forgive the PM if his ""red lines"" start turning pink. Boris and his negotiators have been admirably consistent from the start: a deal that is compatible with our newly won sovereignty is the only one that Britain can accept. There must be no backsliding now. They will be lifted by Mr Johnson's vow not to climb down as talks enter the home straight. Hopes of a breakthrough this week were fading yesterday after France threatened to upend the negotiations. The PM said he was ""absolutely committed"" to a deal but not at any price. He added: ""It's about making sure that the UK is able to run its own laws, its own fisheries and so on. That fundamentally is what it's all about."""

466,466,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha ClarkKate FergusonJonathan Reilly and Matt Dathan,Drinkers’ delight as they’re told they can booze in pub if they buy Scotch egg,"DELIGHTED drinkers were told last night they can booze in Tier 2 pubs — if they buy a Scotch egg. Bars must offer a ""substantial meal"" to reopen under new Covid curbs in England from tomorrow. Environment Secretary George Eustice, whose family farm makes the picnic favourite, said: ""I think a Scotch egg probably would count."" It came as under-fire Boris Johnson offered pubs that cannot reopen in England's Tier 2 or Tier 3 a one-off Christmas gift of around £1,000. Bosses in the crippled industry labelled the PM ""stingier than Scrooge"". A hundred Tory MPs threatened to vote down the new tier rules tonight — with Labour piling the pressure on the PM by abstaining. The British Meat Processors Association backed Mr Eustice, saying: ""The minister is quite right, a Scotch egg makes a cracking meal alongside a pint of beer"". Boss Nick Allen added: ""It's a good bit of news for once and most welcome for pork producers across the land."" Last night, the PM's spokesman refused to draw a line between a snack and a meal. Small snacks such as a packet of crisps or pork scratchings are definitely out. But pressed on whether the rules permit pints being served alongside sausage rolls, pork pies or a sandwich, he said: ""I'm obviously not going to get into the detail of every possible meal."" Previously, ministers stated a Cornish pasty might count if served with chips or salad. Pub landlords say they still face financial ruin from the return to the tiered system tomorrow that will see 30,000 boozers unable to reopen. Paul Bristow, Tory MP for Peterborough, said: ""What pubs need is the substantial meal rule reversed. They don't want handouts, they want the ability to trade. ""Covid does not go away just because you have a bowl of chips in front of you."" Mr Johnson is battling the biggest Tory rebellion of his premiership when MPs vote on the new measures tonight with at least 75 demanding changes to the system. He offered the £1,000 gift in a bid to quell the fury. Labour will lay bare Tory divisions by abstaining in tonight's crunch votes on the new regional system. The Government is still expected to win but Labour's refusal to vote in favour is a further humiliation for the PM as it will expose the huge scale of the Tory rebellion. Explaining why he is ordering his MPs to abstain, leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""We will always act in the national interest, so we will not vote against these restrictions in Parliament tomorrow. ""However, I remain deeply concerned that Boris Johnson's government has failed to use this latest lockdown to put a credible health and economic plan in place. ""We still don't have a functioning testing system, public health messaging is confused, and businesses across the country are crying out for more effective economic support to get them through the winter months. ""It is short-term government incompetence that is causing long-term damage to the British economy."" Last night, furious landlords who had begged No10 to stump up between £3,000 and £12,000 a month extra for pubs hammered by the new lockdown branded the one-off £1,000 an ""insult"". James Davis, who runs the Cock Inn at Brent Eleigh, Suffolk, said the offer was ""too little too late"" for a sector that had already seen its festive trade smashed. Mr Davis, who will remain closed in Tier 2, said: ""Every pub needs help. They are the fabric of Britain but we're treating them like a cheap suit."" British Beer and Pub Association chief Emma McClarkin said: ""A so-called Christmas bonus is simply nowhere near enough to bridge the gap on their ongoing costs let alone lost revenue."" In a separate bid to win over MPs, ministers also published a long awaited ""impact assessment"" on what effect the new lockdown measures will have. It acknowledged the ""knock-on implications"" of restrictions on other health services, mental health and physical wellbeing as well as the economic impact, but failed to win over many furious Tory MPs. Unemployment faces being higher than the 2.6 million predicted last week and the economic hit will be greater. ENVIRONMENT Secretary George Eustice's family farm shop sells Scotch eggs and pork pies. The shop, called Trevaskis, near Camborne, Cornwall, also sells sausage rolls, fruit and veg. Mr Eustice's dad Paul started growing his own fruit in the early 1980s before later expanding the business to include a tea room and a restaurant. But despite the damage caused by the tiers, it says allowing the disease to run unchecked will be ""much worse"" for public health. However, it claimed it was impossible to predict the long-term effect — despite reports Boris had vetoed putting London into Tier 3 after being shown evidence it would hit half a million jobs. Senior Tories claimed the document ""collapsed under the glare of scrutiny"". THREE cheers for the brave Tory rebels fighting tooth and nail to make the Tiers system fairer. They've done well to force the PM into adding a sunset clause: such draconian restrictions on our cherished liberties MUST be given regular and robust parliamentary scrutiny — that's how a healthy democracy works. And they are right, too, to demand published analysis of the health, economic and social ramifications of the measures taken to suppress Covid-19. Every other piece of life-altering legislation which passes through Parliament comes with an economic impact assessment.  And everything done in the healthcare system through NICE comes with a health impact assessment, proving the treatment   proposed will save enough years of healthy life to justify the cost. Why on earth should Covid-related decisions be treated any differently? If Boris can prove to the satisfaction of MPs that putting 99 per cent of the country back into semi-lockdown is a sensible, necessary and proportionate precaution — fine. But with the drumbeat of retail job losses on the high street and in the hospitality sector getting louder by the day, it's only right that our elected representatives are clear on EXACTLY what they're signing up to — and why."
467,467,The Sun,Harry ColeKate Ferguson,Strict Covid tiers system won’t be lifted ‘until Easter Monday’ in bid to protect NHS,"EASTER Monday has been pencilled in for the lifting of strict Covid tiers, The Sun can reveal. Boris Johnson hopes coronavirus cases will have tailed off by April 5. The news dashes hopes that new vaccines will lead to a swifter end to the crisis — and it will further enrage Tory MPs already threatening mutiny when tough measures are voted on next week. It will also reignite calls for more financial support for crippled pubs and restaurants. But the PM is determined to put the NHS first — and believes he will have to wait until after Covid's winter peak in February and March to ease his grip. A senior government source told The Sun: ""Boris will not countenance hospitals overflowing like they did in Italy. ""Nor can we get to the stage where we have to cancel operations and treatments. In all likelihood, the tiers have to stay."" Yesterday, Mr Johnson tried to reassure people their areas could be moved into lower tiers if and when infection rates fall. Seeing how Covid testing is going on in Porton Down, Wiltshire, he said: ""I know it is frustrating for people when they are in a high-tier area when there is very little incidence in their village or their area. ""There really is the prospect of areas being able to move down the tiering scale."" A government source added that ""as a vaccine is rolled out and testing is ramped up, more and more areas will come down in their tiers"". New data shows the key ""R"" rate has dropped below 1 for the first time since August. Science advisers Sage estimate it is now between 0.9 and 1 across the UK — meaning infections are on the wane. But Whitehall insiders reckon it is inevitable it will tick up again over Christmas as families make the most of seeing friends and relatives in their festive bubbles. That in turn could see much of England in the strictest Tier 3 lockdown in the New Year — while it is very unlikely any areas will go into Tier 1 over the same period. Some scientists even believe rates could rocket so quickly that another national lockdown will be needed in January. The gloomy warnings are set to spark fresh uproar among some Conservative MPs. Up to 70 are threatening to rebel and vote against the latest measures in Parliament. That would leave Mr Johnson humiliated and forced to rely on Labour backing to get his tiers plan through the Commons. Last night, one seething Tory told The Sun that Mr Johnson could be heading for the biggest rebellion of his premiership — and that even more trouble could loom. Another said: ""If it is a big rebellion then Boris is in trouble. ""It is a bit like having affairs — once you have voted against the Government once, it is easier to carry on doing it."" They are furious that ministers have ordered entire regions into tiers together, lumping Covid-free villages in with hotspots just because they fall under the same council. The MPs are begging No10 to adopt a more local approach to stop businesses being unfairly crippled by the harsh measures. Sir Graham Brady, head of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tories, said he is ready to vote against planned action. The MP, whose constituency in Greater Manchester has spent eight months in various lockdowns, said people are ""livid"". He added: ""There has been a huge amount of pain for businesses and jobs. ""People went along with a second national lockdown. But they thought there was a contract there — that by accepting that additional pain and sacrifice, they would come out into something much better. That hasn't happened."" Former Tory Cabinet minister Damian Green said the public will refuse to stick to the new rules if they think they are a sham. He added: ""My real fear is that if people think these rules have been applied unfairly in their area then there is a big chance they will start to disobey them. ""In Kent, we have a town called Tenterden which has a Covid rate of pretty much zero. ""There have been weeks when there has been literally nothing there. Yet all of Kent is in Tier 3."" He went on: ""There is a lot of anger. My email inbox has not been this full since the Dominic Cummings lockdown row."" Some Tories say that health bosses have been trying to spook them into backing next Tuesday's vote by bombarding them with ""ghoulish"" charts showing Covid hospitalisation rates remaining stubbornly high. On Monday, Tory MPs in Kent will meet with Health Secretary Matt Hancock to demand he change the way England is being carved up. And Tan Dhesi, Labour MP for Slough — the only part of Berkshire to be placed in Tier 3 — warned that locals will just end up travelling to other parts of the county to have a pint. IT is a bleak, bleak prospect. Tiers till April. A bitter blow after all the optimism that the vaccines might end this waking nightmare early in the New Year. The Sun could rail against it. We could point out that the second wave is unarguably in retreat. That the ""R"" rate nationally is below one. That infections have been falling steadily for a fortnight and that deaths and hospitalisations will inevitably soon follow. That pubs and restaurants will rapidly fold now in a tsunami of lost jobs. That restrictions are in some cases unfairly allocated — and taking a terrible toll on Britain's physical and mental health as well as our economy. But it cuts little ice in Downing Street. Nothing trumps the fear there that, if we relax, the NHS will end up overwhelmed by Covid casualties by March. That doctors will be forced, agonisingly, to choose who lives and who dies. So we make these appeals to the Prime Minister: First, show the public and your own enraged backbenchers hard evidence, both of this threat to the NHS and that tiers will do more good than harm. Second: Review them every week and err on the side of freedom. Many places don't have the cases to merit their curbs. And those have deadly consequences too. Third, move heaven and earth to get the jabs rolled out at lightning speed. The faster the most vulnerable are vaccinated, the lower the risk to the NHS that keeps you awake at night. The public have been stoic so far. That may not last four more long months of this misery. He added: ""That's not good for transmission rates in those neighbouring authorities."" One MP has claimed Health Minister Nadine Dories had admitted that local Public Health directors were not consulted on the new beefed-up tier system. They said: ""That has angered a lot of MPs from a wide range of diverse constituencies."""
468,468,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha Clark,Boris Johnson plunges 99% of England into toughest tiers as he warns not to ‘take foot off throat of the beast’,"BORIS Johnson yesterday put all of England under the toughest two Covid tiers — apart from a lucky one per cent. Only the Isle of Wight and Cornwall, plus the Isles of Scilly, escaped strict curbs to follow national lockdown next week. The PM said: ""If we ease off now, we risk losing control of this virus all over again."" He also warned against ""taking our foot off the throat of the beast"" as he unveiled his toughened-up Covid tiers. The PM plunged 55million people in England into Tiers 2 or 3 while admitting he was sorry for the ""heartache"". Mr Johnson said severe tiers were the only way to avoid a winter of hibernation and a New Year national lockdown. But he promised: ""Your tier is not your destiny."" Each will be reviewed on December 16, and weekly to the end of March. The PM said enough troops — thought to be around 14,000 — were on standby for community testing to help get virus rates down. If we ease off now, we risk losing control of this virus all over again. But Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty gave a gloomier prognosis, warning it could be months before areas escaped the toughest tiers. Only the Isle of Wight, Cornwall and Isles of Scilly landed in the lowest, Tier 1, when the month-long national lockdown ends just after midnight on Wednesday. People living there will face few restrictions and be free to mingle indoors. Some 32million people, just over 56 per cent of the English population will be in Tier 2 — including Liverpool and London. And 23million people, or 42 per cent, will be in Tier 3 including Birmingham, Manchester, Hull, swathes of the Midlands and Kent. There was fury in the Garden of England as it contains some areas with the lowest case levels in the country — but also hotspot areas such as Swale and Medway. MPs had wanted the restrictions to apply on a council basis, but whole counties and cities were slapped with the same rules. However, other areas such as Slough town centre and the rest of Berkshire were put into separate tiers — sparking claims the system was unfair. Mr Johnson faces the humiliation of relying on Labour votes to pass the latest restrictions amid a brewing Tory rebellion over how they were decided. In October 42 per cent of England was in Tier 1, a further 43 per cent in Tier 2 and just 15 per cent in Tier 3. Furious MPs claimed the PM's latest version was ""national lockdown by the back door"". They vowed to vote the new rules down when it comes to the Commons next week — unless they are given a clearer explanation of the criteria. But urging the public to ""keep an eye on the prize"" with vaccines on the way, Mr Johnson said he was convinced things will genuinely be much better by April. He promised: ""Together we can get through this winter, suppress the virus, and reclaim our lives and all the things we love."" But he warned against ""abandoning the fight yet, because we still have a long road ahead"". And he insisted areas could look forward to relaxing rules if their case numbers dropped, with his ""your tier is not your destiny"" vow. Prof Whitty struck a more cautious tone saying it could be months before some areas are returned into lower tiers, adding it would be a ""mistake to make too many judgments too early"". He added: ""In some months, possibly weeks to come, we'll be in a situation where more places could go into Tier 1. ""But we should not do that until we are confident because of the experience of Tier 1 previously. ""If you're in Tier 1 the rates start to go up, so you do not want to do that in winter just before Christmas, going into the worst time for the NHS, unless you're very confident indeed."" In some months, possibly weeks to come, we'll be in a situation where more places could go into Tier 1. Prof Whitty urged the nation to ""be sensible and don't do stupid things"" for their best shot at getting out of strict rules in the New Year. In a stark address he told the public: ""We can see an end, but the end is not now."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock echoed the warning saying: ""We cannot simply flick a switch and try to return life straight back to normal."" He added that London faces plenty of work to keep it in Tier 2 and avoid going into the next level. Tier 1: Medium alertSouth East South West Tier 2: High alertNorth West Yorkshire West Midlands East Midlands East of England London South East South West Tier 3: Very High alertNorth East North West Yorkshire and The Humber West Midlands East Midlands South East South West The Government insists it is not a full lockdown for anyone since shops, gyms and personal care businesses will reopen everywhere from next week. Admitting the hospitality industry will ""bear a disproportionate share of the burden"", Mr Johnson added: ""I really wish it were otherwise. ""But if we are to keep schools open, as we must, then our options in bearing down on the disease are necessarily limited"". Around 31,217 pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes will be hit by Tier 3 limits, according to data experts the Altus Group — meaning they can only do takeaway or delivery. Mr Johnson hailed Liverpool as a success story after mass testing there by the Army helped bring infection rates down to 162 per 100,000 people from 700 five weeks ago. The city will go from Tier 3 into Tier 2 and provide a model for others to get cases down. Mr Johnson has said that mass testing will be available to any area in Tier 3 with councils able to apply for help from next week. But his pledge was met with scepticism given 2,000 troops were needed for the Liverpool pilot. Some fear there will not be enough troops to cover the 42 per cent of the country plunged into Tier 3. The PM insisted: ""We will make sure we have adequate numbers of personnel to get it done."" THE blanket imposition of tough new tiers on places that don't merit them is a recipe for economic disaster and huge resentment. How does the Government justify to pubs or restaurants in areas with low Covid cases that they must face ruinous restrictions, or close, probably for good? The new system throws up ridiculous discrepancies and blatant injustices. No wonder MPs are in revolt. Tunbridge Wells in Kent, with a low infection rate, is in Tier 3. A neighbouring town with far higher cases is in Tier 2. There are many more. Bizarrely, infections are dropping in almost all the 119 Tier 3 areas where 20 million of us live. We do understand Boris Johnson's motive behind this new tiers system. His first last month WAS working to beat the second wave, albeit slowly, so a tougher one makes some sense. It's not quite as bad as full lockdown. And we do need hospitalisations and deaths to fall further heading into winter. But there are scores of inconsistencies which will do real damage to lives and jobs. Four in five pubs are now in peril. The PM must review the allocation of these tiers. Not in a fortnight — today. Defence sources said not all 2,000 troops in Liverpool had been needed, and that seven times that number were on standby. An MoD spokesman said: ""From next week, local authorities that fall into Tier 3 will be able to apply for support from NHS Test and Trace and the Armed Forces to deliver a six-week rapid community testing programme. This includes access to lateral flow tests and planning, logistics, funding and communications support."""
469,469,The Sun,Jonathan ReillyHarry Cole,Five Brit MPs escaped death after ‘Iranian diplomat smuggled bomb on a commercial flight’ which ‘could have started WW3’,"FIVE Brit MPs cheated death when a terror bomb plot was foiled. An Iran diplomat goes on trial today accused of smuggling explosives on a commercial flight. Agents planned to use the ""Mother of Satan"" device at a rally in Paris attended by a 35-strong British delegation. Tory MPs Bob Blackman, Matthew Offord, Sir David Amess and Theresa Villiers and Labour's Roger Godsiff were at the 2018 event. Other guests included President Donald Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani and leading US politician Newt Gingrich. Writing for The Sun today, Mr Blackman said: ""The US would undeniably have declared war on Iran — and it was only because the plot was foiled, World War Three was averted."" According to court papers, suspect spy Assadollah Assadi, 48, carried the bomb in a diplomatic bag, exempt from security searches, on an Austrian Airlines flight from Tehran to Vienna. The Mother of Satan device is the same type used in the 2015 Paris massacres and 2017 Manchester Arena bomb. Assadi, a member of Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is one of the first diplomat to face terror charges. He is on trial in Belgium alongside Amir Saadouni, 40, Amir's wife Nasimeh Naami, 36, and a fourth man. The prime target of the plot was Maryam Rajavi, the head of an exiled Iranian opposition group. Ms Villiers, who gave a speech at the conference, said: ""Sending a bomb to Europe in a diplomatic bag on a commercial flight is an outrage. ""If the court decides that is what happened it will be shocking. I feel I've had a lucky escape."" By Bob Blackman, One of the targeted MPs FOR the first time in history, an accredited diplomat is about to face trial on terrorism charges in Europe. That he represents the government of Iran is no surprise. It comes two years after Belgian authorities foiled a major terrorist plot in which an Iranian-Belgian couple had planned to set off a bomb in Paris. It was to explode at a meeting of 100,000 Iranians and hundreds of international dignitaries, including British MPs. The terrorists' vehicle contained 500 grams of a powerful explosive. Iran's Third Counselor in Vienna, Assadollah Assadi, was managing the attack, and providing the explosives. Had the plot succeeded, it would have been the deadliest terror operation ever carried out in Europe. The US would undeniably have declared war on Iran — and it was only because the plot was foiled, World War Three was averted. No normal state uses a diplomat roaming Europe with a bomb. Iran's embassies have been part of its terror operations for decades. But the UK and EU have adopted a far too conciliatory tone with Iran in recent years. The message from Brussels has been one of unconditional friendship with the ayatollahs. After three decades of soft approach, it is time to hold the Iranian regime accountable."
470,470,The Sun,Harry ColeMatt DathanNatasha ClarkJonathan Reilly,Rishi Sunak warns ‘economic emergency has just begun’ as he unveils last Covid splurge to save jobs and ‘level up’,"RISHI Sunak last night took an axe to the bloated Foreign Aid budget and handed £4billion of it to the left- behind parts of Britain. The Chancellor's levelling-up surprise delighted Red Wall Tories — yet enraged former PMs, the Church and charities who accused him of abandoning the world's needy. But a poll for The Sun shows he has massive support from the public. Mr Sunak announced the funds to be spent on projects including upgrading roads and rail in an otherwise gloomy Spending Review as he began to grapple with the worst economic hit in three centuries. Warning the Covid pain had only just begun, he revealed this year's virus bill has hit £280billion and a sluggish U-shaped recovery will take another four years. He earmarked another £55billion for the Covid battle next year, with lockdown and job support set to last until April. And he deferred punishing tax rises until next year. But in a stark update to MPs, he revealed public debt hit a peacetime record as borrowing topped £394billion this year. Mr Sunak faces a huge struggle to balance the books after an 11.3 per cent hit to GDP in 2020. The Chancellor said: ""Our health emergency is not yet over. And our economic emergency has only just begun. This situation is clearly unsustainable over the medium term."" And he began cutting the cloth by freezing the pay of 1.3 million public sector workers for next year. By Matt Dathan RISHI Sunak's extension of the furlough scheme until March will save 300,000 jobs, according to the Government's budget watchdog. But the end of the year-long wage support scheme will trigger 800,000 job losses in April, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility's latest economic forecasts. This will lead to unemployment peaking at 2.6 million by next summer - a rate of 7.5 per cent and up from 4.8 per cent now. That is based on the assumption of a mass roll-out of vaccines by the middle of next year, with Covid restrictions in place until then. But it could spiral to 11 per cent under a worst case scenario, which models what happens to the economy if stringent Covid measures have to stay in place throughout next year. Unemployment is forecast to fall each following year - reaching 4.4 per cent by the end of 2024. Despite the gloomy news, Mr Sunak said the UK's unemployment rate is lower than Italy, France, Spain, Canada and the US. And he pledged a package worth over £4 billion to help find jobs for the long-term unemployed, classed as those who have been out of work for more than 12 months. Nurses, doctors and other NHS workers will be exempt from the freeze. And 2.1million public sector workers who earn below the average wage of £24,000 will get a guaranteed £250 pay rise next year. But it was Mr Sunak's decision to slash the overseas aid budget by billions of pounds that prompted a massive row last night. The cut sees the Government tearing up a legal pledge and manifesto promise to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on overseas projects. Mr Sunak told MPs: ""Sticking rigidly to spending 0.7 per cent of our national income on overseas aid is difficult to justify to the British people, especially when we're seeing the highest peacetime levels of borrowing on record."" Instead of the existing target, 0.5 per cent — about £10billion — would be spent in 2021. But one minister walked out of the Government in protest and ex-PM David Cameron lashed out publicly at the decision to lower the 0.7 target, which was a flagship policy of his. He tweeted: ""We share this planet with millions who are starving, with mothers who die needlessly in childbirth and with children who die of preventable diseases and with countries that are broken by conflict, corruption and poverty. ""The questions are: do we care, do we act and do we lead? The promise of 0.7 meant that we — Global Britain — answered 'yes' to all three. And that's a promise worth keeping."" Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby called the decision ""shameful and wrong"". Individuals, families and communities must become stronger, healthier and happier as a result of this Spending Review. That is the true measure of our success. Watch live after PMQs #SR20 pic. twitter. com/smQhWTbrJS And Foreign Office minister Baroness Sugg quit the Government, telling PM Boris Johnson it was ""fundamentally wrong"" to go back on the manifesto pledge. But Mr Sunak insisted that ""at a time of unprecedented crisis, the Government must make tough choices"". As the Chancellor outlined the temporary reduction to the aid promise, 57 per cent of voters backed him compared with just one in seven opposed. And there is support in every age group, social grade, region, and political party, according to a poll by JL Partners for The Sun. James Johnson, co-founder of JL Partners and former pollster at No10, said: ""This poll is a wake-up call for Westminster. ""Voters are overwhelmingly supportive of a temporary cut in foreign aid: almost six in ten voters support it, with 15 per cent opposed. ""More than that, it has the backing of every age group, region, social class and political party in Britain — including Labour voters and the most affluent."" The £4billion recovery fund to ""level up"" the UK will be unleashed across the Red Wall region so pivotal to the Conservatives' 2019 election success. Tory MPs in the Northern Research Group welcomed the cash, saying in a statement: ""In building back better, we cannot just hope our way out of this crisis, and we cannot just hope for a better economic future, we need to plan for one. ""The Chancellor has shown that he, the Prime Minister and the Government is committed to levelling up the North and delivering on the compelling vision of prosperity as set out at the General Election last year."" The JL Partners poll also revealed strong support for the announced ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030 — plus the increase in defence spending worth £16.5billion over four years. THE economic figures now laid bare by Rishi Sunak are the bleakest in our lifetimes. It is depressing how many MPs still cannot grasp their severity. How else to explain their griping over the two decisions the Chancellor took to SAVE money: Cutting foreign aid and temporarily freezing some public sector pay? It is as if our monstrous Covid debts and their consequences are too mind-boggling for some MPs to process. Our economy will shrink 11.3 per cent this year, the worst drop in 300 years. Our annual national overdraft will hit nearly £400billion — far, far worse than even Gordon Brown ran up. That's terrifying enough as a one-off. Except we are likely to borrow £100billion a year for at least four more years. The austerity decade from 2010, which painfully whittled the deficit down from exactly such heights, has been negated within ten months. And while the Chancellor's furlough has saved 300,000 jobs, unemployment will still rocket by more than one million to 2.6million by next summer. The Sun has repeatedly warned of the apocalyptic damage lockdowns do. Here it is. Yet, even in the face of this cataclysm, what really matters to Labour is their voters among non-NHS public sector staff not getting a pay rise. The tsunami of redundancies among private sector workers, and the wage CUT they have suffered, trouble the Left far less. And what really enrages certain Tories is finally reducing the scandalously wasteful aid budget to focus on projects abroad that truly matter — and spending those billions instead on ""levelling up"" long-neglected regions here. The fact we will remain the G7's second largest aid donor cuts no ice with them. There was a little good news: A predicted rapid recovery in growth once the vaccines kick in — and interest rates on our vast borrowings at record lows. Great . . . until they rise. What then? Our debts must one day be paid. From yesterday's performative outrage, some MPs intend to oppose every single sensible saving we will need to make. What planet are they on?"
471,471,The Sun,Natasha ClarkHarry ColeKate FergusonMatt Dathan,Christmas rules: 3 households will be able to form covid bubble for 5 days – but not in the pub,"THREE households will be able to meet up inside for five days over Christmas in a much-needed boost for the nation after a gruelling year of Covid rules. Social distancing and travel rules will be scrapped from December 23 to 27 so Brits can hug their grannies and see their friends as part of a festive plan hammered out on Tuesday. In a boost for the nation after months of crippling restrictions, the UK nations have secured a deal for Brits to be able to see loved ones at last - but they won't be allowed to go to the pub together. The details of the plan include: Social distancing won't need to be kept to during the five day relaxation of the rules, but ministers will remind people to be alert of the risks of spreading the virus. There will be some differences between the four nations of the UK, however, on what counts as a bubble and how people can split up to see family. Cops won't be expected to patrol to enforce the new rules - but will step in if people break them by hosting huge gatherings and hold parties. Shortly after the announcement, Boris Johnson tweeted a video asking people to consider the risks of seeing vulnerable people even though the rules have relaxed. The Prime Minister said: ""The virus doesn't know it's Christmas and we must all be careful."" Mr Johnson added: ""I know this doesn't equate to a normal Christmas and it won't work for everyone and it is up to each of us to think carefully about how we use this special time-limited dispensation. ""The virus has not gone away and families will have to make a personal judgement about the risk of forming a bubble with or visiting elderly relatives and the vulnerable. ""Tis the season to be jolly but tis also the season to be jolly careful."" Speaking following the meeting, Mr Gove said last night: ""The UK-wide agreement reached today will offer hope for families and friends who have made many sacrifices over this difficult year. ""We know that the Christmas period this year will not be normal, butfollowing constructive discussions between the UK Government and theDevolved Administrations, families and friends will now have the option tomeet up in a limited and cautious way across the UK should they wish. ""In coming to this agreement, we have listened to scientific and clinicaladvice on how best to minimise the risk and reach a balanced and workable set of rules that we hope will allow people to spend time together at this important time of year."" But British Beer and Pub Association chief executive Emma McClarkin said: ""These plans for Christmas make a mockery of the extra restrictions being placed on pubs and the economic devastation they are facing this Christmas. ""How can it be that pubs cannot properly open while households can mix in private settings? ""The Government data has consistently shown that house-to-house transmission is one of the highest, whereas hospitality has accounted for as little as two per cent of Covid incidences when open."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she had agreed to a ""cautious and limited"" relaxation of coronavirus rules for Christmas, but stressed there would be no further relaxation of measures at New Year — a big blow for Hogmanay-loving Scots. Can my gran and grandad join us for Christmas? Yes. Any three households can join together to form a Christmas bubble – so granny and grandad can come round for the Turkey dinner. But the government is urging Brits to show common sense and caution when interacting with very vulnerable people in their festive bubble. Can I hug them or should we be socially distant? While you can hug granny because social distancing rules are scrapped in festive bubbles, you should show caution, particularly if they are old or sick. Can my grandparent leave a care home to join us? If granny or grandad is in a care home and over 65, they cannot leave to join your new bubble. They can if they are under 65 and get a negative Covid test. What happens if we burst the bubble and the step-mum arrives unexpectedly? This is against the rules. When three households come together to form a Christmas bubble it is exclusive – you cannot leave it and no one else can join it. But if step-mum arrives, do not expect the cops to turn up at your door. Ministers are urging Brits to voluntarily abide by the rules – they are not expecting police to enforce them. Is there a maximum number of people allowed in my Christmas bubble? No, it's just based on a maximum of three households. How should I travel to see my Christmas bubble? You will be able to travel across all tiers and across all four home nations but the Government is urging people to plan and book journeys in advance, with major disruption and capacity problems expected on the railways. Can I see people outside of my bubble? Yes – but only if you stick to the rules in your tier. For Brits living in Tier 2 and 3 – which is expected to be the vast majority of the country – this means you can only meet up with people outdoors. In Tier 1 you can meet up with people if you stick to the rule of six. Can I go to the pub with my Christmas bubble? No - you can only meet up with them in private homes, at Church or in a public space, such as a walk in the park. You can go to the pub in tier 1 with up to six others inside. In tier 2 you can only go with your household inside, or up to six people outside. In Tier 3 they will be closed. What about New Year's? These bubbles do not apply to New Year's, which will be governed by the regional tiers policy. Can my household split up and form different bubbles? Yes, a mum and dad could decide to spend Christmas separately by forming their own Christmas bubbles. This also applies to a group of people in their 20s who share a flat but can all return to their family homes, for example. But this may only apply in England. People will only be able to form a 'Christmas bubble' with up to two other households - with the rule of six scrapped. Shared households in England - such as friends sharing a flat, or a couple who wanted to see different parents - would be able to split up to join another household for the five-day period. But they won't be able to do this in Scotland - possibly splitting up millions of families. In England, university students returning from halls at the end of term would automatically rejoin their family household and therefore not be included as a separate household. The Tier rules won't be completely scrapped for Christmas - and will apply in areas where the new bubbles rules don't cover them. So if people are in Tier 1, the rule of six will apply. If they are in Tier 2 they will only be allowed to go to the pub or out for dinner with people they already live with - not the whole Christmas bubble. And if they are in Tier 3, the pubs will be shut at Christmas anyway. People who are working shifts over the Christmas period won't be able to move the dates. And sadly, people aged over 65 in care homes will not be able to join their families for Christmas under the new guidance. The rules will be slightly different across the four nations of the UK. People travelling to Northern Ireland will get an extra day or two either side of the dates in order to travel home and back again. In England, support bubbles will continue to be counted as one household - but this isn't the case in Scotland. And from next week, parents with a baby under one year old can form a support bubble with another household in England. Brits living in the top level of restrictions are likely to be able to legally go abroad on holiday - but will be discouraged from making anything apart from essential journeys for the festive season. As 2020 draws to a close, we recognise it has been an incredibly difficult year for us all. We have all had to make significant sacrifices in our everyday lives, and many religious and community groups have already had to change or forgo their customary celebrations to slow the spread of coronavirus and save lives. This cannot be a 'normal' Christmas. But as we approach the festive period, we have been working closely together to find a way for family and friends to see each other, even if it is for a short time, and recognising that it must be both limited and cautious. Even where it is within the rules, meeting with friends and family over Christmas will be a personal judgement for individuals to take, mindful of the risks to themselves and others, particularly those who are vulnerable. We need everyone to think carefully about what they do during this period, balancing some increased social contact with the need to keep the risk of increased transmission of the virus as low as possible. This is particularly important when considering those who are vulnerable, and before deciding to come together over the festive period we urge the consideration of alternative approaches such as the use of technology or meeting outside. In this context, the four administrations have reached agreement on asingle set of UK-wide measures to help people come together with their loved ones in a way that is as safe as possible. Today we have agreed that: *Travel restrictions across the four administrations and between tiers will be lifted to provide a window for households to come together between the 23rd and 27th of December. *Up to three households can form an exclusive 'bubble' to meet at home during this period. When a bubble is formed it is fixed, and must not be changed or extended further at any point. *Each Christmas bubble can meet at home, at a place of worship or an outdoor public place, but existing, more restrictive rules on hospitality and meeting in other venues will be maintained throughout this period. It is important that everyone respects and abides by the rules of eachnation wherever they choose to spend the festive period. Where there are any variations in our approach, these will be communicated by each administration accordingly. Further guidance will be provided in due course. The winter holiday period is a time often spent with family and friends, with schools and offices closing and people travelling over the bank holidays. Many have already begun making their plans, and we are todayproviding clarity to help people make the right choices for them, and enjoy time with those closest to them while staying within the rules to protect us all. It's likely that extra rules will be needed in the run up to Christmas and afterwards to control the impact of allowing families to mix. Although cases have been steadily falling this week, 11,299 more positive cases were reported on Tuesday, along with more than 600 deaths. Britain will go into a tier system next Wednesday after the national lockdown in England ends. More places are expected to be put into the top level - Tier 3 - which will see pubs, restaurants and indoor entertainment shut. People will be banned from household mixing until Christmas. In Tier 2 they will also be unable to see other households inside, and can't drink at the pub without having a substantial meal either. Gyms, beauty salons and shops are set to reopen. There were major efforts under way on Monday from local leaders, MPs and business not to plunge areas into the toughest restrictions. And there was a cross-party effort to stop London going into Tier 3, led by Labour Mayor Sadiq Khan and his Tory challenger Shaun Bailey. Meanwhile, Tory MPs have begged the Government to save Christmas carol singing this year. The group, led by ex-Cabinet minister Esther McVey, said the services will help lift the nation's spirits after a bleak year and raise millions for charities."
472,472,The Sun,Harry Cole,Keir Starmer will ‘order Labour MPs to back Brexit deal to win back North’,"SIR Keir Starmer will order Labour MPs to back a Brexit deal to try to win back the North, his allies claim. Shadow Cabinet sources say the party will support ""almost any trade deal"" that PM Boris Johnson forges with Brussels. They hope that doing so will ""put the issue to bed for good"" and win back the trust of ""Red Wall"" voters lost to the Tories in last year's election. Strategists also say Labour's support will give the PM wiggle room to compromise and still have the votes to get an agreement through the Commons even with objections from those in his own party. Trade talks between the EU and UK are reaching an endgame, with negotiators ""working around the clock to get a deal"", according to Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove. Approval for any deal will be needed by the end of December for it to kick in on January 1, when Britain finally severs ties with the EU. Officially Labour said tonight that ""no decision has been taken about whipping or on votes"". But Sir Keir ally Rachel Reeves is said to have told Labour MPs that he is leaning towards backing the plan."
473,473,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha ClarkSascha O'Sullivan,Boris Johnson reveals tough new tier rules to last until spring after coronavirus lockdown ends next week,"BORIS Johnson last night begged Brits to pull together one more time to banish Covid-19 — with a vaccine promised for the majority by the spring. He set out the Government's tough Winter Plan, warning that Christmas time was ""the season to be jolly careful"" and that local lockdown tiers will last until at least March. Mr Johnson hailed the ""sacrifices of millions of people"" but he dashed hopes of family and friends mixing again for months more. And he called last orders on thousands of struggling pubs by banning those that cannot serve food from reopening when national lockdown ends next week. Setting out the plan, which will be a return to region-by-region rules, Mr Johnson insisted ""no other peacetime PM has asked so much of the British people"". The new strategy aims to get the R rate below one and keep it there with the fresh set of draconian rules, which are likely to be opposed by a string of disgruntled backbenchers. Mr Johnson admitted that ""many more regions will fall - at least temporarily - into higher tiers than before"" meaning more Brits face being unable to see friends and family inside until around Easter. He said: ""The scientific advice, I am afraid, is that our tiers need to be made tougher"". In a frank address to the public alongside Chris Whitty this evening, he admitted that ""those months [ahead] will be hard"" - not least because of the pressure on the NHS. And he said: ""That is why when we come out of lockdown next week we must not just throw away all the gains we have made. ""We will continue to bear down hard on the virus."" And the PM confirmed there WILL be a break in the rules for the festive period - but families will ""need to make a careful judgement"" about visiting older relatives as the virus ""doesn't know"" it's Christmas. He joked at tonight's press conference: ""It is the season to be jolly - but to also be jolly careful... ""We want people to be able to celebrate, but we don't want to ruin it by overdoing it."" Life would start looking closer to normal by Easter, he promised. Most people who need the vaccine will be able to get the jab by then, he said. Brits may start to be able to get a freedom pass to do more activities in areas with mass testing, he suggested too. The rules will be reviewed every 14 days to check if they are working, and to see whether they can be relaxed. The PM will lay out which place will go into which tier on Thursday. He warned today: ""Without sensible precautions, we would risk the virus escalating into a Winter or New Year surge. ""We are not going to replace national measures with a free for all."" Of the vaccine he added: ""We are not out of the woods yet. We can hear the drumming hooves of the cavalry coming over the brow of the hill and they're not here yet."" The new rules, which will come in next week include: The Speaker was forced to pause the Commons halfway through the PM's speech after Boris accidentally put himself on mute during the question and answer session. Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, had to step in to take over after technical issues with the PM - who is still in isolation in No10 after coming into contact with an MP who tested positive. Most of the country is expected to return to the most stringent Tier 3 or high risk Tier 2 - but these will be beefed up. Gyms, beauty salons and all shops will be able to reopen. But in Tier 2 people will only be allowed to drink if they do so with a meal. And punters will only be able to dine indoors with people they live with. In Tier 3 pubs and restaurants will have to be shut completely, along with hotels, and indoor entertainment. Mass testing will be rolled out in the top Covid alert levels in a bid to try and get the cases down again. The hated 10pm curfew will finally be ditched by ministers and replaced with demands to take last orders - and a final closing time of 11pm, giving Brits a chance to finish their drinks before being forced onto the street. In a huge boost for retailers, all shops will be allowed to open in the crucial run-up to Christmas — regardless of their local lockdown measures. The tougher new tiers comes with a slice of good news for families, after the four nations signed off a plan to let people across the UK gather for Christmas. It is understood up to three households will be able to come together for a turkey dinner indoors, subject to final agreement with the devolved nations. There are also hopes that these ""festive bubbles"" will be able to go out for Christmas meals together — as long as they do not mingle with other households. The ban on household mixing in Tiers 2 and 3 will likely be lifted for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day through to the delayed Boxing Day Bank Holiday on December 28. And in Tier 1, the ""Rule of Six"" is set to be suspended to allow bigger groups to celebrate. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said today it was ""likely"" household bubbles would be able to join - but said bringing four households together was not discussed. She said there is an ""obvious desire"" to reunite over Christmas but stressed it needed to be done ""safely"" to minimise risks. Ministers will look at five criteria to work out what tiers to put the nation back into. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said it was ""too early to say"" which places will go into which tiers. He told LBC today: ""Based on the numbers that I've seen, which is a slow down in the virus spreading, it's coming down in parts of London in a couple of boroughs. ""If we continue to make this progress, if Londoners continue to do the right thing, then what I suspect may will happen, what I hope would happen is when the lockdown's lifted on December 2nd, London would probably be in what is called tier two."" Shaun Bailey, the Tory candidate for London Mayor next year, said: ""I'm privately making the case that to get our economy moving, and I mean the country, not just London, London cannot be in Tier 3. If we are, many businesses will collapse. Tonight it emerged that gloomy Sage scientists wanted Covid hotspots to be placed into even tougher new Tier 4 restrictions — as they claimed the old three tiers of restrictions were not tough enough to push the R rate or transmission down below one. But this was overruled by Mr Johnson, who is banking on tougher restrictions on pubs, along with the roll-out of mass testing in the worst-hit areas, to do away with the need for a fourth tier. He dangled hope that those in Covid hotspots who repeatedly test negative for the disease could get freedom passes to meet with pals Emma McClarkin, from the British Beer & Pub Association, said: ""Our sector has been singled out by these new measures which unfairly target pubs. The additional restrictions will destroy our sector."" And scientists suggested Mr Johnson's gamble may not pay off, claiming mass tests may fail to pick up people with Covid who have low viral loads. They warned: ""The ability of these tests to detect infection at points in the infection cycle is poorly understood."" Despite his hopeful tone, Mr Johnson's latest clampdown was greeted by anger in Westminster. One Tory MP even warned the PM it ""did not end well"" for Oliver Cromwell, the ""last ruler who told us how we may or may not celebrate Christmas"". Mr Johnson told MPs the increase in new Covid cases in England is ""flattening off"" after the nationwide lockdown measures. But he warned: ""We are not out of the woods yet."" Mr Hancock said this morning that Tier 3 combined with mass testing in Liverpool meant new coronavirus cases started to fall ""quite remarkably"". Mr Hancock also talked up the possibility of Brits' lives starting to get back to normal by Easter after the Oxford AstraZenaca vaccine announced it had ""up to 90 per cent"" effectiveness. He said: ""It is subject to that regulatory approval and I really stress that because the medicines regulator, it's called the MHRA, is independent, they're rigorous, they're one of the best regulators in the world. ""They will be very, very careful to ensure that they look at all the data to make sure that this is safe. ""Subject to that approval, we hope to be able to start vaccinating next month."" Most jabs will start being rolled out in January to March, he said. ""And we hope that sometime after Easter things will be able to start to get back to normal."""
474,474,The Sun,Natasha ClarkHarry Cole,"Hairdressers, nail salons and beauty services WILL reopen across the nation after lockdown is lifted","HAIRDRESSERS, nail salons and beauty services will be able to reopen after the lockdown ends, Boris Johnson has confirmed. The PM told the House of Commons that anyone in need of a trim, wax or freshly painted nails will be able to book a slot after December 2. There were fears that all close contact services could have to stay shut in the top tiers - which were announced today - over fears of spreading the virus further. But officials were concerned that they would be unable to stop people going from Tier 3 areas into Tier 2 ones to sneak in an appointment before Christmas. The news means that facials, fillers, hair removals and eye-lash treatments will be given the green light from as early as next Wednesday. Venues must continue to be Covid-secure with visors and face-masks to protect both customers and staff. People will still need to check in using the NHS app or put down their contact details in cases of an outbreak. Most places are appointment-only to reduce the number of people on the site at any one time. The new rules, which will come in next week include: Boris Johnson summoned his Cabinet for a rare Sunday meeting last night to sign off new, toughened measures for England. They will start after the national lockdown ends on December 2 and the country returns to regional coronavirus control tiers, officially announced this afternoon in the House of Commons. Ministers yesterday confirmed a major breakthrough with administrations in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland agreeing to a a joint approach to Christmas. It is understood up to three households will be able to come together for a turkey dinner indoors, subject to final agreement with the devolved nations. There are also hopes that these ""festive bubbles"" will be able to go out for Christmas meals together — as long as they do not mingle with other households. As The Sun revealed last week, strict lockdown rules will be paused for five days. The ban on household mixing in Tiers 2 and 3 will likely be lifted for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day through to the delayed Boxing Day Bank Holiday on December 28. And in Tier 1, the ""Rule of Six"" will be suspended to allow bigger groups to celebrate. In a huge boost for retailers, all shops will be allowed to open in the crucial run-up to Christmas — regardless of their local lockdown measures. Boris Johnson also announced that gyms will be able to open across the country. And he added for a new stricter 4th tier have been abandoned. But the PM warned that most of the country is expected to return to the most stringent Tier 3 or high risk Tier 2. Tier 2 will be ""beefed up"" and pubs will only be allowed to serve booze alongside a ""substantial meal"" and punters will only be able to dine indoors with people they live with. Pubs in Tier 3 will only be allowed to operate on a click and collect basis with no seating inside. In a glimmer of good news for pubs, the hated 10pm curfew will be scrapped — with an hour of drinking and eating up time allowed until 11pm. The PM today addressed the Commons with his updated plans before setting out full details of a five-day Christmas relaxation of tiers later in the week."
475,475,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Covid test: Elderly can leave care homes this Christmas – if family get tested,"ELDERLY relatives will be able to leave care homes to join their family for Christmas as long as everyone has had a test, The Sun has learnt. In a major boost for the UK's half million care home residents, Boris Johnson's ""festive bubbles"" to be unveiled this week will include provisions for grandparents to leave residential care and join a family household. Plans have been drawn up for a single care home resident to be allowed to join a single household over Christmas if everyone in that household has tested negative for Covid-19. Many elderly residents have been isolated from their families for months after care homes were hit hard by the virus. Those that are able to, and choose to visit their families or friends, will have to be tested or isolate when they return from that bubble to their care home after their festive break. Matt Hancock has already vowed to ring-fence rapid Covid swabs so families can visit their relatives in care homes if they want to. A pilot in 20 homes which started last week will end the need for pods and 'prison-style' plastic screens. Key visitors will be tested weekly at locations across Hampshire, Cornwall and Devon. It means they will finally be able to hug and hold hands with their relatives if they test negative beforehand. But the new rules will mean they can come to stay in the homes of their families if they want to as well. The welcome news for the elderly is part of the Christmas deal hammered out between Westminster and the Devolved Administrations in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales at the weekend. It comes after several high profile cases of people being arrested for trying to take their relatives out of their care homes. Ylenia Angeli, 73, had not been able to see mum Tina Thornborough for nine months before she ""sprung"" her from the home in Market Weighton, Yorkshire. ex-Coronation Street actress daughter filmed the moment Ylenia was arrested at a garden centre after wheeling her mum, who has dementia, from the care home before lockdown. Leandra Ashton, 41, who played Saskia Larson on the ITV soap in 2016, filmed the harrowing ordeal as her gran sat helplessly in the family car. Humberside Police said they responded to reports of an assault and Ylenia was subsequently ""de-arrested"". The united ""four nations"" approach for Christmas was agreed with principle by Michael Gove and regional counterparts on Saturday, with the PM expected to outline the full details later in the week. But The Sun revealed last week rules will be relaxed for five days from Christmas Eve until the delayed Boxing Day Bank Holiday on 28 December. Yesterday Mr Gove announced there would be ""limited additional household bubbling for a small number days"" with a cap of three households coming together expected. Households will be able to come together for a turkey dinner indoors amid fears Brits would simply ignore the rules. The ban on household mixing in Tier 2 and 3 of Covid restrictions is to be lifted and the rule of six is set to be suspended in Tier 1 to allow bigger groups to celebrate festive season. The Cabinet Office said there had been ""good progress made by all administrations over the past few days to design a single set of arrangements that can apply across the UK."" ""Ministers reiterated the importance of allowing families and friends to meet in a careful and limited way, while recognising that this will not be a normal festive period and the risks of transmission remain very real."""
476,476,The Sun,Harry Cole,Rishi promises ‘no austerity’ to pay for Covid —  but there will be massive tax hikes,"RISHI Sunak has vowed there will be ""no return to austerity"" to pay for Covid — but gave notice of massive tax hikes. The Chancellor, who presents his one-year Spending Review on Wednesday, warned that tough times are coming. He even joked he would have to ""take away the credit card"" from big-spending PM Boris Johnson. But Mr Sunak insisted now is not the time to impose tax rises ""in the fog of enormous economic uncertainty"". Yet he signalled he would have to begin to balance the books next year and the pain must be shared, meaning tax increases would happen. Mr Sunak will attempt to sugarcoat the pain with £152million earmarked for post-Covid parties in 2022. The cash will go towards the Festival UK — a showcase of all the great things about the country, nicknamed the Festival of Brexit — as well as the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations. He said: ""It has been an incredibly difficult year so I'm delighted the country has a number of exciting events to look forward to."" But a major row has erupted over Mr Sunak's plans to freeze public sector pay. TUC boss Frances O'Grady said nothing could be ruled out when asked if she would advocate strike action. Mr Sunak called it entirely reasonable to consider a pay freeze in an economy ravaged by coronavirus, though it is said to exempt NHS nurses and doctors. Labour claimed a freeze — including firefighters, hospital porters and teaching assistants — will ""make them worried about making ends meet ahead of Christmas"". But Mr Sunak said: ""What you will see is an increase in Government spending on day-to-day public services."" CHANCELLOR Rishi Sunak has had a ""good pandemic"" so far. The furlough scheme is working well (after a few initial hiccups). And his generous package for the hospitality sector stopped thousands of pubs and restaurants being driven into the ground. But giving away money was the easy bit. And Mr Sunak must think very carefully indeed about the measures he takes now to plug the gaping, Covid-shaped hole in public finances. A freeze to public sector pay we can countenance. In fact, it would hardly seem fair if private sector workers — who have been through the mill this year — were taxed to high heaven in order to give state workers with secure jobs a pay rise. Hiking corporation tax, on the other hand, would be an epic mistake. Even a small rise would cripple small firms desperately trying to get back on their feet after lockdown. And deterring entrepreneurs and chief executives from creating companies would be madness when unemployment is at a four-year high already — and set to spiral in the months ahead. We're not surprised that Mr Sunak wants to refill the country's coffers: it's downright alarming that Britain is £2 TRILLION in debt. But bleeding companies dry is no way to go about it."
477,477,The Sun,Harry Cole,New Covid rules mean families can meet for Christmas —  but pubs must serve meals with booze to stay open,"FAMILIES will be told they can meet up in ""festive bubbles"" for five days over Christmas in an early prezzie from the PM. Shoppers should also be able to buy gifts and goodies in the high street next month. But in a blow to the hospitality sector, punters will only be served drinks at pubs if they eat big meals and must stay in household groups.

Mr Johnson is due to tell MPs the increase in new Covid cases in England is ""flattening off"" after the nationwide lockdown measures. But he will warn: ""We are not out of the woods yet."" He will unveil a testing push for Tier 3 areas. It will allow them to ""draw on the support of NHS Test and Trace and the Armed Forces"" for extensive community testing. Workers in food manufacturing, staff in prisons, and those delivering and administering Covid vaccines are also set to be offered weekly testing from December. Mr Johnson will vow that ""with the expansion in testing and vaccines edging closer to deployment, the regional tiered system will help get the virus back under control and keep it there."" More than 70 of his own MPs want rules to be relaxed after the national lockdown ends. But with Labour support, his plans are set to sail through the Commons regardless of any Tory rebellion. THANK goodness the hated 10pm curfew is for the chop. It was damaging and pointless. But we urge the Prime Minister to urgently rethink the countrywide ban on different households mixing inside which is set to replace it. Outdoor socialising was fine in May and June. But precious few will brave ice and sleet to sit in a beer garden. So the miserable intervention will surely kill hundreds of pubs and restaurants. Landlords spent fortunes on making their pubs Covid-secure before the tiers system came in. And after months of endless handwashing and social distancing, customers know exactly how to stay safe. Time for the Government to take a step back and let the industry take it from here."
478,478,The Sun,Nick GutteridgeHarry Cole,Brexit negotiators secretly haggling over fishing fudge that could see trade talks reopened in 10 YEARS,"BREXIT negotiators are secretly haggling over a fishing fudge that could see the EU and UK Brexit trade deal reviewed in 10 years time, The Sun can reveal. In a bid to unlock deadlocked talks, Britain offered up a ""review clause"" on any fishing agreement after three to five years - but Brussels wants it in 10 to 15 years. And crucially they are demanding the appraisal must be of the whole trade deal, not just fishing - opening the door to a decade more of negotiations. The UK team are insisting fishing and wider trade agreement must be kept separate as talks go to the wire - but EU sources think they could climb down. Brits fear reviewing the terms of the deal in the future would give Brussels long-term leverage over them if UK fishing waters are back up for grabs in 2030. The EU could once more use access to their markets to put the squeeze on No 10 for a greater share of the spoils of Britain's waters. Last night fishing industry chiefs urged Boris Johnson to reject the idea out of hand. Any perceived climbdown on fishing will infuriate Brexit purists in the Tory party, but Labour are hinting heavily they will back a trade deal if one can be secured in a bid to put their internal Brexit strife to bed for good. Our revelation comes after face to face meetings between the two sides were paused due to a Covid outbreak in the EU team. But they are likely to resume later this week in London with only a few days delay for much hoped for breakthrough. Sources on the UK side say some significant progress has been made on the so-called Level Playing demands from Brussels to tie the UK to their red tape indefinitely. But they stress the two sides are ""still miles apart on fishing."" One source said: ""They still don't get it. They are still demanding basically 80 per cent of the access they have now to UK waters and are sticking to that demand."" Barrie Deas, from the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, said: ""I'm sure that a 10 year deal with links to trade would suit the EU very well. ""But it would not be compatible with the UK's status as an independent coastal state, and I would expect it to be rejected if tabled."" THE Chancellor is right: we don't want a Brexit deal at any cost. The fishing fudge — which would allow Brussels to interfere with our waters for another ten years — is not what Brits voted for in 2016. And it would go down like a lead balloon with Red Wall voters in coastal towns and villages. Boris and his negotiators have been admirably consistent from the start: a deal that is compatible with our newly won sovereignty is the only one that Britain can accept. They must not lose their grip now."
479,479,The Sun,Harry ColeHolly Christodoulou,Christmas is saved! Festive bubbles will let households mix for 5 days over Xmas period,"CHRISTMAS has been saved this year with households allowed to ""bubble up"" for five days to enjoy the festivities together. Families will have to choose their social bubble in advance and will be able to spend time indoors with them - including at the pub. It is understood a limited number of households will be allowed to meet under the plans. But this is yet to be signed off by the government, which is still trying to thrash out agreement with leaders in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The ban on household mixing will likely be lifted for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day through to the Bank Holiday on December 28. Once the merriment is over, Brits will then return to tough tier restrictions being announced by Boris Johnson tomorrow. What Brits can do this Christmas: But Brits will have to stick to social distancing guidelines still - meaning they will not be able to hug loved ones. As The Sun revealed last week, strict lockdown rules will be paused for five days for Christmas. It comes after fears Brits would simply ignore the rules - with Met chief Dame Cressida Dick saying cops have ""other things to do"" than barge in on Christmas lunches. The festive reprieve has been confirmed today by ministers after negotiations between all four devolved governments. Michael Gove said there would be ""limited additional household bubbling for a small number of days"". A statement from the Cabinet Office said: ""Ministers reiterated the importance of allowing families and friends to meet in a careful and limited way, while recognising that this will not be a normal festive period and the risks of transmission remain very real. ""As such, Ministers endorsed a shared objective of facilitating some limited additional household bubbling for a small number of days, but also emphasised that the public will be advised to remain cautious, and that wherever possible people should avoid travelling and minimise social contact."" However, a Scottish Government spokesman said: ""No agreement has been reached and discussions are continuing."" The proposed new rules Boris will announce tomorrow: As part of other Christmas plans, beauty salons, gyms and hairdressers are also expected to open for a ""morale boost"". And the government is also in discussions about how it might allow some pantomimes to go ahead during the festive period. It comes ahead of Boris unveiling his winter Covid plan to the Commons tomorrow, which will include the re-introduction of the tier system once lockdown lifts next month. Under the ramped-up Tier 2 and 3 rules, millions of Brits will be banned from mixing with other households indoors. Tier 2 - which covered large swathes of the country before lockdown - is expected to be beefed up to be more in line with the previous tier 3. It's understood pubs will only be allowed to serve booze alongside a ""substantial meal"" and punters will only be able to dine with people they live with indoors. Pubs in Tier 3 face even more stringent measures to reopen. It's expected they will be allowed to operate only on a click and collect basis with no seating inside. It means that aside from the five-day Christmas break, Brits will effectively be in lockdown via tiers until Easter when ""normal life"" will hopefully resume. In one positive step, Boris is said to be calling time on the controversial 10pm curfew on pubs and restaurants. He instead plans to extend opening hours until 11pm - with the hope this will stop revellers congregating in crowds on the streets. Earlier this week, Public Health England boss Dr Susan Hopkins said Christmas ""is possible"" but warned it could come at a price. She said harder measures could be needed before and after Christmas to make up for the five days of festive freedom. Dr Hopkins said: ""We are keen to have Christmas as close to normal as possible, but that will require every effort now and in early December to get cases as low as possible to reduce transmission."" And Chancellor Rishi Sunak has reiterated that Christmas this year ""is not going to be normal"". He added: ""I think it's difficult to be so precise and granular about the impact of any individual measure that we might take. ""I think the good news is we're going to be exiting national restrictions, which is something that I think people at the beginning of this were doubtful of. ""The Prime Minister will be setting out more details tomorrow about going back to a more localised approach, seeing what we can do to allow families to see each other at Christmas time. ""But it is not going to be normal."""
480,480,The Sun,Tariq TahirHarry Cole,Priti Patel ‘suffered racism & misogyny’ at Home Office that was ‘worst of her career’ as bullying row rumbles on,"PRITI Patel suffered ""racism and misogyny"" at the Home Office that was the ""worst of her career"", it has been claimed. The allegation comes after the Home Secretary issued a grovelling apology over the findings of a bullying probe. But she has privately told friends that the Home Office is the most hostile environment she has ever worked in, the Sunday Times reports. A source close to her said: ""Priti has worked in the private sector in FTSE 100 companies but the racism and misogyny she has endured at the Home Office has been the worst of her career."" Another source had witnessed inappropriate behaviour directed at her. ""She has experienced things would not have experienced had she not been a woman of colour,"" they said. ""She doesn't conform to peoples' opinion of her. There is this type in the civil service which is woke and leftie. ""Priti is the absolute opposite of that, which inevitably leads to tensions."" The report found that while there was no behaviour which amounted to outright bullying, staff felt that they had been subject to unnecessary behaviour from Ms Patel. In the wake of its findings, Ms Patel said in a statement: ""I am sorry that my behaviour in the past has upset people. ""It has never been my intention to cause upset to anyone."" She also said in an pooled clip yesterday evening: ""I work with thousands of brilliant civil servants every single day and we work together, day in, day out to deliver on the agenda of this Government. ""I am absolutely sorry for anyone that I have upset."" In the wake of the report, Boris Johnson has ordered his MPs to defend ""The Prittster"". The Prime Minister said the accusations that she shouted at staff fell down because the investigation said she was ""legitimately frustrated"" at the poor performance of Civil Servants. Mr Johnson's decision prompted long term Whitehall anti-bad behaviour boss Sir Alex Allan - who had conducted the inquiry - to resign after his finding that Ms Patel's behaviour could be seen as bullying was ignored. Strict rules for ministers outlaw bullying and say staff must be treated with courtesy and respect at all times, and his report found Ms Patel had: ""not consistently met the high standards required."" Mr Johnson said today he ""has full confidence in the Home Secretary and considers this matter now closed"". The PM said today he ""will not tolerate bullying"" but did not believe Ms Patel's actions was guilty of it. His press secretary Allegra Stratton told reporters this lunchtime Mr Johnson considered Ms Patel's apology ""full and frank"". Ms Stratton added:  ""He does take this issue extremely seriously - the Home Secretary's behaviour needs to be seen in context. ""And he says there was no evidence she was aware of her behaviour at the time."" Ministers are normally expected to resign if they break the code and there are no known cases of a minister staying in post following a breach. Sir Alex Allen said in the report: ""My advice is that the Home Secretary has not consistently met the high standards required by the Ministerial Code of treating her civil servants with consideration and respect."" He added that Ms Patel ""approach"" had ""amounted to behaviour that can be described as bullying in terms of the impact felt by individuals"". Although the report acknowledged Ms Patel may have been unaware of how her staff felt her behaviour ""still amounted to a breach of the Ministerial Code, even if unintentionally."" Sir Alex pointed the finger at the civil service as well, blasting them for being inflexible. He said: ""The Civil Service itself needs to reflect on its role during this period. ""The Home Office was not as flexible as it could have been in responding to the Home Secretary's requests and direction."" Ms Patel was not backed up by her own staff and no one who felt victimised by the Home Secretary raised the complaints with her, Sir Alex added. The full report detailing evidence of staff complaints against Ms Patel is not expected to be released in full. Sir Alex resigned after the PM let the Home Secretary off with a slap on the wrist. He said in a statement: ""It is for the PM to make a judgement on whether actions by a Minister amount to a breach of the Ministerial Code. ""But I feel that it is right that I should now resign from my position as the Prime Minister's independent adviser on the Code."" As the civil service was thrown into uproar Chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life Lord Evans of Weardale said his committee would look ""urgently"" at what had happened as part of its review of the ministerial code following Sir Alex's resignation. Home Office permanent secretary Matthew Rycroft said the report made ""difficult reading"" but added the relationship between officials and ministers had ""improved considerably."" Former Treasury official Nick Macpherson piled into the fray, saying ""bullying at work is never justified"" following the revelations Ms Patel was let off because it was ""unintentional"". He added: ""Things have to be very bad indeed for a Cabinet Office enquiry to find fault in a minister -the system is rigged to conclude the contrary."" The row over Ms Patel exploded in February after top civil servant at the Home Office Sir Philip Rutnam quit, saying Ms Patel mistreated staff by swearing and shouting - claims she has always denied. Sir Philip claimed he was subject to a ""vicious"" campaign against him. A spokesperson for No10 said: ""The PM is reassured the Home Secretary is sorry for inadvertently upsetting those with whom she was working with but ultimately as the arbiter of the ministerial code, weighing up all the factors, the PM doesn't believe there is a breach."" Tory MP Andrea Leadsom, the former Business Secretary, rushed to the Home Secretary's side, saying: ""I have known @pritipatel for many years as a friend and colleague. ""Yes, she's strong and forthright in her views which is one of her great assets. Ms Leadsom added: ""I have never seen her bully anyone. She is also empathetic and incredibly kind."" Ex-Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith leapt to Ms Patel's defence, saying she ""is strong willed and determined to get the job done."" The grandee added: ""There is a history of poor civil service leadership at the Home Office and the report is critical of that. ""She is no bully but a good minister."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer demanded the PM force Ms Patel out of Cabinet, accusing him of playing favourites. He said: ""Yet again, the Prime Minister has been found wanting when his leadership has been tested. If I were Prime Minister, the Home Secretary would have been removed from her job. ""It is hard to imagine another workplace in the UK where this behaviour would be condoned by those at the top. ""The Government should be setting an example. Instead, it is one rule for Boris Johnson and his friends, another for everyone else."" Continuing on Twitter, Sir Keir stormed: ""The Prime Minister has previously said he 'loathes bullying'. ""Yet when one of his own ministers is found to have bullied their staff he ignores the damning report sat on his desk and instead protects them."""

As part of the Government's agenda to flatten the North/South divide, the Chancellor will also reveal the North East location of a new Treasury HQ. Ministers have vowed to move 22,000 civil servants out of London in the next decade, and next week's Spending Review will outline the first wave. And the Chancellor has earmarked dozens of road improvements in the North. All new government policies will also have to be shown what they contribute to each region of the UK before being given the greenlight under new plans. Mr Sunak is also set to spend billions boosting Britain post-Brexit. He is expected to use £1billion to strengthen the UK border and and commit billions to trying to soothe current north-south tensions in the country. Last night Mr Sunak said: ""We are absolutely committed to levelling-up opportunities so those living in all corners of the UK get their fair share of our future prosperity. ""All nations and regions of the UK have benefited from our unprecedented £200 billion Covid support package.

Ms Patel was not backed up by her own staff and no one who felt victimised by the Home Secretary raised the complaints with her, Sir Alex added. The full report detailing evidence of staff complaints against Ms Patel is not expected to be released in full. Sir Alex resigned after the PM let the Home Secretary off with a slap on the wrist. He said in a statement: ""It is for the PM to make a judgement on whether actions by a Minister amount to a breach of the Ministerial Code. ""But I feel that it is right that I should now resign from my position as the Prime Minister's independent adviser on the Code."" As the civil service was thrown into uproar Chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life Lord Evans of Weardale said his committee would look ""urgently"" at what had happened as part of its review of the ministerial code following Sir Alex's resignation. Home Office permanent secretary Matthew Rycroft said the report made ""difficult reading"" but added the relationship between officials and ministers had ""improved considerably."" Former Treasury official Nick Macpherson piled into the fray, saying ""bullying at work is never justified"" following the revelations Ms Patel was let off because it was ""unintentional"". He added: ""Things have to be very bad indeed for a Cabinet Office enquiry to find fault in a minister -the system is rigged to conclude the contrary."" The row over Ms Patel exploded in February after top civil servant at the Home Office Sir Philip Rutnam quit, saying Ms Patel mistreated staff by swearing and shouting - claims she has always denied. Sir Philip claimed he was subject to a ""vicious"" campaign against him. A spokesperson for No10 said this lunchtime: ""The PM is reassured the Home Secretary is sorry for inadvertently upsetting those with whom she was working with but ultimately as the arbiter of the ministerial code, weighing up all the factors, the PM doesn't believe there is a breach."" Tory MP Andrea Leadsom, the former Business Secretary, rushed to the Home Secretary's side, saying: ""I have known @pritipatel for many years as a friend and colleague. ""Yes, she's strong and forthright in her views which is one of her great assets. Ms Leadsom added: ""I have never seen her bully anyone. She is also empathetic and incredibly kind."" Ex-Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith leapt to Ms Patel's defence, saying she ""is strong willed and determined to get the job done."" The grandee added: ""There is a history of poor civil service leadership at the Home Office and the report is critical of that. ""She is no bully but a good minister."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer demanded the PM force Ms Patel out of Cabinet, accusing him of playing favourites. He said: ""Yet again, the Prime Minister has been found wanting when his leadership has been tested. If I were Prime Minister, the Home Secretary would have been removed from her job. ""It is hard to imagine another workplace in the UK where this behaviour would be condoned by those at the top. ""The Government should be setting an example. Instead, it is one rule for Boris Johnson and his friends, another for everyone else."" Continuing on Twitter, Sir Keir stormed: ""The Prime Minister has previously said he 'loathes bullying'. ""Yet when one of his own ministers is found to have bullied their staff he ignores the damning report sat on his desk and instead protects them."""
483,483,The Sun,Harry Cole,Ministers vow not to be ‘the Grinch that stole Christmas’ but hopes fade of spending New Year with family,"MINISTERS have vowed not to be ""the Grinch that stole Christmas"" — but hopes are fading of seeing in the New Year with friends and family. Boris Johnson's proposal for a relaxing of lockdown across the UK has hit a snag after Nicola Sturgeon raised fears about Hogmanay parties in Scotland. Downing Street and the devolved administrations are working on a plan that will see five days of festive household mixing allowed from December 24 to 28. But Scotland's First Minister warned in a call with Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove that, with New Year's Eve being bigger than Christmas Day for some Scots, rules could be broken then. A Whitehall source claimed: ""She said she wanted to talk to her chief medical officer about what to do before agreeing to the Christmas plan."" Her team last night furiously denied she tried to throw a spanner in the works but she appeared to snuff out any hopes of big parties to see in 2021. Prof Gabriel Scally, from Bristol University and a Sage member, warned meeting family at Christmas could make it a dangerous time and mean ""burying relations in January"". Meanwhile, figures suggest the virus in England has stopped growing and deaths may peak soon. Researchers say the R rate is on a ""clear downward trend"" and around one in all regions. The Government yesterday reported a further 501 UK deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test, taking the toll to 53,775."
484,484,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Priti Patel blasted in bullying probe but Boris Johnson to keep her as Home Secretary after officials also slammed,"HOME Secretary Priti Patel ""unintentionally"" broke the Cabinet rules, a Whitehall bullying probe has concluded. But Boris Johnson is unlikely to sack his close ally after her department was also blasted for poor performance. A row exploded in February after top civil servant at the Home Office Sir Philip Rutnam quit, saying Ms Patel mistreated staff by swearing and shouting - claims she has always denied. But the formal probe into the affair has concluded that her frustration with the poor leadership from officials in her department was justified, and no concerns were raised with her about bad behaviour. The investigation is likely to warn civil servants working at the Home Office must also ""reflect"" on their behaviour after ignoring Ms Patel's orders. But the Sun understands it will also flag up strict rules for ministers that state that they must treat staff with ""consideration and respect"" at all times. The Prime Minister will tomorrow rule on the formal investigation conducted by top Whitehall sleaze-buster Sir Alex Allan who advises Mr Johnson on bad behaviour. But insiders suggested Ms Patel was unlikely to face the chop due to the widespread criticism of all involved in a draft of the report. A well placed source said Mr Johnson was ""absolutely standing by Priti"". Insiders said the probe has found Ms Patel was unaware of any concerns due to a lack of leadership from senior mandarins - meaning any complaints were not able to be addressed at the time. It is understood that the report finds there has been a dramatic improvement in relations between the Home Secretary and her officials in recent months after a change of guard in the department. A summary of the findings is due to be released tomorrow, but Labour have demanded the whole document be published ""immediately"". Shadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas Symonds warned :""These revelations could not be more serious."" He added: ""This has all the hallmarks of a cover up from the Prime Minister and raises fundamental questions about his judgement."" But former Tory leaders Sir Iain Duncan Smith leapt to Ms Patel's defence, saying she ""is strong willed and determined to get the job done."" The grandee added: ""There is a history of poor civil service leadership at the Home Office and the report is critical of that. ""She is no bully but a good minister."" And Conservative MP Dr Kieran Mullan said: ""Having worked closely with Priti Patel I never saw any bullying behaviour, just someone determined."" He added: ""Nobody is perfect and I'm sure she would be gracious about doing things differently, but being told 'computer says no' by officials sometimes takes grit to get through."""
485,485,The Sun,Harry ColeJonathan ReillyNick Parker,Small businesses urge Boris Johnson to end lockdown on time as they face shutting for good,"PUBS head a plea by small businesses to save them from shutting for good. Bars across the country are joined by local shops and the beauty industry in begging Boris Johnson to end the lockdown on time and rescue their crucial December trade. Their grim warnings of closure come amid fears that, even if lockdown is lifted on December 2, it will be replaced by business-busting restrictions. After The Sun revealed plans to suspend bans on household mixing for five days over Christmas, Government medics even suggested each day of festive freedom will require another five days of lockdown. But last night the traders were backed by the powerful Covid Recovery Group of 50 Tory MPs. They insisted in a statement: ""We cannot keep living under a cycle of lockdowns and restrictions. ""Freedom cannot just be for Christmas. We've also got to develop a much better strategy for living with this virus."" Nearly three quarters of pubs fear limits could see them close for good. Just one in four can turn a profit in Tier 1 regions, while 94 per cent said Tier 3 restrictions could mean they never reopen. A joint spokesman for UK Hospitality, British Institute of Innkeeping and British Beer and Pub Association said: ""Much of our sector could be gone within a year. ""We recognise that local restrictions will need to be based on local risk levels, but we believe the tier system should be fine-tuned. ""That means relaxing the ban on more than one household in Tier 2 and extending the 10pm hard curfew cut-off point."" Greg Mullholland, of the Campaign for Pubs, added: ""Pubs can just about survive Tier 1 but any other levels are catastrophic. What publicans are demanding is the opportunity to open safely. ""If not, people will just go and enjoy themselves in unregulated environments, in private homes or elsewhere, where the risk of spreading the virus is far greater. ""It's vital that the industry is able to take advantage of the festive season. After all, a British Christmas without going to the pub with friends and family is hardly a British Christmas at all."" Wetherspoons boss Tim Martin said ministers ""must get rid of the catastrophic and ever-changing tiers, lockdowns and about turns"". He added: ""Unless they do, unemployment will rocket and we're guaranteed a 1970s-style crisis."" The beauty industry also called for clarity so that hairdressers, barbers and salons can open their doors ahead of any festivities. Richard Lambert, of the National Hair and Beauty Federation, said: ""With the amount of money salons and barbers have spent and the hoops they have jumped through to welcome back clients — these businesses must be given the chance to operate and recover."" Rose Videtta, who has owned and run Hairlines hair salon in Bletchley, Bucks, for 30 years, told The Sun: ""This is our busiest time of year. We have to open on December 3. They will kill us and other small businesses if we can't."" Shops joined the clamour for more clarity from the Government. With the toy industry worth more than £3.2billion, toy stores said they should be classed as ""essential retail"" or Christmas will be ruined for kids and businesses alike. Craig Beaumont, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ""Small firms have lost November but need to know soon what they can do through December. ""They need to have the necessary staff on hand, suppliers prepared and safety precautions in place to ensure they can take full advantage of the final few festive weeks. ""The past nine months have been incredibly difficult for so many, which is why we need to know a roadmap for the future as soon as possible."" Last night the Confederation of British Industry called for an exit strategy to be published at least seven days before December 2. Acting director-general Josh Hardie said it would help firms ""hit the ground running"" and try to ""salvage the best from a bad year"". Adam Marshall, of the British Chamber of Commerce, said: ""Nine months into the pandemic, business communities are still crying out for timely information and a clear strategy from the Government so that they can survive and rebuild."" According to a NatWest study, small firms are bearing the brunt of the latest Covid restrictions. The bank found that activity contracted in October — the first time since June. Service providers with fewer than 50 employees suffered the biggest impact. Separate research showed smaller retailers are finding business much tougher than in 2008 when the last financial crisis started. Data from the Centre for Economic Business Research and O2 found that retail sales collapsed by 24 per cent at the height of the first lockdown, compared with a 3.9 per cent slide in 2008. The appeals for help came as latest figures showed another 529 people in the UK have died with Covid with 19,609 more infections in the last 24 hours. But the tolls are dropping. Last Wednesday 22,950 new coronavirus cases were recorded along with 595 deaths. The Wednesday before that 25,177 people tested positive. It means the infection rate is 15 per cent down on last week and 22 per cent down on the week before. Despite the ray of light, Dr Susan Hopkins said: ""For every day we release, we will need five days of tighter restrictions. ""So we need to be very careful about the number of contacts we have to reduce transmission before Christmas and get our cases as low as possible."" In total, the UK has now recorded 1,430,341 positive test results and 53,274 deaths."
486,486,The Sun,Harry Cole,Whopping £300million Covid bailout for struggling British sports to be unveiled by Ministers today,"MINISTERS will today unveil a massive £300million Covid bailout for struggling British sports - but nothing yet for hobbled football league clubs, The Sun can reveal. The cash will help keep clubs and teams afloat without fans this winter as plans are yet again delayed to get fans back into grounds and stadiums because of soaring virus rates. The cash will go to rugby union, horse racing and low level semi-pro men's and women's football. Rugby league, motorsport, tennis, netball, basketball, ice hockey, badminton and greyhound racing also in line to benefit in the ""winter survival package"". But negotiations are ongoing between the Premier League and smaller professional clubs about a football industry funded bailout demanded by ministers. The package will be presented by Culture and Sports boss Oliver Dowden in the House of Commons this afternoon. Last night a source close to him told The Sun: ""The funding, which will be largely composed of loans, is the most generous of any Government for its domestic sport sector in the world, and will focus on sports severely impacted over the winter."" On Monday Boris Johnson vowed to his MPs that he would ""bring the fans back"" to sports, adding: ""Don't run away with it but we need to do much better."" He said: ""I pledge that when we come out of lockdown on December 2 we will work to have the crowds to come back."""
487,487,The Sun,Harry Cole,Tory minister Robert Jenrick brands Nicola Sturgeon ‘frankly mad’ after plea for Scottish independence referendum,"A TOP minister has branded Nicola Sturgeon ""frankly mad"" — escalating a major spat between Tories and the Scottish nationalists. The cross-border dustup came after The Sun revealed the PM had claimed the Scottish Parliament had been a ""disaster"" for the UK and was Tony Blair's ""biggest mistake"". Nats reacted with fury and Scottish Tories warned Mr Johnson was a threat to the Union. But pouring petrol on the row, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick took aim at the nationalist leader's plea for a referendum, raging: ""Any politician who wanted to hold a referendum on a topic like this, at this moment in time, is frankly mad."" And he added Scottish independence is a ""dangerous and disappointing outcome that we need to battle against."" And rejecting claims for a second referendum on Scottish independence, Mr Jenrick said: ""We're in the middle of a very serious health situation, a pandemic, and we're also seeing massive disruption to people's lives and livelihoods as a result of the economic disruption that's flowed with it."" Following his comments, No10 attempted to dampen the row, saying the PM ""has always supported devolution but he is at heart a unionist and he is very troubled by the rise of nationalism and separatism."" Downing Street said Mr Johnson is determined to be the ""voice of the majority"" in Scotland who voted against independence in the 2014 referendum. ""The PM has always fully supported devolution. This Government continues to put the Union at the heart of everything that we do,"" they added. ""The PM believes that we had what was a once-in-a-generation referendum and that the result of it should be respected. He firmly rejects the SNP's call to break up the United Kingdom."""
488,488,The Sun,Harry ColeKate FergusonNatasha ClarkJonathan Reilly,Christmas could be saved as Government plans 5 days of household mixing indoors for groups bigger than 6 over holidays,"FAMILIES could be allowed five days to enjoy get-togethers over Christmas. Health chiefs are looking at the idea in a last-ditch bid to save the Covid-hit festivities. The aim is to unite the UK under a common rule that enables households to mix indoors for a limited period. Ministers fear a mutiny of mums if they do not hatch a workable plan and are worried relatives will throw big celebrations regardless. Health bosses are eyeing a five-day run when households could mix  starting on Christmas Eve. The plan will come as a huge boost to families who feared they might miss out on seeing their loved ones over Christmas. But it may be less welcome news for those hoping they'd get away with not inviting the in-laws. The Sun can reveal that Sage scientists have been modelling the impact of groups bigger than six meeting up. With Christmas Eve falling on a Thursday and a planned Bank Holiday for Monday December 28, ministers are zeroing in on that five-day weekend for a short lifting of a ban on gathering in homes. But those households that choose to link up are unlikely to be able to mix with others outside that grouping during the celebrations. Ministers are looking to thrash out a ""Four Nations"" festive plan. They would like England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to have the same Christmas treat. But they and medics fear a full week of rules being relaxed would ""normalise"" mixing and want to cap it at a matter of days. The limited relaxation of the rules is bad news for office Christmas parties and socialising that is so vital to the hospitality sector. No10 confirmed last night: ""We are looking at ways to ensure that people can spend time with close family over Christmas at the end of what has been an incredibly difficult year."" However, Boris Johnson - who is self-isolating after contact with an MP who tested positive for Covid — will not fully sign off any plans until next month. A ""sliding scale"" of options are under discussion but are dependent on the Covid situation. We are looking at ways to ensure that people can spend time with close family over Christmas. Depending on virus rates, the rule of six could be expanded temporarily, with the possibility of exempting kids from the cap. One insider told The Sun: ""Discussions are ongoing about different options. Exempting under-12s is possible."" England is due to return to the tiers system of localised restrictions on December 2, with household mixing outlawed indoors in the top two tiers. A relaxation of restrictions would be required in much of the country to allow families to come together. If England excludes under-12s from the rule of six it would fall into line with Wales and Scotland where kids are already exempt. Families will be told to keep their windows open and try to stick to social distancing rules over the Christmas weekend. Whitehall insiders insisted that no firm decisions have been made, and crunch talks are continuing. They also fear that letting grandparents meet up indoors in big family get-togethers while Covid and flu rates are high could pose a big danger. One insider said: ""We are realistic and pragmatic — but we have got to balance that with the risk of bringing people together during the height of the pandemic."" Ex-Sage scientist Prof Neil Ferguson told the BBC there are ""ways of going part way"" in allowing families to meet at Christmas without cases soaring. He said: ""You could think of allowing three or four households to bubble together for a week but not contact anybody else, which would give more opportunity to see loved ones but not a free-for-all."" We have got to balance that with the risk of bringing people together during the height of the pandemic. Cabinet Minister Robert Jenrick admitted publicly last night that plans are still up in the air. He said it was too early to judge the true impact of the national lockdown on Covid figures because there is a ""lag time"" of two or three weeks. He also said there was no decision yet on whether a new tougher Tier 4 would be needed. It came as Nicola Sturgeon announced huge swathes of Scotland would go into the top level of their shutdown rules — in a national lockdown in all but name. She told the country: ""These decisions will give us the best possible chance — albeit in a limited and careful way — of being able to ease restrictions in all parts of Scotland for Christmas."" Another 598 people in the UK have died from coronavirus. Yesterday's daily death toll was the highest since May 6. Tuesday figures are always high after a weekend backlog. The total death toll is 52,745. Some 20,051 people tested positive bringing total cases to 1,410,732."
489,489,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak to slash UK’s bloated foreign aid budget to fill Covid black hole,"BORIS Johnson and Rishi Sunak will slash the UK's bloated foreign aid budget to fill the Covid blackhole, No10 all but confirmed today. As The Sun revealed in August, the Chancellor has his eyes on the hallowed cash  — up to £15billion a year — to help plug the budget black hole caused by the virus. Britain is legally bound to spend 0.7 per cent of output on foreign giveaways, but on Tuesday Downing Street said the law allows that pledge to be suspended in extreme times. Mr Johnson's spokesman said: ""There may be circumstances in which the government is not able to meet 0.7% commitment – if that happens a Secretary of State has to lay a statement in parliament."" The massive hint came after Cabinet Minister Robert Jenrick said the Covid crisis meant that ""there is a legitimate question for us to ask at this moment in time whether or not it would be wise to spend somewhat less in light of the fact public finances are in a really challenging situation."" The commitment to spend 0.7p per cent of British GDP on foreign giveaways was a flagship policy for former PM David Cameron, who used to try ""modernise"" the Conservatives. But it's always been loathed by many senior Tories who resented foreign aid swelling even amid cuts to domestic spending and having their hands tied by the arbitrary figure. Although he is understood to have the backing of the PM for the move, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is pushing back on the measure. In September his department took over the Aid department and he has fought back against any attempt to divert funds ever since. When unveiling the merger in June, Boris Johnson warned the UK's aid budget would no longer be a ""giant cash point in the sky"" for countries like India and China. Mr Johnson has also signalled support for ripping  up rules on aid spending Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. He said instead the focus should be on how to use aid spending to  ""maximise British influence"" on the world stage. And while planned slashing of the aid budget would infuriate the charities and opposition parties it would delight scores of Conservative MPs who have hated it for a decade. Jeremy Hutton, a policy analyst for the Taxpayer Alliance, said: ""It's about time ministers made use of this aid loophole. ""As we've long said, the law does allow the aid budget to be slashed in a crisis. ""The Covid pandemic gives Whitehall more than enough wiggle room to do the right thing and ensure taxpayers' money stays at home. ""Well done to Rishi for exploring all the avenues available to cut back wasteful spending and balance the books."""
490,490,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson vows to take part in this week’s PMQs via Zoom as he self-isolates,"BORIS Johnson has vowed to take part in this week's Prime Minister's Questions via Zoom in an historic first. The PM has to self-isolate for another ten days after coming into contact with an MP who was later struck down with Covid last Thursday. But he insisted the blow will not make him miss his weekly bout with opposition chief Sir Keir Starmer and has ordered Commons bosses to set up a video link. In a video confirming he is locked down in his Downing Street flat and office, Mr Johnson promised he has ""plenty more to say by Zoom and other means of electronic communication"". And he insisted he is ""in good health"" and that he has ""no symptoms"" after the meeting with sickly Tory MP Lee Anderson. But despite ""bursting with antibodies"", he said he must obey the rules despite being nearly struck down by the virus in April. Mr Johnson had been planning to start the week by relaunching his premiership after days of brual infighting that resulted in ousting of his top adviser Dominic Cummings and spin doctor Lee Cain. But on Monday morning Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said he did not think the Prime Minister would be ""in any way hampered"" by his isolation. On a visit to a coronavirus testing site in Liverpool, he said the PM must ""follow the rules like everyone else."" He added: ""I'm sure he's incredibly frustrated, I'm sure lots of other people are, but that's the rules."" And Matt Hancock said: ""I know that the Prime Minister will still be making announcements, talking publicly, and you can absolutely do that - the power of Zoom. ""The majority of my meetings with him are on Zoom and it's more convenient for both of us. That's now a pretty standard and regular part of Government business. ""And in fact, I find Zoom much more convenient sometimes. ""He'll still be able to operate perfectly effectively across Zoom. The whole Downing Street is set up for remote working now. """
491,491,The Sun,Harry Cole,Brexit boss David Frost tells PM to prepare to shake on EU trade deal as soon as Tuesday,"BREXIT boss David Frost has told Boris Johnson to expect a Brussels trade deal ""early next week"", The Sun can reveal. Britain's chief negotiator has pinpointed ""a possible landing zone"" as soon as next Tuesday. But talks could still collapse over fishing and red tape, with both sides urging the other to ""get real"". The PM last night said he would not row back on his Brexit red lines amid claims Cabinet members are pushing for a climbdown. Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Business Secretary Alok Sharma have been accused of urging a compromise. That could bind Britain to Brussels rules forever and give the EU huge access to the UK's fishing waters. And some ministers have said Michael Gove has warned No Deal will lead to Scotland breaking away. Last night, pals of all three denied the claims — insisting they are fully behind the hardline strategy. But a Government source said: ""It's not a secret that the Treasury has always been anti-No Deal and Michael Gove has concerns about the Union."" On the other side, some in Cabinet believe the quality of the deal being offered by the EU is so poor that the effects of No Deal will be limited. No10 admitted ""key elements of the draft text are not agreed"" but insisted ""the Government is united behind the negotiation position"". EU chiefs said they are ready to take talks right down to the wire and find a ""creative solution"" to avoid an accidental No Deal. An EU diplomat said the cut-off point is New Year's Eve and Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said she is more interested in the ""quality"" of the deal than the ""craziness"" of deadlines."

The greeny TV star retweeted Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner's tirade against ""sickening"" Tories to his 444,000 followers, sparking calls for Tim Davie to get tough. Last month the new BBC Director General issued new rules for BBC stars and their social media behaviour, but critics say Packham's tweet has ""fallen at the first hurdle."" Those working in ""factual journalism"" are ordered not to ""express support for any political party."" And they are banned from expressing views ""on any policy which is a matter of current political debate or on a matter of public policy, political or industrial controversy, or any other 'controversial subject'."" Now critics say the outspoken Springwatch and Autumnwatch presenter has fallen foul of the clampdown by sharing Ms Rayner accusation of ""sickening cronyism"" that ""makes a mockery of our fight against Covid"" in a row about Government spending. The boss of the Countryside Alliance said: ""Tim Davie's new social media guidelines have fallen at the first hurdle."" Campaigner Tim Bonner added: ""Few BBC presenters are more closely associated with the corporation than Chris Packham and it is difficult to imagine more partial and party political use of Twitter than this."" And Conservative MP Greg Smith said: ""It is incomprehensible that Chris Packham is flouting BBC social media guidelines. ""Given the BBC's bias problem, the Corporation needs to get tough with their presenters who continue to drag their reputation and credibility into the mud.""

493,493,The Sun,Jonathan ReillyHarry Cole,Britain’s ‘most influential black man’ donates cash to the Conservative Party for the first time,"BRITAIN'S most successful black businessman has donated to the Conservative Party for the first time, The Sun can reveal. Hedge fund boss Ric Lewis, 57 who was named the most influential black businessman in Briton last year donated a £50,000 war chest to help rid London of Labour mayor Sadiq Khan. And other leading black businessmen have also backed the Tory candidate Shaun Bailey in a major win for the party. Mr Lewis, who manages £11bn in property has handed over the cash towards the election next year and is Britain's most successful black man. His firm Tristan Capital Partners is the largest black-owned, black-run business in Britain. The campaign has also been boosted by city high flyer Wol Kolade - who has paid £30,000 directly to the campaign. Mr Kolade, who made his money in private equity, has helped hundreds of young black people enter the financial services industry through his initiative '100 black interns.' Another leading businessman who donated to the campaign, but declined to be named said: ""We need change in London, we have parts of this once great city that are now no go areas for the police. ""It's  becoming like New York in the 1980's. Shaun Bailey will hold Khan to account for the mess he's made of the capital's  transport system and his failure to tackle knife crime. ""Business backs Bailey as they know he will get things done if elected Mayor and we intend to help him make that happen."" Property tycoon Nick Candy is also understood to have handed £20,000 to the mayoral campaign - after previously donating £100,000 to the Tory party. Campaign sources say Mr Bailey's campaign fund is nearing the million pound mark for this year, but is some way off the £2.5 million raised by now PM Boris Johnson in his 2012 election campaign. A Shaun Bailey campaign spokesman said: ""We don't comment on campaign donations. ""We are however delighted at the support Shaun has received from both the public and business. ""London needs fresh leadership, under Khan crime in the capital is out of control, he's bankrupted TfL and failed to deliver on housing. The message is clear, Business backs Bailey."" A Conservative Party spokesperson said: ""The Conservative Party receives a wide range of support. ""Donations to the Conservative Party are declared to the Electoral Commission and published by them."""
494,494,The Sun,Brittany VonowHarry Cole,Dominic Cummings may retaliate with ‘explosive stunt’ after PM ousted him ‘over unflattering texts about Carrie Symonds’,"DOMINIC Cummings may retaliate with an ""explosive stunt"" government insiders claimed today - amid reports he was ousted by the PM over unflattering texts about Carrie Symonds. The Prime Minister is claimed to have ordered the senior adviser to leave after being made aware of messages that had been sent about his fiancée. It was claimed this week by the Telegraph that Cummings' crew of ""Brexit Boys"" had seen them refer to Ms Symonds as ""Princess Nuts Nuts"" behind her back. And Mr Cummings was last night sent packing after a showdown with the PM - seen again leaving his home in London this morning and refusing to comment. But sources today told the Financial Times they did not expect the top adviser to go quietly. One told the newspaper: ""I won't be surprised if there's an explosive stunt between now and Christmas."" Another added: ""It's not Dom's style just to quietly drift away."" The PM finally lost his patience with the Vote Leave veteran amid lockdown rows, leaks, and attacks on Ms Symonds, reportedly leading to a 45-minute showdown. But government sources told the Telegraph that claims the PM had accused him of briefing against him were an ""invention"". Yet the PM sensationally banished the guru and his long time spin doctor Lee Cain - a move heralded by senior Tories last night as Boris ""taking back control of his premiership"". The Sun has learnt a livid Prime Minister wanted him and ousted PR man Lee Cain out ""sooner rather than later"" and they will work out their notice away from Downing Street. The Times reported it was feared the pair would ""poison the well"" if they were allowed to remain in their jobs until the end of the year as initially planned. A No10 source said: ""The atmosphere is one of reset and change and that can't happen with those two still in the building."" It comes after months of simmering Downing Street tensions and bitter backstabbing - with the PM's move shocking Westminster. A source said: ""Their behaviour in the last 72 hours was toxic and Boris said enough is enough."" Insiders pointed to vicious negative briefings to the press about Ms Symonds and anonymous claims that chief Brexit negotiator David Frost could follow the pair out of the door as ""crossing the line."" Once all powerful, Mr Cummings threw in the towel on Thursday evening following ""a shouty"" confrontation with the PM over the ousting of his close ally Mr Cain. Last July, Mr Cummings, the mastermind of the historic Brexit referendum victory in 2016, was given full control of Mr Johnson's administration when he got the keys to No10. He was known to boast that the ""Vote Leave"" gang were running the country now, and he did so with a heavy hand. Mr Cummings was regarded as being more powerful than most ministers, exerting control over the Government's agenda and demanding iron discipline from the army of Whitehall special advisers. Alongside his close ally Mr Cain, he had been accused by MPs, aides and Ms Symonds of destroying Mr Johnson's premiership with their aggressive antics and disdain for the Cabinet. The pair had been central to Mr Johnson's rise to power and stunning election victory last December, but tensions over the Covid-19 pandemic drove different factions into bloody civil war behind the famous black door of 10 Downing Street. The Vote Leave veterans were furious they had been overruled by the PM over the appointment of Allegra Stratton, a pal of Ms Symonds, to a new role as the face of No10 in planned TV briefings and saw it as shot across their bows. And Cummings and Johnson have been increasingly at odds since Mr Cummings' controversial breaking lockdown-breaking trip to Barnard Castle, at the height of the pandemic. It came to a head last night as the Brexit guru, who had originally planned to leave in the New Year, chose to exit through the front door past waiting photographers carrying a cardbox box full of his possessions. The divisive figure was instrumental in the Brexit campaign and went on to be hired by Boris to deliver it following his rise to PM in 2019. The Tory campaigner is known for his aggressive style - and was played by Benedict Cumberbatch in a Channel 4 drama about the referendum. But Mr Cummings has long caused tensions in Government, wanting to overhaul the civil service and shake up crusty Whitehall departments."
495,495,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Livid Boris Johnson gives ousted Dominic Cummings marching orders after attacks on fiancée Carrie Symonds,"BORIS Johnson gave Brexit bruiser Dominic Cummings his marching orders rather than letting the axed aide serve until Christmas, The Sun can reveal. The Vote Leave veteran quit after a brutal Downing Street power struggle saying he would serve in No10 until the end of the year when Britain finally exits the EU. But lockdown rows, leaks and attacks on his fiancée Carrie Symonds were the last straw for the PM who was heralded by senior Tories last night for ""taking back control of his premiership"". The Sun has learnt a livid Prime Minister wanted him and ousted PR man Lee Cain out ""sooner rather than later"" and they will work out their notice away from Downing Street. A No10 source said: ""The atmosphere is one of reset and change and that can't happen with those two still in the building."" The PM finally lost his patience with his two enforcers after months of simmering Downing Street tensions and bitter backstabbing - sensationally banishing the guru as well as his long time spin doctor to the shock of Westminster. A source said: ""Their behaviour in the last 72 hours was toxic and Boris said enough is enough."" Insiders pointed to vicious negative briefings to the press about Ms Symonds and anonymous claims that chief Brexit negotiator David Frost could follow the pair out of the door as ""crossing the line."" Friends of Lord Frost said he was ""baffled"" by the rumour and warned it undermined his position staring down Brussels in the final stages of trade talks with the EU. Once all powerful, Mr Cummings threw in the towel on Thursday evening following ""a shouty"" confrontation with the PM over the ousting of his close ally Mr Cain. It came amid a week of spectacular briefing and counter briefing that would have made the sweary fictional aide Malcolm Tucker from the BBC's Thick of It blush. Ms Symonds and a number or powerful female No10 aides had objected to a plan to promote Mr Cain to No10 boss and told the PM directly of their concerns. That sparked the chain reaction and vicious retaliation in the press that ended with Mr Cummings last night packing up his desk and leaving with a box of his possessions for the last time. Relieved insiders compared the mood in Downing Street last night to ""thawed Narnia"" after news of the shock departures ripped through Whitehall. Last July Mr Cummings, the mastermind of the historic Brexit referendum victory in 2016, was given full control of Mr Johnson's administration when he got the keys to No10. He was known to boast that the ""Vote Leave"" gang were running the country now, and he did so with a heavy hand. Mr Cummings was regarded as being more powerful than most ministers, exerting control over the Government's agenda and demanding iron discipline from the army of Whitehall special advisers. Alongside his close ally Mr Cain, he had been accused by MPs, aides and Ms Symonds of destroying Mr Johnson's premiership with their aggressive antics and disdain for the Cabinet. The pair had been central to Mr Johnson's rise to power and stunning election victory last December, but tensions over the Covid-19 pandemic drove different factions into bloody civil war behind the famous black door of 10 Downing Street. The Vote Leave veterans were furious they had been overruled by the PM over the appointment of Allegra Stratton, a pal of Ms Symonds, to a new role as the face of No10 in planned TV briefings and saw it as shot across their bows. And Cummings and Johnson have been increasingly at odds since Mr Cummings controversial breaking lockdown-breaking trip to Barnard Castle, at the height of the pandemic. Mr Johnson battled to keep his right hand man, but it cost him dearly in the polls and with his MPs. But it was a series of high profile cockups like the A-level fiasco, Lockdown 2 leak and undignified public spat with England striker Marcus Rashford over free school meals convinced the PM that a dramatic shake up was needed in his top team. One source said: ""Dom has always been big picture and punch ups. But he has no interest and isn't very good at the day to day tedious stuff and the pandemic has made that very clear. Things came to a head this month when Mr Johnson was incensed by a massive leak of his plans to plunge England back into lockdown before he had made a final decision. The finger of blame was pointed at the pair, which they deny, amid accusations they tried to frame Health Secretary Matt Hancock for the news getting out. BRIT negotiators accused eurocrats of clutching at straws with claims No 10 will cave in on Brexit in the wake of Dominic Cummings' exit. Officials say Brussels is realising the PM will not budge from his commitment to regain control of our laws and waters. Senior EU figures hope that Mr Cummings' fall from grace will pave the way for a compromise deal. Top German MEP Manfred Weber, who is close to German chancellor Angela Merkel, said: ""We need a clear idea from Boris Johnson. Britain has red lines, we have red lines, let's now come to a compromise."" Belgium's veteran MEP Philippe Lamberts said Mr Cummings' departure was ""probably the sign that Johnson has begun his U-turn and will in the end accept EU conditions"". However the PM's spokesman said: ""We want to reach a deal but it has to fully respect the sovereignty of Britain."" UK negotiator David Frost will head to Brussels on Monday ahead of a crucial video call of EU leaders on Thursday. France's Europe minister Clement Beaune warned ""we'll be in trouble"" if talks stretch into next month. Ironically this past week had been shaping up to be a pretty good run for the Government with the double boost of a vaccine in sight and a warm and early overture from President Elect Biden. But all hell broke loose after a fledgling plan appeared on the frontpages on Wednesday to bump up Director of Communications Cain to Chief of Staff as consolation for Ms. Stratton joining the PR team. Mr Cain stormed out in the row, and Ms Cummings followed him out soon after. Senior Tories delighted in the news, with Theresa Villiers saying Dominic Cummings' departure from No 10 will be ""a good opportunity for a fresh start"". The former environment secretary added: ""Clearly there are concerns about the dismissive attitude sometimes shown by Lee Cain and Dominic Cummings towards people in Government and MPs on the backbenches. ""And this is an opportunity to move on from that and to have a more collaborative approach."" Senior Tory backbencher Sir Bernard Jenkin told the BBC: ""It's an opportunity to reset how the Government operates and to emphasise some values about what we want to project as a Conservative Party in Government."" He said it is time to restore ""respect, integrity and trust"" which he said have been ""lacking in recent months"" between No 10 and Tory MPs. ""I'm not surprised in a way that it is ending in the way it is. No prime minister can afford a single adviser to become a running story, dominating his Government's communications and crowding out the proper messages the Government wants to convey."" He added: ""Nobody is indispensable."""
496,496,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha ClarkKate Ferguson,Dominic Cummings will QUIT by Christmas after having ‘wings clipped’ by Boris Johnson,"BREXIT guru Dominic Cummings will quit by Christmas after having his ""wings clipped"" by Boris Johnson. The former Vote Leave boss confirmed his departure late last night - after losing a key ally in spin doctor Lee Cain. It came after a day of intense speculation over his future in Downing Street. A senior source had earlier said: ""If he's not gone by the end of the week, I doubt he will still be here next year."" Meanwhile the PM's team were accused of fighting ""like rats in a sack"" on the day it should have been responding to the highest number of Covid cases ever recorded. Mr Johnson is now under pressure to bring in ""someone with big boy pants"" to get a grip of No10. The turf war follows the dramatic resignation of his top PR man Mr Cain in a bitter power struggle between aides and his fiancé Carrie Symonds. Mr Cain, who wanted more powers, was enraged by Allegra Stratton's appointment to be the new face of No10 at daily White House style TV briefings. A compromise idea of making Mr Cain the boss of all No10 staff sparked a backlash from senior female aides including Ms Stratton, backed by pal Ms Symonds. Dominic Cummings threatened to walk out in - and some senior Tories say the PM should ease him on his way. Sir Charles Walker, vice-chairman of the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers, said that there had been ""unhappiness"" about the Downing Street operation for some time. ""Members of parliament have felt excluded from the decision-making process, and that's no secret,"" he added. And Jake Berry, an old ally of Mr Johnson who leads a group of 50 Northern tory MPs, said: ""As we go past that grim milestone of 50,000 deaths from this appalling disease, it's high time that there was a bit of a change of guard in No 10."" Sir Roger Gale MP warned: ""A PM, particularly one facing the difficulties Mr Johnson is facing, needs heavyweight help. It really is time that Downing Street got in place somebody with big boy pants on."" But fellow Brexiteer Jacob Rees Mogg leapt to Mr Cain's defence saying: ""May I just say what a fantastic public servant he has been, somebody instrumental in ensuring the Vote Leave campaign was successful and somebody who has made a huge contribution to this government."" This morning No 10 declined to say whether he had formally handed in his notice, whether he had told Boris Johnson of his departure and whether an exit date had been set. But they vehemently denied that his exit would soften the UK's negotiating stance in post-Brexit trade negotiations with Brussels. And Tory MPs urged a rethink in relations with the Parliamentary party. Senior Tory backbencher Sir Bernard Jenkin told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It's an opportunity to reset how the Government operates and to emphasise some values about what we want to project as a Conservative Party in Government."" He said it is time to restore ""respect, integrity and trust"" which he said have been ""lacking in recent months"" between No 10 and Tory MPs.

""And this is an opportunity to move on from that and to have a more collaborative approach."" By Kate Ferguson A FEMALE government aide sacked by Dominic Cummings and frogmarched out of Downing Street by cops has been given a five figure pay-out. Former Treasury spinner Sonia Khan was sensationally fired after being accused of staying in touch with her ex-boss Philip Hammond. Her dramatic sacking sparked a ferocious backlash from Tory MPs, who were furious at the way the young aide had been treated. Ms Khan had threatened to sue the government and haul the No10 team into what would have been a blockbuster employment tribunal. But she reached an out of court settlement of up to £100,000 with Downing Street. The move means Mr Cummings and other No10 bosses will escape being grilled on their conduct by a judge. The Sun understands that Ms Khan was given a five figure pay-out. In a statement, she said: ""Following 14 months of negotiation, I have today reached a settlement with the Treasury, my former employer, and as a result I am no longer pursuing my employment tribunal claim which was due to be heard in London in December."" She added:  ""Having reached a settlement of these issues I am now moving on with my life and career. ""I have a fulfilling job as a consultant, I maintain great affection for the Conservative Party and remain a committed Conservative. ""The party took me under its wing when I was a teen and I feel hugely privileged to have served as a special adviser under the last two Prime Ministers."" Last night Labour claimed Government infighting was hampering the fight against Covid. A spokesman said: ""Boris Johnson's Government is fighting like rats in a sack over who gets what job. It is precisely this lack of focus and rank incompetence that has held Britain back."""
497,497,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson and his team accused of fighting ‘like rats in a sack’ as UK has highest ever day of coronavirus cases,"BORIS Johnson and his team were accused of fighting ""like rats in a sack"" on the day the highest ever number of Covid cases was recorded. The Prime Minister is under pressure to bring in ""someone with big boy pants"" to get a grip of No10 after the dramatic resignation of his chief spin doctor Lee Cain in a bitter power struggle and rows between aides, MPs and his fiancé Carrie Symonds. And now Mr Johnson is under pressure from senior Tories to ease out his controversial guru Dominic Cummings after the former Vote Leave boss threatened to walk out in the Downing Street turf war. Former BBC and ITV journalist Allegra Stratton's appointment to be the new face of No10 at daily White House style TV briefings had enraged Mr Cain, who was backed by fellow Brexiteer Mr Cummings in his demand for more powers. The row erupted after a fledgling plan to make Mr Cain the boss of all No10 staff as a compromise sparked a furious backlash from senior female aides including Ms Stratton who was backed by her pal Ms Symonds. Following a showdown with the PM on Wednesday night Mr Cain quit, with allies hinting Mr Cummings could follow him out - a threat that had not yet materialised on Thursday afternoon. Yesterday ministers and MPs urged the PM to bring in a ""peacemaking grownup"" to run his office and keep baying factions in No10 in check. Sir Charles Walker, vice-chairman of the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers, said that there had been ""unhappiness"" about the Downing Street operation for some time.

498,498,The Sun,Harry ColeJonathan Reilly,Lee Cain quits as Boris Johnson’s top spin doctor after furious backlash to him taking job as No10 chief of staff,"BORIS Johnson's top spin doctor dramatically quit last night after a bombshell day of Downing Street turf warfare. Ex-newspaperman Lee Cain threw in the towel after an evening showdown with the Prime Minister over whether to appoint him No10's powerful chief of staff. The fledgling plan had leaked on Wednesday sparking a massive backlash from senior figures in Government. Cabinet ministers and MPs erupted, pointing to ""months of communications and PR disasters"" like the row with Marcus Rashford and the Lockdown 2 U-turn. And insiders say a number of female No10 aides including press secretary Allegra Stratton and policy guru Munira Mirza raised their objections about Mr Cain directly with the PM. And it was even claimed Mr Johnson's fiancé Carrie Symonds had attacked the idea amid concerns about Mr Cain's abrasive management skills and pandemic handling. Last night Mr Cain said: ""After careful consideration I have this evening resigned as No10 director of Communications and will leave the post at the end of the year. ""It has been a privilege to work as an adviser for Mr Johnson for the last three years – being part of a team that helped him win the Tory leadership contest, secure the largest Conservative majority for three decades."" Mr Johnson said: ""I want to thank Lee for his extraordinary service to the government over the last four years. ""He has been a true ally and friend and I am very glad that he will remain director of communications until the new year and to help restructure the operation. He will be much missed."" The row started after Ms Stratton, a former ITV and BBC journalist, was hired last month to be the new face of No10 on TV - against Mr Cain's wishes. While Dominic Cummings retains his position as Mr Johnson's most powerful political aide, No10 insiders believe someone else is needed to focus on the day to day running of Mr Johnson's operation as Chief of Staff - a role Mr Cummings shunned. One source said: ""Dom has always been big picture and punch ups. But he has no interest and isn't very good at the day to day tedious stuff and the pandemic has made that very clear. Lee has been doing that for the last few months rather than dealing with the media."" A cabinet minister had earlier told the Sun: ""I can't find anyone who thinks this is a good idea. Everyone is going tonto."" And another minister said: ""When we've spent the last six months f***ing up the comms how would promoting the comms guy help?"""
499,499,The Sun,Abe HawkenHarry Cole,"UK is first country in Europe to pass grim milestone of 50,000 coronavirus deaths","THE UK has become the first country in Europe to pass 50,000 coronavirus deaths. Boris Johnson said ""we mourn everybody who's gone"" as Britain hit the grim milestone after 595 more deaths were recorded. A devastating 50,365 lives have so far been claimed by the deadly bug. This makes the UK the fifth country in the world to pass 50,000 deaths after the US, Brazil, India and Mexico. And the country has seen the highest number of coronavirus deaths in Europe - with around 7,000 less victims than Italy and France. The official figures released by the Government also showed 1,256,725 people have tested positive for the virus after 22,950 new cases were recorded. And despite hopes of a coming vaccine the PM warned of more tragic losses, saying: ""We're not out of the woods yet. ""Every death is a tragedy, we mourn everybody who's gone and our feelings are with their families and friends. ""It is a global pandemic whose effects, whose treatments, whose implications for the economy, all those have been becoming clearer as the months have gone on."" It comes as: Meanwhile there are 14,196 patients in hospital in the UK, with 1,219 on ventilators. The latest R number is estimated to be at 1.1 to 1.3 with a daily infection growth rate of +2 per cent to +4 per cent. In England 361 people who tested positive for Covid-19 died in hospital. The patients were aged between 43 and 102 and all except 20 – aged between 58 and 95 – had underlying health issues. In Scotland, a further 64 people have died from coronavirus in the past 24 hours – the highest daily total since May. Public Health Wales reported another 45 deaths this afternoon. Yesterday's death figure rose by 532 – the highest rise for six months. Yesterday's rise in deaths is the highest it has been since May 1, when 567 Covid fatalities were recorded. The figure is considerably bigger than it was last Tuesday, when 317 died with the bug. It is also more than double the increase recorded a fortnight ago (263) and raised Britain's death toll to 49,770. The north-west saw the majority of deaths, with 114 fatalities, while 79 people lost their lives in the north-east and Yorkshire. Another 62 fatalities were recorded in the Midlands, with 17 in London, 13 in the south-west, 11 in the south-east and four in the east of England. New stats for England show infection rates in the north remain significantly higher, with just one southern region in the top 50 virus hotspots nationally. The PM signed off a new lockdown in England on October 31 after he was warned by Government scientists that Covid-related deaths could rise to 4,000 a day in a worst case scenario. But the figure has since been revised to 1,000 fatalities per day by the start of December. ""I think he is concerned that he may have been bounced into it,"" the source said. ""The figures seem to be suggesting things were getting better before the lockdown began – we are being shut down for a month when we did not need to be."""
500,500,The Sun,Harry Cole,Two and half tons of cocaine worth nearly £200million seized from POLICEMAN’s house in British Virgin Islands,"NEARLY two and a half tonnes of cocaine has been seized from a serving cop's house in the British Virgin Islands. The £189million stash is the equivalent to three quarters of the entire national budget of the tiny UK overseas territory in the West Indies. The record breaking raid will heap pressure on ministers to do more to tackle corruption in the troubled region that is central to the South American drug trafficking trade into the United States. The 2,300 kg stash was discovered on Friday night hidden in 63 bundles across three vehicles during a raid on a house being built by a serving officer of the Royal Virgin Island Police Force. The officer has been named as Darren Davis, 41, who has served for 20 years in the Virgin Islands Police Force. Intelligence of corruption led to a secret operation by a hand-picked group of special officers leading the charge, but the massive find stunned police chiefs in its scale. Davis and an accomplice have been arrested and his suspected criminal connections are being probed, along with any other bad apples in the force. Law enforcement sources point to possible side effects of the Covid-19 crisis meaning that large amounts of cocaine, usually bound for the United States, is being bottlenecked due to a flat drugs market and restrictions on travel. The BVI is currently under a night time curfew and private boats are not allowed on the waters after dark - meaning nefarious activity has been easier to spot. On Sunday night $99,000 in cash was seized after a high speed boat capsized after dark. Two more individuals were detained, with police investigating if there was any connection to Friday's raid. The BVI was devastated in 2017 by Hurricane Irma and has long been feared as a hotbed of corruption and drug crime. At a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, the territory's Governor Gus Jaspert said: ""This is not the work of a few criminals slipping through the crack, but strong evidence of serious and organised criminality in the British Virgin Islands."" He added ""there may be pockets of corruption facilitating this activity"" and warned ""we must act fast"" to make sure it does not spread. And he confirmed HMS Medway continues to be based in BVI waters to tackle drug smuggling at his request and he was in touch with London about the next steps. The Police Force's commissioner said the ""deep and settling"" case is one ""that will keep me up at night"", describing any suggestion of an internal corruption as a ""violation""."

The Environment Secretary says the US President-elect is wrong to claim the Government's Internal Market Bill threatens peace in Northern Ireland. Last night, the bill was savaged by the House of Lords. Peers overwhelmingly backed moves to throw out clauses that would breach international law by disregarding parts of the last year's Withdrawal Agreement. But the PM has vowed to keep the clauses and plough on with the contentious legislation. And last night Boris Johnson reiterated his and Mr Biden's common interests on strengthening Nato. He said: ""I have no doubt that we will continue to have a very, very strong relationship."" Environment Secretary George Eustice hit out at critics such as Mr Biden, who has Irish heritage, for claiming the bill threatens Northern Ireland's peace. He said: ""It's about protecting it and not undermining it."" He suggested the critics do not know what they are talking about and said the plan is actually a ""safety net"". Mr Biden is expected to warn Mr Johnson in their first phone call not to risk the peace deal with Brexit hardball tactics."

Ben Wallace praised their commitment as 2,500 arrived in Liverpool to begin mass virus testing. He told The Sun the military have been central to the UK's pandemic battle, but added: ""There were no carers' claps for them and much of what they have done has been unseen. ""I am proud that Defence has played — and will continue to play — a major part in easing these pressures. ""Whilst Remembrance weekend will look very different this year, please buy a poppy and think of our brave armed forces — both those who fought for our freedoms in the past, and those fighting for us to be able to regain them today."" He added: ""The UK's Armed Forces have contributed their skills to local planning, testing, transport and logistics. ""They have, as ever, gone the extra mile, and will continue to go above and beyond."" Explaining the role played by the military in Liverpool this week, Mr Wallace said: ""At 47 sites around the city, men and women in combats will administer Covid tests to the people."" THE pandemic may have stopped thousands of sellers from hitting the streets — but it doesn't have to stop you from buying a poppy. MIKE RIDLEY looks at some of the ways you can do your bit for the appeal by going to: …OR POP INTO YOUR LOCAL SAINSBURY'S, TESCO, ASDA, ALDI OR MORRISONS AND BUY A POPPY While all three services will support the scheme, the majority will be drawn from the Army, including 8 Engineer Brigade, the Royal Anglian Regiment and the King's Royal Hussars.

503,503,The Sun,Sascha O'SullivanHarry ColeDan Keane,Mass coronavirus testing in Liverpool branded a ‘shambles’ as PM announces plans to expand scheme to 3 other towns,"A MASS coronavirus testing scheme in Liverpool has been branded a ""shambles"" - as Boris Johnson announced plans to expand the scheme to three other towns in the UK. Residents in the city said they were forced to mingle in hour-long queues with potentially infected Covid-19 patients. Furious Brits participating in the scheme said that asymptomatic and symptomatic people were not segregated as they waited at testing centres. Photographer David Colbran, 51, said: ""It's a shambles, we booked an appointment to have a test for people with no symptoms but half the people here queuing up have symptoms. ""It's not until you get to the first person in hi-vis that they ask you if you have symptoms and you realise you have been standing with people who have symptoms for over an hour."" Joanne Topping, 59, a retired consultant, fumed: ""The staff don't seem to know what is going on. ""Obviously you have to understand that there will be teething problems but there's no fluidity or organisation based on whether you're here for the Operation Moonshot testing or the regular testing because you have symptoms."" Matt Exley, 32, a museum worker said: ""I have come out of my safe house. ""I had no symptoms and I've been mixing with people who are infected without even knowing."" Liverpool and Everton football clubs united to urge residents to take part in city-wide Covid-19 mass testing. Reds manager Jurgen Klopp posted a video message urging people to ""do it for yourself, your family, your colleagues and your city"". Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti also backed it. The pilot scheme has involved 85 testing centres opening across Liverpool as part of Operation Moonshot. It comes as the PM plans to expand the ambitious scheme to three other towns in the UK. Boris Johnson told ITV News the programme would ""very shortly"" be brought to other areas, which have not yet been specified by Downing Street. The PM said: ""What we're doing is really ramping up testing. ""We're not just doing it in Liverpool, there are going to be three other towns around the country where we will be doing it very shortly and then as widely as we possibly can. ""The lateral flow test, which is what the people of Liverpool are doing today, are just part of the armoury of testing equipment."" He added that ""lamp tests"", currently deployed in some medical settings, provided further hope along with an expansion in PCR tests. The PM early hailed the Liverpool program as ""the way forward"" as army troops piled into the city to help administer millions of swabs. Mr Johnson said he thought a ""tripod"" of better treatments, mass testing and hope of a vaccine would help rescue Christmas. Speaking at Downing Street last night, the PM said: ""There is light at the end of the tunnel. ""We have city wide testing starting tomorrow in Liverpool, by working together we can get that great city on top of the virus."" Mr Johnson said the new rapid-turn around test being trialled in Liverpool is ""full of promise"" and they were ""the real way forward"". The Defence Secretary told The Sun how the armed forces will unlock Britain from Covid through mass-testing. Ben Wallace revealed top Ministry of Defence biomedical scientists will oversee troops from the 8 Engineer Brigade, the Royal Anglian Regiment and the King's Royal Hussars as part of the first trial in testing a whole city. And he hinted the Liverpool deployment was the first of many, saying: ""As the latest testing technologies and developments in combating the virus come into play, Defence stands ready to support local communities, and the nation, to benefit from them as soon as possible."" Testing will be carried out in 47 sites across Liverpool, there will be a variety of ways to book a test, including online, walk-up, or by invitation from the local authority. Testing will be carried out in new and existing test sites, using home kits, in hospitals and care home settings, and schools, universities and workplaces. Lieutenant-General Tyrone Richard Urch told BBC Radio 4: ""Now it is all about testing, we've dropped into schools and drop off test kits. ""And now we're off to mass test on a larger scale and our troops have just started arriving over the last day or so."" The military boss said they had been invited to help by Liverpool to help plan the mass testing program and provide logistical support - as well as crucially administer swabs. But it comes as alarm bells started ringing over the accuracy of new tests designed to give results in 20 minutes. In a letter seen by the Guardian, scientists from the Greater Manchester mass testing group raised concerns of the LAMP tests. The letter warned that the tests only showed a sensitivity of 46.7 per cent - meaning it could miss more than 50 per cent of coronavirus cases. The scientists flagged that the data did not support a mass roll out of tests to staff in hospitals or care homes, which was the plan. But the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said it was ""incorrect"" to suggest the tests were not accurate, saying they had been validated by another pilot. And the so-called pregnancy style tests will not be used in Liverpool. Mr Johnson's ""Operation Moonshot"" aims to test 10 million people a day to the tune of £100 billion. The PM said mass testing would allow a return towards normal life. He said: ""The advantage of this approach is that you can tell whether people are infectious or not immediately, within 10 to 15 minutes. ""Without having to worry about the time taken to get the answer from the current testing system, you can help those people to self-isolate if they test positive, and if they test negative, then of course, they're free to do things with other people who test negative in something close to a normal way."" Co-chair of DHSC's Technical Validation Group Mark Wilcox Professor Mark Wilcox said sensitivity could range between 80 per cent and 96 per cent. Professor Wilcox said: ""The direct LAMP tests used in Manchester have been validated in other laboratories and in real-world testing for use in different settings. ""It is incorrect to claim the tests have a low sensitivity, with a recent pilot showing overall technical sensitivity of nearly 80% rising to over 96% in individuals with a higher viral load, making it important for detecting individuals in the infectious stage. ""The challenge now is to understand the reasons for the difference in claimed sensitivity in one evaluation versus those in multiple others."""

And he repeated that he wouldn't comment on the election until the final results were in. ""I don't think you would expect any international leader to comment on the democratic process of a very friendly country. ""I don't think I'd want anyone in another Government commenting on our elections in our country and while the votes are being counted. We should wait and see."" Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, who is close to the likely next President, moved to scotch talk that Mr Biden is anti-Boris and anti-UK. And he said it was time for a reset after the diplomatic chaos of the Trump years, as world leaders began making overtures to the next likely White House boss. The Biden friend and Democrat colleague told the BBC: ""I would expect Mr Biden, who has deep experience in Foreign Policy, to re-engage, reimagine our alliances and our relationships, but particularly our special relationship with the United Kingdom."" He added that ""at times President Trump has strained and destabilised North Atlantic relations, the US and UK, US and EU but in particular the vital NATO strategic relationship. ""I think all of that would get a fresh look from a new administration… and I would expect our alliances to be close, stronger and more secure than they have ever been."" ""I expect Joe Biden to re-energize our focus on democracy and open society in the face of challenges from Russia, China and Iran and elsewhere in the world,"" he added. But in one word of caution, Senator Coons added the likely incoming administration would be keeping an eye on Brexit talks. He said: ""I expect he would be concerned about making sure the Good Friday accords are protected and respected and the ways in which the UK EU terms are negotiated do not put risk the stability of the border in Northern Ireland."" Mr Johnson was previously warned he faces an uphill struggle after he was perceived by many Democrats of being a close Trump ally. When he won his own election victory last December, Mr Biden described Mr Johnson as a ""physical and emotional clone"" of the US President. Former Chancellor George Osborne told CNN: "" I don't think Joe Biden will feel particularly warmly toward this British government, and they're going to have to work very hard to change that."" Last night Downing Street confirmed that Mr Biden has never met with the Prime Minister and cautioned that the time must be given for the US Election process to unfold, in a coded dig at President Trump who demanded counting cease."
505,505,The Sun,Harry ColeNick Gutteridge,Brussels accuses Britain of stalling Brexit talks to see if Donald Trump loses election,"BORIS Johnson rejected Brussels taunts that Britain is stalling in Brexit trade talks to see if Donald Trump loses the White House. Downing Street said it was "" simply untrue"" that fears in London that a Joe Biden administration would take a tougher line on a US/UK trade deal could prompt greater concessions to Brussels by the UK side to get a deal with the EU instead. One source branded the claim from EU officials ""wishful thinking"" and ""desperate stuff"". The latest spat came as Michel Barnier has thrown out British pleas to elevate the Brexit talks to leaders' level warning they're now on a ""trajectory"" for No Deal. In a private briefing to senior MEPs he railed against the UK's efforts to turn the last leg of the negotiations into a ""mass bargaining session"". According to well-placed sources the Frenchman complained No10 wants to leave as many as 30 subjects open for a ""big tug of war at the end"". He fears the PM's plan is for a last-ditch showdown with EU bosses like Ursula von der Leyen and Angela Merkel to squeeze out more concessions. That would see key interests like access to fishing waters and commitments on common standards played off against each other in a high stakes poker game. Mr Barnier is said to be highly frustrated with British delaying tactics and insisted: ""I keep telling them that's not going to happen. ""You can't have things going up to that level that haven't been gone over with a fine toothcomb."" And he briefed diplomats that if there's no change in the UK's approach next week then a deal won't be reached. The British and EU negotiators are taking a three-day break from talks and will get together again in London on Sunday. And some on the EU side claimed Britain had called time on talks early this week amid the election chaos in the United States. But meetings between their deputies are carrying on, especially over the stand-off on over rules to prevent unfair competition. Yesterday the Bank of England forecast a 1 per cent hit to the economy in early 2021 as a result of the end of the Brexit transition period - even if there is a deal with the EU. Downing Street was forced to deny that the extension to the coronavirus furlough scheme, which will now run until the end of March, was partly motivated by fears about the economic disruption that will occur on January 1."
506,506,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Boris Johnson vows lockdown WILL end on December 2 after furlough extension sparks fears of five-month clampdown,"BORIS Johnson was urged last night to ensure lockdown ends on December 2. News yesterday that the furlough pay scheme will be extended led to fears the curbs will last five months. The Prime Minister said that if everyone worked together to put Covid ""back in its box"", four weeks of restrictions would be enough for ""as normal a Christmas as possible"". But senior Tories warned there could be no backsliding on the date. Rebel leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said: ""I voted against this latest lockdown because I believed we were already succeeding in getting the infection rate down. ""But now that it has happened we must absolutely — for the sake of the economy and people's livelihoods — come out on December 2 at the latest, not a day longer."" Former Cabinet Minister Theresa Villiers told The Sun: ""This lockdown must not last a day longer than December 2. ""To save the retail sector, to save the economy and to save Christmas we must come out bang on time."" We must absolutely — for the sake of the economy and people's livelihoods — come out on December 2 at the latest. Chancellor Rishi Sunak had warned of a grim winter as he was forced to pay for the jobs protection scheme until the spring — just days after saying it would not be the right thing to do. But speaking from No10 on the first day of the new national lockdown, Mr Johnson insisted there was ""light at the end of the tunnel"". The PM said the country would return to the tiered system of local lockdowns after four weeks — dismissing claims by ministers that restrictions could be extended. He said: ""These measures, though they are tough, are time-limited. The advice I have received suggests that four weeks is enough for these measures to make a real impact. ""So these rules will expire, and on December 2 we plan to move back to a tiered approach."" He added: ""I perfectly understand why people feel frustration but the overwhelming majority of people will work together again to get the R (rate) down. ""We can do this and we will do this by December 2 and I have every confidence that if we follow this package of measures, I have no doubt people will have as normal a Christmas as possible and we will be able to get things open before Christmas too. That is the objective"" At the same press conference, NHS England chief Sir Simon Stevens took a more cautious note, suggesting ""we will know conclusively"" on December 2 whether the measures were working — rather than saying they would end then. The PM's pledge came as statistics watchdogs slammed his use of data to convince the country of the need for harsher restrictions. The UK Statistics Authority hit out following criticism of modelling used at Saturday's Downing Street press conference to announce the latest lockdown in England, which suggested deaths could reach 4,000 a day unless action was taken. They said: ""The use of data has not consistently been supported by transparent information being provided in a timely manner. ""As a result, there is potential to confuse the public and undermine confidence in the statistics."" Hitting back, Mr Johnson said: ""We try to make things as clear as we possibly can."" By Nick McDermott, Health Editor NHS boss Sir Simon Stevens showed just one slide during last night's Downing Street briefing. Gone were the widely discredited dodgy predictions of 4,000 daily deaths. Instead, he revealed that two months ago, 500 Covid patients were taking up hospital beds. Now there are 11,000. He also said that, in comparison, there are 7,000 cancer patients on wards and 3,000 flu. But context is key too. There are still 11,000 more spare NHS beds than there were a year ago. He acknowledged that the ""projections vary widely"" and there was also a ""political judgment"" to be made, taking into account the economic consequences. He added: ""It's very, very tough to make exactly the right call."" In a split, Sir Simon directly criticised government doctors Professor Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance's use of data at press conferences, saying it was at times ""a bit hard to keep up with"". He displayed one simple chart showing the number of patients being looked after in hospitals across England. He said: ""It's the equivalent of 22 of our hospitals across England full of coronavirus patients. ""Those are facts, those are not projections, forecasts, speculations, those are the patients in the hospital today."" Mr Johnson also came under pressure to explain falling Covid numbers in London which suggested his tiered system was beginning to work. Yesterday data showed that in 19 out of 32 London boroughs, cases of the virus had gone down after two weeks of Tier 2 rules. In 11 boroughs the decline was by more than ten per cent. Last night Downing Street claimed the ""measures we had in place were working in suppressing the virus's natural rate of spread"" but said more had to be done ""to go further and protect the NHS."" Towns and city centres were a lot quieter on the first day of lockdown yesterday. In London, Waterloo station saw far fewer rail commuters as more people worked from home. Newcastle city centre was almost empty for most of the day after shops closed for a month. THE fact that Covid cases were already plummeting across London is yet more evidence the new lockdown is a mistake. The tiers system would have worked given the chance. Yes, a few hospitals around Britain are under huge strain, as NHS chief Simon Stevens says. But many have few Covid patients or none. A nationwide lockdown is a political error for the PM too. It clobbers working-class people far harder than middle-class penpushers still logging on at home for a Zoom call. And they are exactly the voters the Tories need, and to whom they owe a debt. Donald Trump exceeded expectations in the US election because he tapped into working-class people's desire for more opportunity, low tax and tougher action on crime — as well as their rejection of socialist fantasies, woke moralising and ""social justice"" thuggery. Boris has to learn from that — and never lose sight of the ""levelling-up"" agenda which helped him win power. The impact on working people's lives and livelihoods should be a key factor in every Covid decision. Starting with keeping that promise to release us on December 2."
507,507,The Sun,Sascha O'SullivanNatasha ClarkHarry Cole,Boris Johnson promises four-week lockdown is long enough to save Christmas,"BORIS Johnson today promised a four-week lockdown IS enough to tackle the coronavirus and save Christmas. But he warned everyone must work together to put covid ""back in its box"" if they want ""as normal a Christmas as possible"". He addressed the nation at a press conference hours after pubs, restaurants, non-essential retail and most other businesses were forced to close today and Brits were given fresh stay at home orders for four weeks. The Prime Minister insisted there was ""light at the end of the tunnel"" and the country would return to the tiered system of local lockdowns after four weeks - after ministers suggested restrictions could be extended. Mr Johnson told the nation: ""These measures, though tough, are time limited. ""The advice I have received suggests that four weeks is enough for these measures to make a real impact. ""There is light at the end of the tunnel."" And on the holiday period, he gave the nation a glimmer of hope as they entered four weeks of tough rules, saying: ""We can do this and we will do this by 2 Dec. ""I have no doubt people will be able to have as normal a Christmas as possible and we will be able to get things open before Christmas as well."" Ministers are working on a joint approach to Christmas so that families can come together wherever they live in the UK. But it's only by working together and sticking to the rules can the nation celebrate properly this year, the PM warned. He acknowledged that the nation was ""anxious, weary and quite frankly, fed up with the very mention of this virus."" It comes as: Brits are worried the four-week lockdown is going to have to be extended if the infection rate doesn't come down - which could affect Christmas and the upcoming holiday period for millions of people. Mr Johnson has vowed the tough rules will only last until December 2 as they will automatically expire, but he hasn't ruled out the possibility of extending them if the situation appears bleak. And tonight the PM raised hopes tonight that a coronairus vaccine will be rolled out within the coming weeks. He said that the ""number of shots raining down on the goal is very considerable… and one of them is going to get though soon."" Meanwhile, the Chancellor warned of a bleak winter ahead as he extended furlough today. Speaking in the House of Commons, he said: ""We saw from the first lockdown, the economic effects are much longer lasting for businesses and areas than the duration of any restrictions. ""Given this significant uncertainty, a worsening economic backdrop, and the need to give people and businesses security through the winter, I believe it is right to go further."" Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty told a parliamentary committee earlier this week that if the NHS did become overwhelmed it would crucially threaten the ability of all Brits to be able to access healthcare. A doomsday presentation from Professor Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance predicted the NHS would be flooded with sick patients and unable to cope by the beginning of December if no lockdown was brought in. One extreme forecast from the boffins said as many as 4,000 people could day a die without lockdown - but this was later blasted as out of date. And earlier today the Office for Statistics Regulation today took a swipe at Sir Patrick and Mr Whitty, saying the use of data ""has not consistently been supported by transparent information being provided in a timely manner"". Yesterday the pair insisted current infections justify a second lockdown to prevent the NHS being overwhelmed. They said the tier system was not working fast enough to stop wards from becoming dangerously full. The chief medical officer told the Science and Technology Committee yesterday the situation will ""steadily get better"" from early next year. He said: ""Anyone who thinks about this would be very confident that over the next year, probably even sooner than that, you will have multiple shots on goal from science. ""There will be a rolling through of the extraordinary scientific effort that is currently going on. ""So I am very confident we will get medical countermeasures. What we have to do is hold the line until that point."" Professor Whitty said there is a ""realistic"" chance England would be released from the lockdown after four weeks."
508,508,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson ‘sees light ahead’ in Covid fight thanks to mass Covid testing,"BORIS Johnson said he ""sees light ahead"" in the Covid fight as 3,000 troops and military scientists are deployed to 47 testing sites across Liverpool. The PM said ""better days before us"" as the Defence Secretary told The Sun how the Armed Forces will unlock Britain from Covid through mass-testing. Ben Wallace revealed top Ministry of Defence biomedical scientists will oversee troops from the 8 Engineer Brigade, the Royal Anglian Regiment and the King's Royal Hussars as part of the first trial in testing a whole city. And he hinted the Liverpool deployment was the first of many, saying: ""As the latest testing technologies and developments in combating the virus come into play, Defence stands ready to support local communities, and the nation, to benefit from them as soon as possible."" From Thursday testing will be carried out in 47 sites across Liverpool. There will be a variety of ways to book a test, including online, walk-up, or by invitation from the local authority. Testing will be carried out in new and existing test sites, using home kits, in hospitals and care home settings, and schools, universities and workplaces. Mr Wallace added: ""In this week of remembrance, I am privileged to be surrounded by the men and women who are contributing in vast numbers to tackling Covid. ""There were no carers' claps for them, and much of what they have done has been unseen. Whilst remembrance weekend will look very different this year, please buy a poppy and think of our brave armed forces this week – both those who fought for our freedoms in the past, and those fighting for us to be able to regain them today."" Today Mr Johnson told the Cabinet: ""We don't want to be doing things to repress liberty, we don't want to do anything to damage our economy"" but ""we would see fatalities running in the thousands if nothing was done"". However, the rapid tests could be ""possibly decisive"" in defeating the virus and there were also better drugs and the prospect of a vaccine. ""Amid the uncertain gloom of November, I see light ahead and I'm absolutely certain that we will have better days before us,"" he told ministers."
509,509,The Sun,Nick McDermottShaun WoollerHarry Cole,"Sir Patrick ­Vallance regrets terrifying Brits with doomsday 4,000 daily coronavirus deaths prediction","TERRIFYING predictions that 4,000 people could die of Covid every day were derided as ""Noddy Land figures"" last night. The Government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance shared the bleak number during Saturday night's Downing Street briefing used to justify the second lockdown. But experts said the modelling that provided the figure was outdated, with predicted deaths in early November more than four times higher than current fatalities. Former Supreme Court Judge Lord Sumption said: ""Some of the statistics they have produced over the last few days simply don't bear a moment's examination. ""The most extreme one is the suggestion that there could be up to 4,000 deaths a day. ""That is a figure which no country has ever come close to. These are absolute Noddy Land figures."" Microbiologist Professor David Livermore added that the figures are ""clearly ropey statistics"" and said they ""just don't make sense"". At a Science and Technology Committee hearing yesterday, MP Graham Stringer said the figure had ""frightened a lot of people around the country"". Sir Patrick said he was attempting to be open by sharing a range of potential scenarios. He added: ""If that didn't come across then I regret that, but I positioned that as a scenario from a couple of weeks ago, based on an assumption to try and get a new reasonable worst-case scenario."" England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty also admitted he would not have chosen to share one slide that appeared to mislead viewers over the number of patients in hospital with Covid. And he appeared to distance himself from the modelling saying he had personally ""never used"" the kind of six-week projection that PM Boris Johnson used to claim 4,000 deaths a day could happen by December. It raised fresh questions about how the graph came to be shown to the public during the PM's address to the nation. One source said Sir Patrick had been ""thrown under the bus"" over it. Sir Patrick confirmed the graph was shown to the PM last week before he announced plans for a second national lockdown. That has seen many shops left stripped bare again as panic-buying grips Brits before the shutdown takes effect from tomorrow. But insiders played down the significance of the slide. A source said: ""There was no one graph that turned the tide."" Yesterday both Prof Whitty and Sir Patrick insisted current infections justify a second lockdown to prevent the NHS being overwhelmed. They said the tier system was not working fast enough to stop wards from becoming dangerously full. Although cases are falling among the young, spread is continuing in vulnerable older groups. Figures yesterday revealed that 397 people had died with the virus in the previous 24 hours — the highest daily figure since May. However, they struck an optimistic note, saying Britain is set for a brighter spring with Covid vaccines, new treatments and rapid tests all within sight. Prof Whitty told MPs the situation will ""steadily get better"" from early next year. He said: ""Anyone who thinks about this would be very confident that over the next year, probably even sooner than that, you will have multiple shots on goal from science. ""There will be a rolling through of the extraordinary scientific effort that is currently going on. ""So I am very confident we will get medical countermeasures. What we have to do is hold the line until that point."" He also said there is a realistic chance England would be released from the lockdown after four weeks. Sir Patrick added there is ""concrete"" progress, with new treatments, better testing and potential vaccines all showing promise. It comes as GPs were put on standby to start rolling out a potential Covid vaccine from the beginning of December. Family doctors are set to be told by health bosses to get ready to begin vaccinating over-85s and frontline workers from early next month, according to GP magazine Pulse. Data also shows the R rate — the number of people each infected person infects — has fallen to 1, meaning the transmission has levelled out."
510,510,The Sun,Harry ColeSascha O'Sullivan,"UK terror threat level to be moved to ‘severe’ meaning attack is ‘highly likely’ after Vienna, Paris and Nice atrocities","BRITAIN'S terror threat level is to be raised to SEVERE after a string of terror attacks in Europe, The Sun can reveal. It means it is ""highly likely"" there could be an attack on British soil after attacks in the continent happened on the eve of lockdowns in France and Austria. Priti Patel confirmed the news this afternoon. She said: ""The Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre has changed the UK terror threat level from substantial to severe. ""This is a precautionary measure and is not based on any specific threat. ""The public should not be alarmed this is a precautionary measures. ""(They should) continue to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the police."" Ms Patel said the decision to escalate the terror threat level was made in ""light of recent events in France and Austria"". The heightened terror status came just hours after Downing Street said the threat level was ""constantly under review."" And it means there will be an increased police presence on British streets as they patrol for anything suspicious. A senior security source said fears of a ""fresh wave"" of jihadi terror across Europe was behind the decision, expected to be unveiled by the Home Secretary today. And the intelligence insider said the timings of the European attacks ahead of national lockdowns had been ""noted."" The terror threat was lowered from the first time in two years down to 'substantial' in November 2019 - meaning an attack is ""likely"". The Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre has changed the UK terror threat level from substantial to severe. This is a precautionary measure and is not based on any specific threat. The public should continue to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the police. pic. twitter. com/XJa0gXetee Europe is on high alert after multiple attacks across France and Austria. Earlier this year, a man launched a bloody attack on people enjoying the sunshine in a Reading park as UK lockdown restrictions began to ease. And another man was shot dead in Streatham, South London, after he stabbed two people in what Scotland Yard described as a terror attack. Yesterday an ISIS supporter, armed with an assault rife and wearing a fake bomb vest, was shot dead after killing four people and injuring 22 others in Vienna. The attack unfolded just hours before Vienna was plunged into another lockdown to tackle the coronavirus crisis and the UK will be thrown into a national shutdown from Thursday. Attacks in France also unfolded just after President Emmanuel Macron announced national lockdown. France was victim to three separate horrifying attacks in Paris, Nice and Avignon last week. A school teacher in Paris was brutally beheaded by an islamist terrorist after he showed his students cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed. And a Tunisian migrant slit the throats of two people inside a church in Nice last week. Following the attack in Nice, the French terror level was raised to ""urgent"" - the highest possible alert. Paris has been rocked by multiple attacks following the furore of the controversial cartoons, and two people were stabbed outside the former headquarters of Charlie Hebdo, the magazine who published the cartoon, last month. Security analyst Will Geddes warned cities were more at risk before lockdown as extremists target unsuspecting people who are still on the streets. Mr Geddes, managing director ICP Group that advises on security threats around the world, said:""One of the biggest issues we have to remember is that terrorism is not very successful if there are empty streets, where there are less potential victims and it is easier for security services to identify them. ""Terrorists like to target highly populated areas, which there are less of when people are not on the streets as much. ""Where a country has implemented a lockdown it makes it far less appealing for terrorists to undertake attacks because it's not going to achieve the casualties and fatalities they want - as they have in Vienna and Nice."" In Avignon, southeastern France, a man reported to be a hard-right extremist was shot dead by police after he threatened people with a handgun."
511,511,The Sun,Natasha ClarkSascha O'SullivanHarry ColeKate Ferguson,Tory MPs savage Boris Johnson over second lockdown as businesses ‘face abyss’,"BORIS Johnson was hit by a barrage of criticism yesterday from businesses and his own mutinous backbenchers over his body blow second lockdown. After telling MPs they ""cannot pretend the way ahead is easy without painful choices for us all"", senior Tories accused him of turning Britain into an authoritative and coercive state. Business chiefs warned his four-week shutdown must be the last as it has ""been a body blow of devastating proportion for the economy"". The attacks on the PM came as figures showed daily infections had fallen to 18,950, the lowest level since Monday October 19 — amid suggestions Tier 3 restrictions in the North were already working. Some scientists and MPs claimed No10 might have jumped the gun with a second national shutdown. But Mr Johnson insisted there was no alternative to Lockdown 2. In a bid to see off a growing rebellion over his November shutdown, the PM pledged the country would escape the virus by spring through emerging technology. Yesterday, he passed his October target of half a million tests available a day, hailing it ""a considerable thing to have done"". He also vowed to give MPs a vote on the next steps when his four-week lockdown ends on December 2, to placate his raging party, insisting the restrictions were time-limited. But in a torrid 135-minute Commons grilling from 100 MPs, many Tories lined up to slam their leader. Powerful backbencher Charles Walker blasted: ""The people of this country will never forgive the political class for criminalising parents seeing their children and children seeing their parents."" Downing Street is battling to avoid the humiliation of seeing its 80-seat majority evaporate and the PM forced to rely on Labour votes to enforce his clampdown. But last night Government whips were confident they would spare Mr Johnson's blushes in tomorrow evening's vote, and rebel leaders admitted only about 15 Tories would defy the PM. But senior Tories led by backbench boss Sir Graham Brady and former Cabinet Ministers Sir Iain Duncan Smith and Esther McVey have vowed to vote against the lockdown and demand the science behind it be published in full. Tory MP Bob Seely asked for the data to be published ""so that people can start to understand and trust the information which is being put out"". Fellow Tory MP Philip Davies told the Commons: ""Can I just say to the Prime Minister that as a Conservative I don't believe that collapsing the economy is ever the right solution to any problem."" Meanwhile, CBI boss Carolyn Fairburn warned this lockdown must be the last or businesses would never recover. She told a digital conference yesterday: ""All eyes now ought to be on coming out in December. We have been absolutely clear that Lockdown 2 has been a body blow of devastating proportion for the economy — Lockdown 3, 4 and 5 would be even more so."" From Thursday non-essential businesses will be ordered shut, people will be banned from meeting others and everyone will be ordered again to work from home a dramatic ramping up of the rules. The PM stressed the country must avoid the ""medical and moral dilemma"" of the NHS being overwhelmed. He added: ""I cannot pretend that the way ahead is easy or without painful choice for us all."" But he promised a ""bright future ahead if we can make a success of these national measures"". The intention for the next four weeks is to stop the infection doubling and ""get that infection rate halving"", he said. He hoped that we can ""open up again in December, give people the chance to do some shopping... in the weeks leading up to Christmas and then beyond."" However, he warned it may not be possible to loosen some of the tough lockdown rules, comparing it to taking out ""one part of the Jenga block"". Ministers will announce which areas will move back to the Tiers system ""if any"" the week before the lockdown ends. And mass testing and ""the real prospect of a vaccine"" gave him hope that we can ""defeat the virus by the spring"". It came as: In a dramatic Commons showdown lasting for more than two hours, the PM warned if there was no second lockdown ""the sick would be turned away"" and people may not get the care they need. ""Doctors and nurses could be forced to choose which patients to treat - who would live and who would die."" Boris told MPs the restrictions were ""time limited and after four weeks they will expire"" and return to the Tier system - unless MPs renew them. But he fell of promising the rules will definitely be lifted at the end of the month as the country hopes. The PM vowed new rapid result tests would be rolled out in ""the next few days and weeks"" with the army brought in to help the distribution. It would allow pregnant women to have their partners beside them throughout births, and would allow ""testing [of] whole towns and even cities"". And he revealed that the self-employed support would double over the next month to 80 per cent of profits. Sir Keir Starmer today vowed Labour would support the new measures, meaning any Tory rebellion will likely be symbolic. He blasted the PM for his ""failure"" to lock down early enough, ignoring advice for 40 days. And he said: ""At every stage the Prime Minister has been too slow, behind the curve."" But furious Tory MPs insisted they couldn't support another lockdown which would harm lives and restrict the public's movements yet again. And they lined up to demand the full scientific and economic cost of a lockdown be published. Charles Walker MP said he couldn't back the PM's plans ""as we drift further into an authoritarian coercive state"". And the DUP's Sammy Wilson even compared him to appeasing Hitler at the  height of his rampage across Europe. He blasted: ""We were promised a Churchillian response to this virus but rather than a Churchillian response, we've had a response more like lord Halifax. ""This announcement today really is an announcement of defeat. ""We have surrendered our freedoms, we have surrendered our economy, we have driven people to despair with daily dose of doom laden data."" Sir Graham begged Boris to consider the ""enormous toll on people's mental and other aspects of their health"" before plunging the nation into another lockdown. We will get through this - but we must act now to contain the spread of coronavirus. It is my sincere hope and belief that by taking tough action now, we can allow families across the country to be together. pic. twitter. com/81yGUSYcB7 Former minister Esther McVey has said she would be voting against the measures. In a post on Instagram, she wrote: ""I will be voting against the new national lockdown on Wednesday when it comes before the House of Commons. ""The world cannot be put on hold, and the Government must stop pressing the pause and stop button for the whole nation on a whim, with all the disastrous effects this brings to our lives, livelihoods, health and relationships. ""The virus is here and we will be living with it for some time to come. We need to go about our daily lives whilst taking sensible precaution. Collapsing the economy is never a sensible solution to any problem."" I'll be voting against these latest lockdown measures when they come to the House on Wednesday Here's whyhttps://t. co/BwRyoEU2t4 1922 boss Sir Graham Brady said he was likely to vote against the new restrictions, warning of a ""mission creep"" of new rules. He told Radio 4 last night: ""If these kinds of measures were being taken in any totalitarian country around the world we would be denouncing it as a form of evil and here the removal of people's fundamental liberties is going almost without comment. ""And I think it is very important that we focus on those basic human rights and find ways, of course, to deal with the serious threat of Covid 19 but do it working with people rather than doing things to people."" And he attacked ministers for ""telling people who they are allowed to sleep with or not depending on whether they are deemed to be in an established relationship or not"" - an infringement of the nation's liberties. Peter Bone told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had not yet decided how to vote on the measures and would weigh up the evidence. Mr Bone said: ""At the moment, I have not been convinced that I should vote on Wednesday with the Government. ""But I'm going to listen."" Former Tory boss Iain Duncan Smith warned that if the data was wrong in some way ""we will have struck the wrong balance between saving lives and ruining lives"". Writing in the Daily Mail he said today: ""Make no mistake, the consequences – in terms of the human cost of closing hospitals to non-Covid patients, and the economic pain caused by the destruction of businesses – will be horrific."" Mr Duncan Smith warned he will need to be certain the data is ""fair and accurate before supporting such a drastic step as full lockdown"". He went on to blast the way the Government defended the Tiers policy before u-turning completely. It comes after scientists revealed a grim set of data over the weekend - warning the number of deaths could be double that of the last lockdown. And it was feared that deaths could reach into the thousands a day in weeks. However, the extreme data modelling is said to have been based on older information - which was already incorrect when it was revealed to the nation. Today Prof Andrew Hayward, professor of infectious diseases epidemiology at University College London defended the figures. And he claimed that thousands of lives would have been saved if the Government had imposed a two-week ""circuit-break"" lockdown when advised to by experts in September. He told Radio 4: ""I think if we had chosen a two-week circuit-break at that time we would definitely have saved thousands of lives. ""And, we would clearly have inflicted substantially less damage on our economy than the proposed four-week lockdown will do."" Meanwhile Scots Tory boss Douglas Ross attacked the PM for ruling out a national lockdown earlier. Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, he said: ""I've said that I don't think anything should have been ruled out and it probably was a mistake of the Prime Minister to rule out a national lockdown. ""Because if this virus has shown us anything it's that you can't rule anything out given the way it develops and how cases can go up and come back down again."""
512,512,The Sun,Harry ColePatrick gysin,Ministers and medics clash over second national lockdown as cops call for Christmas clarity,"MINISTERS and medics yesterday bickered over a second national lockdown as cops called for clarity to avoid festive chaos. Home Secretary Priti Patel said Boris Johnson would ""try everything in his power"" to avoid another crackdown. No10 is now considering a Tier 4 in which only schools and essential shops remain open and travel is limited to getting to work and classes. But scientific advisers want tougher national action. An attendee at the Government's Covid war committee said deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam had given an ""extremely bleak"" update on England's increasing infection rate. It came as figures showed 126,065 people tested positive for Covid-19 in the week to October 21 — up 23 per cent on the previous week. Dr Mike Tildesley, who sits on the Sage advisory group, said the current tier system was not working. He added: ""We need to move away from these regional firefighting techniques to try to move to something more national."" Sage member Sir Mark Walport — a former government chief scientific adviser — said a new lockdown was ""pretty likely with the way the numbers are going up''. Miriam Deakin, director of policy at NHS Providers, urged a ""tougher, quicker"" response to ease pressure on hospital bed occupancy. Prof David Nabarro, of the World Health Organisation, said action must be taken now to avoid a third national lockdown early next year. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said the PM firmly believed a short national ""circuit-breaker"" lockdown would be a mistake. He added: ""You can't have a stop-start country."" Ms Patel said the increasing figures meant the Government could ""rule nothing out"". She insisted ministers are focussed on stopping the spread of Covid. It came as revellers hit pubs in Nottinghamshire last night before it entered Tier 3 at a minute after midnight. Meanwhile, police chiefs warned of Christmas ""chaos"" unless Whitehall keeps forces in the picture. Northumbria's Police and Crime Commissioner Kim McGuinness said: ""We want to know things early. We need to be talking before, during and after regulations. ""I don't want police forces to be painted as the Grinch that spoiled Christmas."""
513,513,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha Clark,"Tier 3 lockdown: All of England faces legal BAN on Christmas gatherings, gloomy medics warn","ALL of England will need to be under severe Tier 3 Covid restrictions by mid-December - cancelling family Christmas gatherings for millions, gloomy scientists have told ministers. It has dashed Boris Johnson's hopes of a Christmas reprieve from lockdown rules, as people in the higher lockdown areas can't mix between households indoors. The PM previously said he hoped to lift the rules so families could spend the holidays with loved ones, but this is looking less likely as the coronavirus figures continue to rise. Today a minister said the rule of six was likely to stay in place by Christmas across the country - and there would be extra rules in the higher tier areas too. And he refused to rule out more action later on as well - saying ""we think we have got the right approach for now."" It means that eight million people in England alone - and more in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - won't be able to go and stay with family and friends this Christmas because they wouldn't be allowed to meet indoors. A gathering of six people in the park might be all that's allowed for people living in the toughest lockdown areas on Christmas Day. Ex-Scottish Tory boss Ruth Davidson has demanded Nicola Sturgeon suspends her ban on household mixing for 48 hours in the highest tiers - so people won't be alone at Christmas. The news comes as: The Sun has learned that the latest government modelling overseen by chief scientist Sir Patrick Vallance shows more than 25,000 people will be in hospital with the virus by the end of November — higher than the spring peak. That is also more than double the 9,199 who were battling the bug in hospital yesterday. It comes as officials predict the second Covid wave could be even deadlier than the first, with a ""lower but longer peak"". No10 assumes the death toll this winter is going to be worse than that experienced by the UK in the spring. And yesterday, the UK recorded its highest daily coronavirus death toll since May, with a further 367 fatalities and another 22,885 cases confirmed. The number of deaths is the highest daily figure since May 27, when 422 were reported. On average, 200 coronavirus deaths have been reported every day in the UK over the past week. Sir Patrick had warned the Covid second wave would not hit that grim milestone until mid-November. It is understood that new modelling prepared by the scientific advisory committee shows a far starker picture than originally feared, with the whole country needing the toughest restrictions in December. A government source said: ""The latest Sage numbers are utterly bleak."" Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director of Public Health England, last night warned that the rising death toll from Covid-19 was likely to continue for some time. The PM is under pressure to host a four-way crunch summit to save Christmas amid fears that people WILL break the rules anyway to see their family. Leaders have demanded the PM bring the four nations of the UK together to come up with a new blueprint to allow people to spend the holiday period with their loved ones. Business Minister Nadhim Zahawi insisted that Tier 3 areas were subject to 28-day reviews but warned virus levels were still too high to begin relaxing any curbs. And Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson has backed the idea of a possible fourth tier of coronavirus restrictions if Tier 3 measures do not go far enough to halt the spread of Covid-19. The city is one of five northern locations currently under the strictest curbs. But Mr Anderson, whose brother Bill was one of 61 people to die with the virus in the city in one week, told the BBC he was not opposed to the introduction of ""tougher measures if necessary""."

The jibe was made on comedy radio show The Leak in which the Chancellor was also ridiculed over the release of a special coin celebrating Britain's diversity. Presenter Tom Price chuckled as comedian Leila Navabi accused Mr Sunak of ""not representing most brown people"". She went on to joke: ""Rishi Sunak represents a lot of things for us as a society, not least what Prince Charles would look like in brownface."" But last night, Mr Sunak's predecessor Sajid Javid told The Sun: ""It's the kind of thing I expect to hear from trolls on Twitter, not the BBC. ""The BBC should celebrate diversity, not sow division. I hope they think more carefully in future."" Mr Sunak, 40, was born in Hampshire to Indian Hindu parents and last week celebrated a new 50p piece inscribed with the message ""Diversity Built Britain"". But Navabi, 21, dismissed it as a ""vacuous grand gesture"" and ""virtue signalling"". The Leak, first broadcast on BBC Radio Wales, is still available to download. A BBC spokesman said: ""In this instance, we believe that the comedian, who was a guest on the programme, was suggesting that Prince Charles and the Chancellor have a passing resemblance."" The jibes follow days of online attacks on ex-banker Mr Sunak, who married into a wealthy steel dynasty. Senior Tories leapt to his defence, with Foreign Office Minister James Cleverly tweeting: ""The left really don't like us BAME people being successful, do they."""

The grim medical warnings are a fresh headache for Mr Johnson who is being put under huge pressure by his backbenchers to set out a clear path out of lockdown for those regions currently in Tier 3, predominantly in the North. More than eight million people in England will be under the most stringent restrictions by the end of the week amid fears West Yorkshire is next. Nottingham is due to face the stringent measures tomorrow. Tier 3 means people are banned from household mixing - and people wouldn't be able to spend Christmas with their loved ones unless they were already living together. Mr Johnson's close Tory ally Jake Berry now heads up a 50-strong grouping of Northern MPs who are demanding ""a clear road map"" for the region to relax rules. The MP said yesterday: ""Our constituents have been some of the hardest hit by this virus, with many losing jobs, businesses and livelihoods. ""Never has there been a more pertinent and urgent political and economic case to support people living in the North."" Mr Berry's new Northern Research Group insist they are trying to help the Prime Minister. One member, Barrow and Furness Conservative MP Simon Fell, told Times Radio they were ""trying to essentially keep the Government honest on its promises to the North"". He insisted they ""want to be a friendly and helpful voice"". But a Whitehall source told The Sun: ""The exit path these guys want does not exist yet.""

Researchers found three-quarters of young children spent more time watching TV or playing with a tablet due to Covid-19 restrictions. Youngsters from disadvantaged families were more likely to be staring at screens than reading books, exercising and doing other ""enriching activities"". The University of Oxford's Alex Hendry said: ""It is clear that during lockdown some babies have been missing out."" And Dr Nayeli Gonzalez-Gomez, of Oxford Brookes University, added: ""The closure of playgrounds and libraries has disproportionately impacted children from disadvantaged backgrounds. ""In the event of continued local lockdowns, it is vital that disadvantaged families are given extra support to promote children's early development."""
516,516,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor","Boris Johnson ‘hid in a bedroom’ to avoid having to talk to Iain Duncan Smith about Brexit, book claims","BORIS Johnson hid in a bedroom just days before he became PM to avoid having to talk to Sir Iain Duncan Smith about Brexit, an explosive new book claims. It says the soon-to-be Premier and his aides pretended not to be home while Sir Iain - who was meant to be chairing Mr Johnson's leadership campaign - banged on the front door unaware they had concealed themselves upstairs. A tell-all tome from former government spin doctor Peter Cardwell published today will pour petrol on testy relations between the PM and his senior backbenchers such as Sir Iain. Mr Cardwell lifts the lid on his long career in Whitehall serving as a bag carrier and media handler for a number of Cabinet Ministers before being brutally sacked last February. And he recalls in detail a ""farcical scene"" in July 2019 in the week before Mr Johnson was crowned Tory leader and PM in his book The Secret Life of Special Advisers published today. ""Boris quickly ordered his entire team to race up the stairs to the first floor of the house and, well, hide"" Sir Iain, a powerful backbench Brexit supporter and ex-Conservative leader himself, had been drafted into the campaign as chairman to help shore up mistrust of Mr Johnson by Tory MPs who thought he was ""wobbly"" on Brexit demands. But Mr Cardwell writes ""relations between chairman and candidate were not good."" ""IDS attempted to ring him several times to suggest they have a strategy discussion at the campaign's headquarters at the home of Andrew Griffith, a Sky executive who later worked in Downing Street and became an MP in December 2019."" But ""Boris ignored both calls and texts until finally IDS texted to say he was on his way round."" The book continues: ""With IDS en route, Boris quickly ordered his entire team to race up the stairs to the first floor of the house and, well, hide from their alleged campaign chairman as he rapped on the door of the building, demanding to be let in. ""Eventually, IDS gave up knocking on the door and ringing the bell, and the Johnson team gingerly made their way downstairs again to their makeshift offices to resume their work."" When approached by The Sun, Downing Street figures named in the book as being part of the hiding crew disputed Mr Cardwell's version of events. A senior Tory source said: ""It seems this book is more a work of fiction than an autobiography but we wish Peter well."" Mr Cardwell told The Sun ""that's what we in the trade would describe as not a denial."" Sir Iain Duncan Smith declined to comment."

Yesterday Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed ""a role for the armed forces"" in distributing the antidote. The Sun can reveal Health bosses have raised concerns anti-vaccine protests may target unprepared hospitals with mass demonstrations or even attempts to destroy stockpiles. NHS Trusts are liaising with Whitehall over a role for the police or even the Army in protecting the supply chains. Particular concern has been raised by the first hospitals in London that plan to begin vaccinating frontline health workers as soon as any vaccine is given the greenlight. A Whitehall source said: ""They are liaising with the police and even the army over a number of security concerns."" Yesterday Mr Hancock told the BBC: ""We're doing the logistical work - led by the NHS working with the armed services who are playing an important role in the logistics of it to ensure that we have that rollout programme ready."" Clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccines are ongoing. CORONAVIRUS  infections are falling in some of the worst-hit areas — offering hope that lockdown measures are working. The rate in Liverpool fell from 620 cases per 100,000 people to 520 in just a week — with 2,591 new cases in total. It was one of the first areas put under a Tier 3 lockdown. In Knowsley, Merseyside, also in Tier 3, the rate fell from 682 to 599, with 905 new cases. And the rate in Nottingham, which will go into Tier 3 on Thursday, fell from 726 to 464, with 1,546 new cases. Rates also decreased in Newcastle and Exeter. The Public Health England data, released yesterday, covers the seven days to October 22 and is based on laboratory tests. It comes as 102 more people died from the virus, bringing the total to 44,998. Cases continued to rise for most of the country, with a further 20,890 reported. It is too early to know if Tier 3 lockdowns in some areas, such as Manchester and South Yorkshire, have been effective in curbing the number of new cases."

The Home Secretary wishes to move responsibility for counter-espionage from the Met to the National Crime Agency. Britain's ""FBI"", formed in 2013, has long been eyed for a major expansion in powers. It is the result of the NCA impressing multiple Home Secretaries with a string of high-profile successes. It is feared that tens of thousands of spies and assets from hostile states are operating in the UK at any time. The concern is that the Met are struggling to keep tabs on the growing underworld. Relations with Russia and China have soured in the wake of the 2018 Salisbury Novichok poisoning and the fall-out from Covid-19 — plus the rumpus about Huawei 5G technology. The plan would likely cause a major row in law enforcement circles, but insiders insist it is at an ""early stage"". Fighting spying on Britain's streets could also set the NCA on a collision course with MI5, the intelligence agency that traditionally handles domestic threats. But a senior Home Office source said: ""Anything that can make the system more efficient is welcomed by the Home Secretary."" Foreign policy expert Dr Alan Mendoza said: ""Chinese and Russian spies have been operating in the UK for years, yet our current confused approach to policing has failed to see a single operative successfully prosecuted."" The head of the Henry Jackson Society think tank added: ""The NCA has shown themselves up to the task of taking on international organised crime. ""Handing them control of counter-intelligence policing shows that the Government is beginning to understand the scale of interference from China and Russia."" Last night the Home Office insisted that no formal decision had as yet been made."

The England and Manchester United star, whose petition calling for help has gained a million signatures, paid tribute to those donating food or fighting for change. He said: ""To all the local business owners, to the food bank volunteers, to the teachers, to the carers, to the campaigners, this is your moment. ""Our children have felt the warmth and the compassion of their community and I am grateful beyond words. ""We have proved that even when we have little, we still have something to give. I am truly humbled by what I have witnessed over the last couple of days, I couldn't be prouder to call Britain my home, and to call football my profession. ""To all of you climbing into bed tonight after a hard day supporting our most needy, I salute you. You are the real superstars. I'm in awe of you all. Thank you."" Premier League clubs such as Rashford's United and West Ham have joined shops, restaurants, firms and individuals in donating. United, in partnership with the Manchester United Foundation and the charity FareShare, will provide about 5,000 meals from the Old Trafford kitchens. And Hammers joint-owner David Sullivan is giving £25,000 of his cash to Rashford's Child Food Poverty Taskforce. Meanwhile, the under-fire PM confirmed a climbdown. Mr Johnson promised to ""make sure that we have no children who go hungry this winter . . . certainly as a result of any government inattention"". Touring a hospital in Reading, he said: ""I totally understand the issue of holiday hunger. We have to deal with it. The debate is how do you deal with it."" The PM pointed to extra cash the Treasury has given to councils and said Universal Credit was ""one of the best ways you can help families in this tough time"". His spokesman later hinted that Chancellor Rishi Sunak was likely to unveil extra support at a spending review next month. And The Sun understands ministers are putting together a package of additional funding for town halls, as well as a boosted programme of school holiday activities similar to summer camps. Mr Johnson ordered his MPs to vote against an extension to the free school meals scheme during this week's half-term and December's three week break. But Downing Street spent the weekend battling a growing revolt from senior Tories urging extra help for the 1.3million who qualify. Ex-minister George Freeman said: ""We can't be chucking money at people to Eat out to Help Out one minute and then look reluctant to spend money to prevent child malnutrition."" CONGRATULATIONS to Marcus Rashford MBE, whose brilliant campaign to alleviate child hunger over the school holidays has once again struck a chord. We know it will have been difficult for the Government to change its stance. And we accept that the issue is more complicated than some make out: in ordinary times, it's not sustainable to expect the state to feed every child. But these are not ordinary times. And parents struggling to put food on the table need help wherever they can get it. Boris is right to look for solutions. SUPERMARKETS as well as restaurant, pub and café chains are stepping up to the plate to provide free school meals to children in need this half-term. They agreed to help after thousands of small businesses and councils backed footballer Marcus Rashford's campaign to make sure no child goes hungry. With fast food giant McDonald's also pledging to give a million free meals, offers from other big chains have flooded in. Morrisons supermarkets are donating 15,000 lunch boxes which will be distributed to food banks. And its shops are selling Pick Up Packs, costing between £1 and £5, which will then be given to young people. The Co-op is providing £20 food vouchers to 5,000 vulnerable children. Vietnamese chain Pho will also dish out 50 servings of veggie fried rice and fresh fruit from its restaurants. Meanwhile, Asda has revealed it will spend almost £100,000 to provide families with access to food during the half-term break."

Health sources say staff at a major London hospital trust have been told to be ready to receive the first batches of the Oxford Astra-Zenica jab from ""week commencing the 2 November."" The vaccine is still in testing, but a major effort has been ordered to have the world-leading hospital ready to go as soon as it is given the green light. The Sun has learnt other clinical trials at the famous hospital have been paused as all resources go toward preparing to vaccinate thousands of doctors, nurses and other frontline staff. And extra security measures are being planned over fears of anti-vaccine protests and to protect the valuable stock. As it is likely to be one of the first hospitals in the world to begin vaccinating frontline health workers, there are fears it could be targeted and requires extra support. A Whitehall source said: ""They are liaising with the police and even the Army over a number of security concerns."" It comes as the Mail on Sunday reported the George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust, Warwickshire ""has been told to be prepared to start a Covid-19 staff vaccine programme in early December"". Further hope came as White House top medic Dr Anthony Fauci said: ""We will know whether a vaccine is safe and effective by the end of November, the beginning of December."" IT normally takes ten years to develop a vaccine from start to finish, to the point where you can start administering it to patients. But it looks like the brilliant Oxford team is nearly there already. As The Sun reveals today, London health chiefs are on standby to take deliveries of Covid vaccine stocks as early as next week. More proof that Britain is truly a world leader in medical science. He told the BBC: ""The question is, once you have a safe and effective vaccine, or more than one, how can you get it to the people who need it as quickly as possible?"" Last night the Health department said: ""The NHS has a tried and tested track record for delivering vaccination programmes and will work with existing partners across the healthcare system to ensure a Covid-19 vaccine can be deployed safely and effectively."" The spokesman added: ""A Covid-19 vaccine will only be deployed once it has been proven to be safe and effective through robust clinical trials and approved for use by the independent regulator."""

Ministers today unveil a new team of NHS super chefs to reform dire hospital food following a review led by the Great British Bake Off judge. Chef Prue, 80, vowed that the changes will make sure hospital food is ""delicious, nutritious and nicely presented"". She said: ""Food is not only important to health, but to morale."" Prue was among advisers who recommended upgraded kitchens and staff working overnight so a 24/7 service can be provided to all. This could range from a drink and snack in the early hours to hot meals for hungry new mums and patients after a long fast due to surgery. The review followed a deadly outbreak of listeriosis in hospitals last year — linked to pre-packed sandwiches and salads. It also said that better communication between dietitians and caterers could provide patients with the right meals for recovery and cut food waste. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""This impressive report shows the way to good hospital food for all — patients, staff and visitors."""
522,522,The Sun,Harry Cole,PM poised to U-turn as Tory MPs back Marcus Rashford’s plea to extend free school meals at Christmas,"MINISTERS yesterday hinted at a major climbdown over Marcus Rashford's plea to extend free school meals at Christmas. Boris Johnson was accused by those close to him of ""misreading the mood of Britain"" by rebuffing the footballer's campaign. Three powerful senior Tory MPs broke cover to demand a rethink. And they warned they would vote with Labour on giving vouchers to parents of the poorest kids during school holidays. Hailing the ""phenomenal"" campaign by the England striker, Cabinet minister Brandon Lewis indicated reforms may be worked out for the festive period. The Northern Ireland Secretary said: ""What we are looking to do is put in place the structure that means even in the school holidays children can get access to the food they need."" And he suggested ministers are studying how ""people who need that extra support, very targeted and very directly, can get that support"" from local councils. The Times also reported that the PM would look to increase funding for the poorest families during the Christmas holidays. Another minister said the PM is ""standing firm on the principle that there are broader and bigger reforms of child poverty required rather than another sticking plaster"". But he did not rule out helping children to eat outside term-time. The hints of a rowback came as Sir Bernard Jenkin, a Vote Leave sidekick of the Prime Minister, blasted No 10's handling of the dispute, saying: ""I think we have to admit that we have misunderstood the mood of the country here."" And he added: ""I think the Government will probably have to think again. ""Labour vowed to put the issue to another vote. Ex-Tory minister Tobias Ellwood said he was wrong to vote with the Government against a free school meals extension last week. Fellow former minister Tim Loughton warned Downing Street is making ""a mistake"" and he would vote with those calling for an extension next time. In a further blow to No 10, children's commissioner Anne Longfield accused Mr Johnson of treating the poorest children like Oliver Twist, adding she had been ""horrified and really disappointed"" by last week's vote. Mr Lewis insisted the PM had the ""right position"". But he finally heaped praise on hundreds of small businesses who have offered to feed children over this week's half-term. Manchester United's Rashford, 22, last week visited, with his mum Melanie, a FareShare site in Greater Manchester that helps combat food poverty. On Twitter he praised the media for helping to highlight support from firms."
523,523,The Sun,Harry Cole,Nearly two thirds of Brits say BBC’s TV licence fee should be reformed,"ALMOST two thirds of Brits say the TV Licence fee must be reformed and a third say the cash is spent ""unreasonably"", devastating new polling shows. In a major blow to BBC bosses who are fighting to protect their funding, one in six say they never watch the Beeb despite being made to pay for it, and only a quarter say they watch the BBC every day. Last year 26 million TV licences were sold producing £3.69billion for the BBC - but 121,000 were convicted for evasion. The polling, commissioned by campaigners ""Defund the BBC"" and conducted by Savanta ComRes, found that half of Brits believe you should not have to pay for the licence fee if you only watch non-BBC live television. Ministers are currently reviewing laws that say anyone who watches or records live TV or uses iPlayer without a TV licence is guilty of a criminal offence and could face a prison sentence. Younger adults aged 18-54 are significantly less likely than the over 55s to believe those that watch TV but never the BBC should have to pay for a Licence Fee. And the Brexit divide in Britain continues to reflect how people view the corporation. Those that voted in remain are significantly more likely to believe the Licence Fee should be preserved in its current form. And following a number of rows over anti-Brexit bias and attempts to censor Last Night of the Proms, 43 per cent of those polled said they did not believe the BBC reflects ""British values"". 2019 Labour voters and 2016 Remain voters are significantly more likely than their Conservative and Leave counterparts to believe that the BBC fairly reflects British values, the poll shows. And those that live in the Capital are more likely than Brits from almost every other part of the UK to believe that the BBC fairly reflects British values. Savanta ComRes interviewed 2,274 UK adults aged 18+ online between 16 and 19 October 2020. ""Defund the BBC"" campaign chief Rebecca Ryan told The Sun: ""This poll clearly demonstrates that the British public is overwhelmingly opposed to the Licence Fee in its current form. ""There are rightly serious concerns over the way that the Licence Fee is spent, particularly given the eye watering sums paid to certain BBC presenters."" She added: ""It is also extremely worrying that the BBC has alienated such huge swathes of British people who do not think it represents their values. ""Decriminalising the Licence Fee is just the first step to radical reform. The next move is to ensure the Licence Fee only covers BBC output."" Last night a BBC spokesman hit back: ""We know from wide-ranging research that 91% of UK adults use BBC television, radio or online every week and surveys consistently show that the Licence Fee is the public's preferred way of funding the BBC. That model is in place until at least 2027."" A POLL revealed by The Sun today proves what we've suspected for a while — the BBC is in deep, deep trouble. Almost two in three Brits say the TV licence fee must be reformed, a third say the cash is spent ""unreasonably'' — and one in six say they never even watch the Beeb. It's time Parliament listened to them. Decriminalising non-payment of the fee will be a start. But the Government should go further and revive its plan to fund the service with a subscription model. Media luvvies squeal at the thought: they think that scrapping the licence fee would kill the Beeb off. But they're wrong. A subscription model — in which ordinary viewers beyond London would have more stake than ever before in what shows they watch — would give tired old Auntie a new lease of life. The BBC will always be a beloved British institution. But to stay relevant, it must start reflecting the REAL modern Britain."
524,524,The Sun,Harry Cole,Families face £94 hit to household budgets unless Rishi Sunak drops plans to restore VAT on masks,"FAMILIES face a £94 hit to their household budgets unless Rishi Sunak drops plans to restore VAT on masks back at 20 per cent. Labour last night accused the Chancellor of slapping Brits with a ""mask tax"" after the Treasury refused to extend a VAT pause on PPE after the end of October. VAT at 20 per cent on masks and other vital equipment like disposable gloves will line their coffers to the tune of £85million a month. But over the next six months this would cost the average household nearly almost £4 a week. For a family of four – two adults and two teenagers – using disposable masks, that could mean spending an extra £94 over the next six months, Labour analysis claims. Mr Sunak had suspended VAT charges on PPE on May 1, and is currently refusing to extend it beyond the end of this month. Sources say the price of PPE has plummeted now as supply has caught up with the surge in demand, but Labour says it's unfair as wearing them is compulsory. A Treasury spokesman said: ""Our temporary zero-rate of VAT on PPE was designed to help sectors that cannot recover VAT on such goods due to their VAT exempt status, such as care homes."" ""Health have committed in the Winter Plan to provide free PPE for Covid-19 need to adult social care until March 2021 through their stockpile, ensuring a stable supply of PPE. The temporary zero-rate on PPE is therefore no longer required."" ""The relief was to ensure front line workers got the protection they needed & that remains our priority"" But shadow treasury minister James Murray hit back: ""It's unbelievable that the Government wants to introduce a mask tax in the middle of a pandemic. ""With Covid cases on the rise across the country, the government should be doing all it can to help people follow its own guidance to wear a mask, not ramping up the cost of buying one."" The Labour MP added: ""Families across the country are already struggling financially as a result of the crisis. The last thing they need is to be penalised for doing the right thing."" A recent poll by YouGov found three in 10 used disposable masks. A box of 20 single use face masks from Boots costs £12.99."
525,525,The Sun,Sascha O'SullivanHarry ColeJoseph Gamp,Marcus Rashford petition urging Government to give free school meals during half-term and Christmas holidays hits 250k,"MARCUS Rashford's petition demanding the government take action to end child poverty has broken 250,000 signatures in just TWO days. The footballer's parliamentary petition lobbies for food to be provided during all holidays and for free school meals to be provided to all families and households on Universal Credit. By 1.30pm today, the petition had the backing of quarter of a million people - with no signs of it slowing down. As with other parliamentary petitions, Rashford needs 100,000 signatures to spark a debate by MPs. The campaigning footie ace urged all Brits to sign up as ""whatever your feeling, opinion, or judgement, food poverty is never the child's fault."" Calling on more people to sign the petition, the England and Manchester United striker, 22, said: ""Let's prove to these 1.5 million vulnerable children that being British is something to be proud of."" The petition comes in reaction to Downing Street saying kids won't get free school meals over the half-term break and Christmas holidays. No10 has ignored Rashford's plea to extend the scheme which helped 1.5 million poor kids stay well fed during lockdown. During lockdown, the England star put massive pressure on Boris Johnson to help kids entitled to free school meals get vouchers worth £15 every week of half-term and the summer holidays. And Mr Rashford has been behind a fresh push to extend the vouchers for hungry kids during the October half-term and the Christmas holiday. But a Downing Street spokesperson said: ""We are in a different position now. ""It's not for schools to regularly provide food to pupils during the school holidays."" Mr Rashford slammed Downing Street's rejection on Twitter: ""Merry Christmas kids... ""It's also not for food banks to feed millions of British children but here we are. 250% increase in food poverty and rising... ""This is not going away anytime soon and neither am I..."" Senior Tory MP and Chairman of the Education Select Committee Robert Halfon said Mr Johnson and the Department for Education need to urgently reconsider the policy, warning soaring unemployment rates will leave kids hungry. He told The Sun: ""I would urge the Prime Minister and the Department for Education to reconsider this. ""We know that the Office for Budget Responsible have forecast over 13 per cent  rise in unemployment, making 336,500 more working adults food insecure. ""The Government are doing some good things, but there needs to be a long term plan for combatting child hunger, starting with free school meal vouchers during half-term and Christmas. He added: ""If the bean counters at the Department for Education are worried about finances - if you feed children properly, you increase education and life outcomes. ""The Government ends up saving a lot of money when they don't have to make other significant interventions."" Labour have also called on the Government to provide free school meals during the holidays until next spring. Shadow education secretary Kate Green said ""now is the time to act"" as she warned more than a million children could be left hungry over the school holidays due to the impact of the pandemic. Her party is giving the Government just 72 hours to extend the provision of free school meals during the holidays or it will force a vote by MPs. Ms Green said: ""Millions of families face the prospect of losing their livelihoods because the Government has lost control of the virus. ""Its sink-or-swim plans for support could leave more than one million children at risk of going hungry over the school holidays."" The petition comes just days after the millionaire Man Utd forward was given an MBE by the PM for his work tackling child food poverty. In England there are more than 1.5 million children who can for free school meals - making up about 15 per cent of state school kids. But Mr Rashford says that should be doubled. And he wants the scheme extended to cover the October half term holidays in the short run, but is leading a longer campaign to eradicate child hunger for good. His End Child Food Poverty movement has been backed by dozens of food firms, charities and celebs. Last night he said: ""In 2020, no child in the UK should be going to bed hungry, nor should they be sat in classrooms concerned about how their younger siblings are going to eat that day, or how they are going to access food come the holidays."" ""Right now, a generation who have already been penalised during this pandemic with lack of access to educational resources are now back in school struggling to concentrate due to worry and the sound of their rumbling stomachs."" He added: ""Let's protect our young. Let's wrap arms around each other and stand together to say that this is unacceptable, that we are united in protecting our children. ""Today, millions of children are finding themselves in the most vulnerable of environments and are beginning to question what it really means to be British. I'm calling on you all today to help me prove to them that being British is something to be proud of."" And actress Dame Emma Thompson backed his campaign saying: ""There is absolutely no need for any child to go hungry in the UK. ""The fact that they are and in increasing numbers suggests cracks in a broken food system that can and must be repaired as a matter of the utmost urgency. ""Apart from the moral duty we owe to children, this is a severe public health problem."" Readers can sign the petition here."
526,526,The Sun,Kate FergusonHarry ColeEllie CambridgeSascha O'Sullivan,Manchester lockdown: Boris Johnson warns more people will die of covid because Andy Burnham is resisting Tier 3,"BORIS Johnson has warned more Brits could die over Andy Burnham  resisting a Tier Three lockdown in Greater Manchester. The PM vowed to roll out 15-minute Covid tests to the city – if it accepts his clampdown. In a blistering attack, the PM said Manchester's hospitals are filling up with coronavirus patients as their Mayor shirks his responsibility. He told a No10 press conference: ""I urge the Mayor to reconsider and engage constructively. ""I cannot stress enough – time is of the essence. ""Each day that passes before action is taken means more people will go to hospital, more people will end up in intensive care, and tragically more people will die. ""Of course if agreement cannot be reached, I will need to intervene in order to protect Manchester's hospitals and to save the lives of Manchester's residents."" He warned England may be plunged back into the ""bad old days"" of a national lockdown if local leaders blocked his system of local restrictions. Turning the screw on Mr Burnham, the PM said his public health bosses will only get access to new tests if he accepts being moved into the ""very high"" alert level. Boris said: ""Over the next few weeks we will start distributing and trialling these tests across the country. ""We will make tests available to local directors of public health to help control localised outbreaks - handing more control from London to all parts of our country so that those on the ground can use the tools we give them as they think best. ""And I have instructed my team to ensure that Liverpool City Region, Lancashire, and any other areas which enter into the Very High alert level are immediately prioritised for those tests. ""This will make a big difference in how we protect people from this disease."" Mr Johnson had blasted the Mayor for a lack of ""leadership"" as their war of words exploded. The PM said this evening ""we have not reached a decision with Manchester"" but warned ""the national Government must reserve the right to step in"". ""(Bringing in new restrictions) are far from pain free and it means a difficult time for those in that great place of the country on top of the restrictions they've already had to endure. ""You called for more draconian measures - be in no doubt the Government stands ready to apply those measures as soon as we think they're necessary."" Mr Johnson revealed cases in the region are now at 690 cases per 100,000 for those aged between 16 to 29 year old, and have jumped to 224 cases per 100,000 for the most at-risk age group - the over 60s. And he warned the number of coronavirus patients in ICU beds are already 40 per cent of what they were at the height of the first wave. It comes as the R rate climbed up even higher today, reaching between 1.3 to 1.5 across the country. The PM scolded Labour politicians for demanding a national ""circuit breaker"" lockdown, saying ""closing businesses in Cornwall, where transmission is low, will not cut transmission in Manchester."" He tried to rekindle the spirit of national unity in the first lockdown, urging Brits to work together to stop coronavirus spreading across the country. And chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance issued his own warning to dithering local leaders, saying fast action was essential. ""These are horrendously difficult decisions and there are harms on both sides. ""From a purely epidemiological point of view, it is important to go quite fast on this, it is important to make sure you go hard enough to get the R below 1 and the sooner you do that the sooner you get this under control."" Mr Burnham and all 10 Greater Manchester council leaders later hit back, saying they are ""ready to meet at any time to try to agree a way forward"". ""We are not convinced that closing hospitality venues is the only way to protect hospitals,"" they said. ""We want to look at other measures such as reinstating shielding arrangements and introducing tougher instant closure powers on non-compliant pubs, restaurants, shops and other business premises. ""We firmly believe that protecting health is about more than controlling the virus and requires proper support for people whose lives would be severely affected by a Tier 3 lockdown. ""We do not believe that the current proposals provide adequate support and that is why we await further talks with the Government."" A spokesperson for Lancashire confirmed their deal with Downing Street this morning, meaning 1.5 million people will be slapped with further curbs. Ministers are understood to be giving the region an extra financial package worth as much as £42million as part of their deal to accept Tier 3 restrictions. Bars and pubs in Lancashire will have to close unless they can operate as restaurants. And casinos, bingo halls, bookmakers, betting shops, and soft play areas will also have to shut. But gyms will be allowed to stay open, unlike in Liverpool, where they have been forced to shut up shop. Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson has kicked up over the different rules, saying: ""Liverpool City Region has demanded immediate clarification on why Lancashire Gyms are allowed to stay open and Liverpools close."" Dominic Raab said it would be a ""last resort"" to force Manchester into further lockdown without their support as 11th hour talks over Mr Burnham's financial demands continued this morning. In a blistering attack on the Manchester mayor, Mr Raab accused him of trying to hold the Government ""over a barrel"" and said they'll keep powers to push Northern hotspots into lockdown ""in reserve"". A furious Mr Burnham rejected the Tier 3 plans yesterday, saying they were being used as ""canaries in the coal mine"" and jobs in the North were being ""sacrificed to save them elsewhere"". Earlier today the Foreign Secretary told Mr Burnham the Government wouldn't let him ""pull up the drawbridge"". Mr Raab told the BBC this morning: ""We'll hold in reserve the ability to (impose measures on Manchester). ""We've strived with every sinew to work with local authorities. We'd like to get there with Andy Burnham and with Manchester, and in most places talks are ongoing."" Ministers believe Mr Johnson's expected announcement today would isolate the Labour mayor - who refused to accept the high-risk area restrictions until he receives a bailout. Mr Burnham said he wanted an 80 per cent furlough scheme for all affected workers, 80 per cent income support for the self-employed and a proper compensation scheme for businesses in the event of a Tier 3 lockdown. It comes as: Mr Burnham issued a joint statement with Liverpool City mayor Steve Rotheram and North Tyne mayor Jamie Driscoll on the inadequacy of the Government's financial offer this morning. They said: ""The Government is claiming that the North is divided and only interested in getting what we can for our own region. ""That is simply not the case. We are all united in fighting for an 80% furlough scheme for all people affected by regional lockdowns wherever they are in the country. ""Paying two-thirds of salaries will not be enough to protect the jobs of thousands – it should at least match the 80% that was available under furlough, with the minimum wage as the minimum support."" Talks with the Northern leaders collapsed yesterday after health minister Helen Whately failed to bring local MPs on board with new restrictions. Mr Raab urged the mayor to put politics aside, saying: ""Andy Burnham is effectively trying to hold the Government over a barrel over money and over politics. ""When actually we need to take action, the cases are 470 cases per 100,000 so its very serious. ""There have been all sorts of discussions with Manchester."" Andy Burnham is effectively trying to hold the Government over a barrel over money and over politics. The Foreign Secretary warned the Government was not going to respond to ultimatums issued by the Mayor. ""If Andy Burnham is just pulling up the drawbridge and saying we're not going to proceed unless more money is coming in. ""We can't have a situation where Andy Burnham is saying unless you give us what you want, we're not going to follow the new rules."" New measures imposed on Manchester would see pubs close and prevent households from mixing even in gardens. Another 11 .5million Brits will be under draconian controls as London, much of Essex and large parts of the North are put into Tier Two restrictions. The latest measures in England, which will see half of the country in lockdown, sparked fury among Tory MPs who accused the PM of smuggling in a national lockdown by the back door. They believe Mr Johnson has sacrificed businesses in the capital to kill off claims he was punishing the North with a stricter lockdown. But last night No 10 angrily rejected the claim, warning the virus numbers are going the wrong way in the capital. In the North, Tories dramatically united with Labour in Manchester and Lancashire to defy a No 10 bid to slap them with even tougher restrictions yesterday. York, Chesterfield, Elmbridge in Surrey, Barrow-in-Furness, North East Derbyshire and Erewash in Derbyshire, will also all go into Tier Two from 12.01am tomorrow. People will be banned from meeting indoors anyone with whom they do not live. One ICU doctor in Manchester said leaders have to ""shut up"" and ""shut down now"" to stop the city's hospitals reaching breaking point as people keep dying from coronavirus. He told Sky News: ""Why don't these politicians get it? 24 hours on and we're still in the same position. Hospitals are filling up. ""Can't they just accept the deal and sort the money out later? People are dying. These local leaders need to shut up and shut down, now!"" It comes after the Health Secretary told leaders to put ""party politics aside"" and agree extra measures to control the virus. He said: ""We must act. The situation in the North West of England is severe. ""The number of cases is rising exponentially. The number of people in hospital with Covid has doubled in just the last 12 days."" As part of the onslaught of rhetoric from ministers, Mr Hancock yesterday  urged local leaders to ""set aside this party politics"" and ""work with us to put in place the measures that are needed in Greater Manchester, across the north west, so that we can deal with this virus and support people through it"". He told ITV News yesterday: ""This is a time for people to come together so that we can control this virus."" Mr Burnham launched a blistering attack on Downing Street's plans while flanked by fellow leaders in the city on Thursday. MPs, leaders and No10's talks broke down amid fire and fury as they failed to thrash out a financial deal for the region. The furious mayor said: ""The only certain thing to work is a national lockdown. ""The Government told us this morning it is unwilling to do that due to the damage it will do to the national economy and yet... they are willing to sacrifice jobs and businesses here to try and save them elsewhere."" Mr Burnham ended his fiery statement by adamantly saying: ""It won't work. ""It will level down the regions and make the recovery much harder. This is an important moment, Greater Manchester will stand firm. ""We are fighting back for fairness and for the health of our people in the broadest sense."" Around 1.5 million people living in the Liverpool City region are already in Tier 3. The Government ultimately has the power to make the decision regardless, but had wanted to ""take regional leaders"" with them when imposing Tier 2 and 3 measures. After making his furious position clear, Mr Burnham said: ""[It] is a decision for the Government. The ball is in their court, they will have to decide."" Amid tense discussions with ministers Lucy Powell, Labour MP for Manchester Central, said earlier there was ""unanimous fury"" over ""the process, the evidence base and the economic support"" offered. She argued Manchester has ""lived in tier two for weeks now and it has not worked"". Tory ministers also slammed the tough measures yesterday, with William Wragg, for Hazel Grove in south Manchester, saying: ""The meeting we had earlier today was entirely pointless and we may as well have talked to a wall quite frankly. ""The closure of hospitality will drive people into private dwellings where they will mix, we do not thank goodness live in a police state for that is the only way to police it. ""Can they please listen to common sense and think again?"" By Chris Green, MP for Bolton West LOCKDOWNS as a cure for coronavirus are worse than the disease. I have seen the misery they cause to people's mental and physical wellbeing plus livelihoods and businesses. That is why, with sadness, I've resigned from the Government. I've watched my constituents suffer as Bolton was placed under some of the toughest local restrictions — with pubs and restaurants allowed to serve takeaways only. The reduction in footfall on the high street has driven businesses under while others are on the brink of collapse. Yet all through these local restrictions, transmission rates went up and up and up. We will get through this crisis — but repeated lockdowns are not the solution."
527,527,The Sun,Harry ColeNick Gutteridge,EU leaders stick two fingers up at Boris Johnson’s demand to speed up Brexit trade talks,"EUROPEAN leaders stuck two fingers up at Boris Johnson's demand to speed up Brexit trade talks last night at a chaotic Brussels summit. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen had to rush out of the event after an hour due to a Covid scare. She went into self-isolation after one of her staff came down with the virus, but has tested negative herself. Britain's chief negotiator Lord Frost said he was ""disappointed"" after the gathering of the heads of the 27 EU member states provocatively refused the Prime Minister's plea. They instead ordered No10 to compromise to secure free flowing trade after Brexit. However, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier turned a blind eye to the orders and promised to ""speed up"" talks anyway, if Mr Johnson wants to carry on. He proposed two more weeks of negotiations in London and Brussels, insisting there are ""prospects of a deal"". During a day of sniping, French leader Emmanuel Macron insisted French fishermen would not be ""sacrificed"". He threatened to block a deal if his ""conditions"" are not met. Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney admitted the two sides remain ""miles apart"" on access to waters. Eurocrats say a pact must be struck by the end of the first week of November so it can be signed off at an EU summit in Berlin on the 16th."

529,529,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",French President Emmanuel Macron pinches Boris Johnson’s ‘Rule of Six’ to tackle Covid cases,"FRANCE'S Emmanuel Macron has pinched Boris Johnson's ""Rule of Six"" to battle soaring covid cases across the Channel. The French President unveiled his ""la regle c'est six maximum"" or ""the rule is six maximum"" slogan as he slapped a 9pm curfew on Paris and other cities. In a long prime time TV address to the French people on Wednesday night, Mr Macron said: ""When we invite friends to the house we shouldn't be more than six round the table."" ""In restaurants, we say no more than six people around the table,"" he added. ""As a maximum, in our private lives, we need to do this."" But eagle-eyed Brits quickly spotted it was a direct rip off of the British ""rule of six"" that Mr Johnson introduced last month to outlaws big groups meeting up. And it's not the first time Mr Macron has turned to Britain for inspiration for his virus tackling measures. In May, after Downing Street downgraded their order to Brits from ""stay at home"" to ""stay alert"", the French copied that too. Macron unveiled the ""restez prudents"" tagline, which roughly translates to ""stay cautious"". At the time Mr Johnson was widely criticised for the confusing slogan, but said he was ""interested"" to see that the French government adopt it shortly after. He told a No10 press conference: ""For those who think that the stay alert is not the right message, I think it is absolutely the right message for our country now."" And after quoting the French version of the slogan, he added: ""Which is, as I'm sure everybody knows, roughly the same sort of thing as our message and I think it's the right way to go."""
530,530,The Sun,Harry ColeNick Gutteridge,Germany warn France to back down on demands to fish UK waters or ‘get nothing’ in Brexit split,"GERMANY warned France last night to back down on demands to fish UK waters or ""get nothing"" in a major Brexit split. British negotiators agreed to carry on talking despite Boris Johnson's trade deal deadline set for today as the EU big beasts began to fracture on avoiding No Deal. Emmanual Macron was warned by German government figures that his hardline fishing demand risks talks collapsing and leaving the whole EU empty-handed. Berlin warned the French President that the entire bloc will see its boats shut out of UK waters and their quotas cut to ""zero"" if he doesn't compromise. A source close to Angela Merkel sounded the alarm ahead of EU leaders gathering in Brussels today for a crucial showdown on the state of the talks. A German government source said: ""Everybody knows if there's No Deal then the EU quota in British waters will be zero. Now it's 100."" And they revealed Mr Johnson told Ms Merkel in a recent call that ""significant difference is necessary"" after the UK leaves and while that was ""politically sensitive"" it was ""technically feasible"" for Germany. Mr Johnson is likely to give the green light after the gathering for negotiations to continue despite setting the summit as the deadline for a deal. His chief dealmaker David Frost believes a trade pact can still be clinched and will advise him to stick it out. But the PM demanded the EU shows more ambition during a video call with Brussels chiefs Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel last night. No 10 has been frustrated by Michel Barnier's lacklustre approach despite pledges from eurocrats to ""intensify"" the talks. The PM's spokesman accused the EU's chief negotiator of making things ""doubly difficult"" by refusing to discuss a draft text for a deal. He said: ""Some progress has been made but there are still differences with fisheries being the starkest."" A source close to the negotiations said the EU hadn't yet come to terms with the fact the UK will be an independent coastal state. But last night Paris was sticking to its hard line and threatened to block a deal over fishing. Europe minister Clement Beaune said: ""The British want their waters back and this, they believe, gives them leverage. ""But they forget that for everything else they are negotiating on, they have a lot more to ask than to offer."" France's foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said negotiations could now drag on until as late as November 15. He warned: ""As things currently stand, the hypothesis of a No Deal is a very real one, and also one that is unfortunately very likely today."" But in a further split, Germany's finance minister Olaf Scholz expressed confidence a deal will be thrashed out at the last minute in a further sign Mrs Merkel wants a compromise. He said: ""It is always the right way to discuss questions that are difficult up to the last moment. My experience is that sometimes in the last moment you will find a solution."""
531,531,The Sun,Harry ColeKate FergusonMatt Dathan,Half-term lockdown: Boris Johnson under pressure to order two-week ‘circuit breaker’ as N Ireland makes move today,"PM Boris Johnson was last night under increasing pressure to order a nationwide mini-lockdown - with a 60 per cent chance he will bring in the measure over half-term. Growing demands for a ""circuit breaker"" to tackle surging Covid cases came as Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for a   shutdown of up to three weeks. Scientists claim this could save thousands of lives. The PM has so far rejected warnings from his medical advisers that a major reset is required. But there is a growing belief in his inner circle that the move is inevitable. One close Cabinet colleague said last night there is a 60 per cent chance he will bring in the measure over half-term, which begins for many a week on Friday. It comes as Northern Ireland looks set to plunge into a four-week circuit breaker lockdown with schools, pubs and restaurants all to close. Schools will close for half of the four-week period while restaurants and bars will only be able to offer takeaways. Yesterday, it emerged the Sage advisory committee of government scientists told ministers the ""circuit breaker"" would put the march of the virus back by 28 days. But the PM refused to implement the draconian measures and unveiled his three-tier local lockdowns instead — with Liverpool immediately hit with the highest restrictions. It has sparked rebellion from members of Sage, with the director of the Wellcome Trust and member of the group Jeremy Farrar who urged the Government to bring in short, tough measures now, to prevent a long hard winter. Mr Farrar said on Twitter: ""The best time get ahead inevitable winter increase would have been >3wks ago, but 2nd-best time is now. ""Pandemic can still be controlled, transmission can be reduced, hospitalisations, pressure on NHS & tragically people dying can be prevented. ""But if we wait, the government will inevitably have to change course again in 4-6 weeks, but the longer they leave it the harsher restrictions will have to get and the longer they will need to be imposed."" Adding pressure to the PM, Labour's Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham is also demanding a circuit break. He warned putting the North into Tier Three restrictions would ""be a path to hardship for people, redundancies and business failure"". But No 10 last night said a ""gold command"" meeting will today be held to discuss if Greater Manchester and Lancashire should join Liverpool and be put on very high alert. The change would put the two areas into Tier Three, which would see 3,100 pubs and 475 gyms shut their doors. Mr Johnson's new hardline stance to use tiers to protect the economy over advice for a lockdown from the scientists had seen him showered with praise from senior Tories. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for pubs and restaurants to be closed across the nation and workers to stay at home for at least two weeks. Yet he was unable to say how he could guarantee the lockdown would not drag on longer if rates remained stubbornly high. And he could not say how much the draconian move would cost England's already shattered businesses. Boris accused Sir Keir of ""playing politics with the virus"". He told a private meeting of Tory MPs the Labour leader was ""careering around like a shopping trolly with a broken wheel"". Until yesterday, Labour had vowed ""constructive opposition"" in regard to the virus, promising to work with and support the Government's strategy. But last night that truce was dead. The Sun can reveal that some in Mr Johnson's Cabinet believe the PM will have to relent, but is concerned about the ""toxicity"" of another lockdown and was even looking for another name to call the temporary measure. It came as the daily death toll rose above 100 for first time in four months yesterday — taking the total to 43,018. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock — who wants more restrictions — made a tetchy defence of the Government's latest curbs. He told MPs: ""We're trying to protect, as much as is possible, education and protect, as much as is possible, work. ""Essentially that leaves socialising as the other part of life, of activity where people transmit the virus. ""And so it is therefore understandable that governments around the world and around this United Kingdom, governments of all different political persuasions, have all come to broadly the same conclusion that it is necessary to restrict socialising because that way we reduce the transmission with the least damage to education and the economy."" The PM was told by Sage last month that shutting universities would have more of an impact on reducing the spread of Covid than the combined effect of closing bars, pubs, restaurants and gyms. But Mr Johnson ignored their call and ploughed on with his three tiered virus response. Tory grandee and leading lockdown rebel Sir Graham Brady told The Sun: ""Boris should be congratulated on resisting moves to ever tighter restrictions. ""The lockdown earlier in the year was justified on the grounds that it ensured that NHS critical care capacity would not be overwhelmed. ""But since then we have seen that these kinds of restrictions carry a huge cost in terms of illness and lives lost to other things such as cancer going undiagnosed or untreated and a huge economic cost as well, with millions of jobs and many thousands of businesses threatened."" But addressing the PM directly yesterday, Sir Keir warned: ""You can't keep delaying this and come back to the House of Commons every few weeks with another plan that won't work. So act now. Break the cycle. BORIS Johnson has rightly refused to surrender control to the erratic scientists of Sage. Nor must he buckle to the immense pressure Labour's Sir Keir Starmer cynically piled on him yesterday. Sage and Starmer both now clamour for the new national lockdown every sane person previously considered catastrophic, unthinkable and unfair. For Sage it is the culmination of a long journey from complacency to panic. Starmer, meanwhile, knows the public backs sweeping restrictions — and that if Boris resists he can blame the PM for every new death, claiming they would have lived under Labour. And yet Labour, as ever, will accept no responsibility for the mass unemployment and deprivation their plan would cement in place. They are already blaming Chancellor Rishi Sunak for a ""1980s jobs crisis"" despite the unprecedented sums he has spent to minimise hardship. Their games are revolting and shameful. Yet it will take a PM of immense courage to resist the lockdown calls. Unlike Sage or Starmer, though, Boris has responsibilities to us all. Yes, to the old and sick, the most vulnerable to dying from Covid. But also to the overwhelming majority who aren't, and whose job may be lost, business bankrupted, family home repossessed. The first lockdown cost hundreds of thousands of jobs. A second will send unemployment rocketing towards four million: More firms destroyed, more families destitute, more ordinary people suffering physically and mentally. And there is no plan beyond the panic button Starmer and Sage long to press. Starmer wants a ""two to three-week"" lockdown. He doesn't even know exactly how long. Not long enough, in fact, to register significant falls in the daily tolls. But even if they did visibly decline, what then? Reopen the economy, watch them climb again, then lock down a THIRD time in the dead of winter? How would this cycle of doom ever end? With a vaccine not yet invented? With a mass-testing programme which exists only in Matt Hancock's dreams? Sage admits its lockdown would delay the virus's march just 28 days. What, then, is its point, given the cost? Boris has a monumental decision no one would envy. He is surrounded by a divided Cabinet, scientists covering their backsides and a devious, tribal Opposition hell-bent on deploying a grave national crisis for political advantage. He must try to take his time and somehow make the right call. ""If you do you will have the votes in the House of Commons. I can assure you of that. You don't need to balance the needs of your party against the national interest."" Meanwhile, Labour London Mayor Sadiq Khan was begging ministers to put the capital under stricter measures. But junior ministerial aide Chris Green quit the Government over local lockdown restrictions, saying Mr Johnson had gone too far."
532,532,The Sun,Harry ColeJonathan Reilly,Boris Johnson faces Beijing backlash as rebel Tories back China trade restrictions,"BORIS Johnson faces a major blow up with Beijing as rebel Tories spring restrictions on trade with China on the Government. Tory grandee Iain Duncan Smith says he has rebel backing to overhaul the Trade Bill so that high court judges can rule what counts as a genocide. It would mean UK law would trump the UN – where China has a veto. An amendment was added to the Trade Bill in the House of Lords on Monday which would ""nullify trade arrangements"" if a high court judge determined a genocide had taken place. China has been accused of exterminating and persecuting the Uyghur Muslim population in Xinjiang province – but governments across the globe have stopped short of branding their actions as genocide. Iain Duncan Smith told The Sun: ""I fully back it and I believe that there are a significant number of conservatives who back it. ""We have been arguing about this problem and we're now putting this in to stop any chance that we will have enhanced trade . ""I think this is the right thing to do. People are tired of the appalling brutality of the Chinese, particularly Chinese communist government but others as well when we shouldn't really be doing business with them."" An explanatory note on the bill adds: ""The purpose of this amendment is to nullify trade arrangements made under this Bill if the High Court of England makes a preliminary determination that they should be revoked on the ground that the proposed trade partner has perpetrated Genocide."""
533,533,The Sun,Harry ColeMatt DathanJonathan ReillyKate Ferguson,3-tier lockdown system: Boris Johnson faces attacks from all sides after splitting UK into coronavirus risk levels,"BORIS Johnson carved up Britain into three Covid risk categories last night — with 17million people in the two highest tiers. But Labour mayors refused to accept the toughest restrictions in a row over money while fellow Tories blasted the new rules as ""insane"". Meanwhile, his chief medic, Professor Chris Whitty, warned the plans might not go far enough. Unveiling his new system, Mr Johnson urged we ""must act now"" in a bid to avoid another national lockdown. He said dire virus numbers are ""flashing at us like dashboard warnings in a passenger jet"". Under the new plans, the highest-risk areas will get ""baseline restrictions"" with leaders urged to choose additional measures depending on local circumstances. From tomorrow, 1.5million on Merseyside will be on the very high risk Tier Three — where pubs, gyms and bookies will shut. Another 15.5million in the North West, North East and parts of the Midlands will be on Tier Two — high risk — with a ban on households mixing. These figures are flashing at us like dashboard warnings in a passenger jet. However the PM had wanted to place Manchester, other parts of the North West, the North East plus Yorkshire into Tier Three. But he was last night bogged down in a haggling over bailouts led by Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham. Promising no one ""will be left to fend for themselves"", the PM unveiled a billion-pound bailout package for affected councils. Last night he urged local leaders to get on board or have measures foisted on them from Westminster in the coming days. He said: ""We're still working with other local leaders to determine how best to tackle the resurgence of the virus in their areas but tackle it we will."" As another 50 Covid deaths were announced yesterday, Mr Johnson warned MPs any further delay would be ""unforgivable"". He added: ""If we can't get agreement, then clearly it is the duty of a national government to take the necessary action to protect the public and public health, and we will."" Speaking from No 10 later last night, the PM insisted he was taking a ""balanced approach"" between avoiding a second nationwide lockdown and letting the virus ""rip"". BORIS Johnson today announced his new plan to control the spread of coronavirus with a three-tier system. All areas in England, excluding those listed below, will be on the medium level. Very High Level Liverpool City Region High level: Cheshire: Greater Manchester Warrington Derbyshire Lancashire West Yorkshire South Yorkshire North East Tees Valley West Midlands Leicester Nottingham He said he could not support lifting all restrictions because ""all the maths is brutal, it would lead to too many fatalities"". Another national lockdown would ""do a great deal of extra harm to our economy"", he warned. The PM added: ""We don't want to go down that extreme route right now. We want to give these measures time to work."" But he appeared to clash with chief medical officer Professor Whitty over whether the Tier Three restrictions alone would be enough. The medic warned each Tier Three area must also have extra measures to match its specific challenges. He said: ""I am not confident and nor is anybody confident that the Tier Three proposals for the highest rates, if we did the absolute base case and nothing more, would be enough to get on top of it."" But minutes later Mr Johnson struck a more optimistic tone. He said: ""If we implement Tier Three properly in the way that it needs to be done then I do believe we can drive the R down in the way that we need to do."" England's top medic also took a pop at his critics, declaring: ""The idea we can do this without causing harm is an illusion. ""It is a balancing act between two harms: a harm for society and the economy on the one hand and a harm for health on the other."" London was placed in Tier One — medium risk — but Mayor Sadiq Khan warned it may be declared Tier Two ""within days"". He said: ""The virus is now spreading very quickly in every corner of London. The number of cases is rapidly increasing and all indicators are moving in the wrong direction."" He added: ""London is at 'medium' in the Government's new alert levels. ""However, Londoners should understand this could change very quickly — potentially even this week."" Northern leaders whose areas avoided the harshest measures were ""glad the Government listened"" after threatening legal action. It was led by Manchester mayor Andy Burnham who called for more help. He said: ""The PM must give all areas under restrictions full financial support. Anything less will see them levelled down."" Eight North East council leaders, including Nick Forbes in Newcastle and Graeme Miller in Sunderland expressed their relief at avoiding the harshest restrictions. But Sheffield City Region mayor Dan Jarvis said: ""Local leaders face a situation where we are left without the tools and resources to control the virus, until cases spiral to the 'very high' alert level."" The PM must give all areas under restrictions full financial support. The PM also came under attack from his own party, with newly appointed Conservative Baroness Morrissey branding the new restrictions ""insanity"". She said: ""Everybody is exhausted and dispirited and can see no end in sight. ""Instead of doubling down on a flawed strategy, the Government should be having a big rethink. ""After all, a popular definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and over again and expecting a different result."" Julian Knight, Tory MP for Solihull, slammed the government for plunging his area into Tier Two. He fumed: ""This decision has the potential to inflict untold damage on the hospitality sector. ""Making hospitality unviable by restricting the ability of households to mix, while not including those businesses in new support measures unless they're forced to close, would be the worst of all worlds."" Andy Street, West Midlands' Tory Mayor, stormed: ""The region was united, cross-party, in supporting the existing restrictions. ""We believed continuing these would have been the right call to protect people's lives and livelihoods."" THE Sun understands why Boris Johnson decided as he did. But his new ""Three Tiers"" system is not the sensible middle-ground he pretends. The other options were not just a ruinous, needless national lockdown — or recklessly ""letting the virus rip"". A simpler, saner idea is backed by The Sun and many scientists worldwide: That the old, sick and vulnerable be protected as best we can while allowing the rest, and our economy, to function normally through observing the basic anti-Covid measures we all know. That would be less destructive than wiping out pubs — and creating for now a yawning North-South divide. It would avoid too the chaos of imposing different curbs on different regions, then giving self-interested local politicians an effective veto. Boris's tiers, to ""simplify"" the rules, already look a mess. That said, we commend the PM for at least doing what he could not in March: Prioritising keeping schools, universities and most businesses open. And resisting even harsher restrictions of the sort his chief medic Chris Whitty effectively admits he wanted. There remains, though, an imbalance in the Government's thinking. Boris's scientists grimly unveil scary charts of rising Covid hospitalisations. Where is another, showing three million cancer patients missing out on screening since March to ""protect the NHS""? Or increasing depression among those barred from seeing friends and family? As the graph plotting Covid deaths flatlines, or inches up, where is the one showing unemployment soaring towards four million? Or bankruptcies and benefit claims rocketing? Or the £40billion-a-year tax rises predicted to be needed to pay off the debt? The scientists are weaponised to elicit support for only one side of the argument. And it works — the public back almost any level of lockdown, though we suspect that will change once joblessness hits levels unseen for decades. Our question for the PM remains this: What if his strategy DOES head off the apocalyptic outcomes predicted? Will restrictions be relaxed? And without a vaccine, which Boris concedes may never come, will they be reimposed again and again whenever cases rise? Is this how he expects us to live, for ever? He urged the Government to review it as soon as possible. Last night a snap poll from YouGov found that 40 per cent of Brits say the new Covid measures do not go far enough. Just 15 per cent believed they were too harsh. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said workers on minimum wage in Tier Three areas will get nearly 90 per cent of pay."
534,534,The Sun,Harry ColeAlex Winter,October half-term ‘circuit-breaker’ national lockdown ‘still on table’ if three-tier measures don’t slow Covid-19,"A 'CIRCUIT-breaker' national lockdown over October half-term is 'still on the table' if strict new three-tier measures don't slow the spread of coronavirus, a senior source has said. Boris Johnson is set to make a national address today - and he's expected to say that Liverpool will be the first area to go into the toughest third tier of shutdowns. Greater Manchester and parts of West Yorkshire are set to follow. However, the PM's colleagues in Cabinet believe the clampdown is a ""gamble"" to try and avoid shutting the whole country down for the half-term break. Mr Johnson has reaffirmed his commitment to avoiding a second national lockdown if possible. But as cases surge - particularly in the north-east and north-west - plans to shut pubs, bars and gyms in hotspots are set to be announced. Under the measures, only one household or bubble will be allowed to meet up indoors, and travel in or out of the affected area will be limited. As part of the measures, which could last for six months, restaurants, schools and universities will stay open. One senior minister told The Sun a so-called 'circuit breaker' national shutdown when kids aren't at school is ""still on the table"" - although this has been publicly denied. Suspicions were heightened in Westminster when a Commons holiday was hastily scheduled to coincide with schools being off later this month. A ""circuit breaker"" lockdown - which could be used if infection rates continue to rise over the next fortnight - would likely include bans on socialising with other households, and telling people not to use public transport unless it is essential. Health Secretary Matt Hancock last month refused to rule out a second national lockdown, although Mr Johnson previously said: ""I don't want to get into a second national lockdown at all, it is the last thing anybody wants."" A curfew on pubs and restaurants, forcing them to shut at 10pm, is already in place across the country. But today, stricter new measures are likely to be brought in for millions of people living in the north of England - including that Brits will be banned from staying overnight in virus hotspots for a month. Residents of any area deemed to be in the new ""very high"" top tier of Covid risk will not be allowed to leave their area for anything but essential travel and must return the same day. Households won't be able to mix either indoors or outdoors, and people in 'red zone' areas won't be allowed to travel outside of their area for anything but work, education or for health reasons, The Sun has learned. Pubs and bars will also close in those areas, but it is understood restaurants will be able to continue serving food until 10pm after a major backlash from regional leaders. The move has yet to be signed off by Boris Johnson, who will make a national address about the new three-tier lockdown today. However, one of the academics who demanded Britain go into lockdown in March has backed the plans for a shorter shutdown. Professor Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London predicted that 500,000 people would die in the UK back at the beginning of the pandemic in March. And he believes that if schools stay open, officials must then shut down pubs and restaurants for a fortnight to stem the rising tide of cases. Professor Ferguson warned: ""All the teenagers do transmit the virus and we don't yet know if we can control the virus with high schools open. ""If we want to keep schools open we have to reduce contact in other areas of society more."" He said he though measures such as the extended half-term ""circuit-breaker"" lockdown needed to be considered to stop the skyrocketing case numbers without disrupting kids' schooling. He has previously been accused of using dodgy modelling to come up with dramatic warnings of deaths from diseases such as swine flu. Liverpool is expected to be the first area to go into the strictest tier of new lockdown measures today Under the plan, it's understood: Meanwhile, one of the main medical advisers to the British Government has warned that the country is at a 'tipping point' in its battle with the pandemic. England's deputy chief medical officer, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, said in a statement that Brits are in a similar position to the one reached in March. And Professor Peter Horby, who heads up the Government's crucial New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, said the country was in a ""precarious position."" Asked directly if we faced a second national lockdown, he said: ""I think that's a possibility."" The PM will hold a COBRA meeting this morning to determine the exact rates at which the new tiers will kick. It's understood some virus hotspots in the south, including Exeter, could also be hit. MORE restrictions on hospitality and travel in the north of England will be the nail in the coffin for hundreds of struggling pubs and hotels. And where's the concrete proof that it will work? Yes, Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty has told MPs that he believes a ""significant proportion"" of exposure to coronavirus is happening in the hospitality sector, with very few transmissions taking place in the home. But his evidence — derived from contact tracing data at just 165 establishments — is hardly rock solid. And more recent NHS data suggests the opposite. In bringing councils into the loop on Track and Trace, Boris and his ministers have proved they're capable of responding to evidence and using common sense. Now, they must apply the same principles to lockdown restrictions. If it can be proved beyond reasonable doubt that shutting down huge swathes of the economy is the only way to keep the virus under control, then draconian measures can be justified. But as even the World Health Organisation is saying lockdowns should be avoided, we don't think conclusive proof will be forthcoming. And without it, the Government is making job-destroying, life-altering decisions off the back of conflicting, confused and flimsy evidence. The PM will then update MPs in the afternoon before addressing the nation in a press conference from Downing Street in the early evening flanked by the Chancellor. Daily Covid-19 cases across the UK have fallen by more than 2,000 in the past 24 hours as 12,872 test positive for the virus and 65 die. Cases have nearly tripled in the past two weeks — with a total of 603,716 people now having tested positive for coronavirus in Britain. But the number of new infections are less than half of the Government's 'doomsday graphic', which warned of 50,000 cases a day by mid-October."
535,535,The Sun,Harry ColeChloe Kerr,New 3-tier lockdown rules: Boris Johnson to ban overnight stays and non-essential travel in Covid hotspots,"OVERNIGHT stays will be forbidden in northern virus hotspots for four weeks, Boris Johnson will announce today. As well as the bed ban, residents can only leave the highest risk regions for essential travel such as work, education or health reasons, and must return that day. And anyone visiting the danger zones will be banned from staying overnight. Mr Johnson will announce his ""tiers for fears"" system today — with Tier Three the highest risk. Last night he told the Cabinet the nation stands at a ""critical juncture"" and more must be done to avoid triggering full lockdowns. Tier Three households will not be allowed to mix either indoors or outdoors. Pubs and bars will also close in those areas, but it is understood restaurants will continue serving food until 10pm following a major backlash from regional leaders. The restrictions are likely to hit Liverpool, Manchester and parts of Yorkshire from as early as today. They will be reviewed monthly. It comes as a senior Tory warned that Britain is back to where we were in March at the peak of the coronavirus outbreak and things may still get ""sh**** yet"". They told Politico: ""It's going to be really hard to stomach, it's going to go on for some time, and if people don't follow the rules then we may have to go further still. ""People in all areas of the country should be under no illusion, we are back to where we were in March, this is going to be sh** and it may get sh**** yet."" Brits enjoyed a ""last chance"" weekend of partying before Mr Johnson's new Covid crackdown. Thousands piled into pubs until the 10pm curfew then drank on outside. Revellers swarmed to London's Piccadilly Circus. They also packed streets in Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds and Newcastle — likely to bear the brunt of the PM's toughest new measures. Shoppers also raced to buy Christmas presents before they faced local lockdowns. The PM sees his clampdown, to be unveiled this evening, as a gamble to avoid a nationwide ""circuit breaker"" shutdown over half term. That is still on the table according to one senior minister — although it was publicly denied today. Suspicions were heightened in Westminster when a Commons holiday was hastily scheduled to coincide with schools being off later this month. Meanwhile England's Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam warned the UK had reached a ""tipping point"" in the epidemic. He added: ""Earlier in the year, we were fighting a semi-invisible disease, about which we had little knowledge, and it seeded in the community at great speed. ""Now we know where it is and how to tackle it. Let's grasp this opportunity and prevent history from repeating."" This morning Mr Johnson will hold a Cobra meeting to determine the exact rates at which the three tiers — medium, high and very high — will kick in. The PM will update MPs in the afternoon before an evening briefing to the nation alongside Chancellor Rishi Sunak. Tier One — medium risk — will see current social distancing measures, the ""rule of six"" and a pub curfew of 10pm enforced. Areas in Tier Two will have the same restrictions plus a ban on households mixing. Only two households will be able to mix, and then only in gardens. In Tier Three ""very high"" risk areas overnight stays will be outlawed for residents and visitors. Pubs and bars will be required to close and no household mixing will be allowed for socialising either indoors or outdoors. Tier Three gyms and leisure facilities are expected to close. But, after a furious backlash, restaurants are likely to be able to serve until 10pm but without booze. Liverpool, Manchester and parts of Yorkshire are on red alert to be placed in Tier Three, possibly with Exeter in the South. Teesside's Tory mayor Ben Houchen told locals tonight: ""No overnight stays will be allowed outside of the Tier Three restricted area, and no overnight stays will be allowed within the restricted area for those living outside it. ""Travel will only be allowed outside the Tier Three area for essential reasons, but schools, colleges and retail will all remain open."" Mr Houchen urged Mr Sunak to extend support for firms forced to shut to Tier Two businesses. He added: ""Many of the fantastic hospitality businesses we have in our region will not be eligible for this new support as the rules will not legally require them to close. ""But due to a ban on households mixing, they will suffer a significant fall in customers and trade."" Ministers were keen to stress ""no one is punishing the North"" after a backlash from city mayors. Housing boss Robert Jenrick insisted the clampdown would be universal and set by infection rates rather than regionally. But experts warned hospitals in the North East and North West are close to breaking point. Professor Peter Horby, of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said: ""We have a doubling time of about eight to 15 days so it is not long before those ICU beds could be full."" He admitted a second national lockdown was a possibility. Tonight Downing Street said: ""This is a critical juncture and it is absolutely vital that everyone follows the guidance to help contain the virus."""
536,536,The Sun,Harry Cole,Nicola Sturgeon claims Alex Salmond may have wanted her to ‘cover up’ sexual misconduct claims,"SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon was in open war with predecessor Alex Salmond after she read texts on TV on Sunday. Scotland's First Minister said she thought he might have wanted her to cover up sexual misconduct claims. And, although he has been cleared of all criminal charges against him, she said: ""I think the reason perhaps he is angry with me is that I didn't cover it up. I didn't collude with him to make these allegations go away."" She read out the messages between the pair to Sophy Ridge on Sky News. Allies of Mr Salmond — her ex-mentor, who she hasn't spoken to for more than two years — had accused her of hiding the texts from a Scottish parliamentary probe into the claims. But a source close to Mr Salmond said: ""The First Minister is lashing out on TV about matters which should properly be dealt with in front of the parliamentary committee."" Scottish Tories asked: ""If Alex Salmond asked the First Minister to collude with her to cover up these allegations, shouldn't that have been reported to the government or police?"" Mr Salmond successfully sued the Scots government after it admitted its probe was tainted by bias. He was later cleared of sexually assaulting nine women while he was First Minister. A committee is looking into claims Ms Sturgeon broke ministerial rules by discussing the investigation with Mr Salmond."

The ex-PM has been asked by Boris Johnson to head up the COP21 climate change summit hosted by Britain next year. The global gathering of UN members is to be held in Glasgow next November after it was delayed because of Covid. Mrs May was reported by the Sunday Times to have not turned down the offer but has not yet signed up. But her supporters pointed to her declaration that the UK would be carbon free by 2050 in one of her last acts in No10. Currently business secretary Alok Sharma is in charge of the big event, but it is widely known Downing Street are seeking ""a big hitter"" to head it up. Last month the Government was criticised for the lack of female involvement in the summit after the SNP complained every current leading figure is male. Unlike her predecessors David Cameron and Tony Blair, Mrs May has vowed to continue to serve as an MP for her Maidenhead seat after quitting No10. She has emerged as one of Mr Johnson's most vocal critics, lashing out recently against new housing reforms and Mr Johnson's threat to break international law to rip up last year's Brexit divorce bill."
538,538,The Sun,Harry Cole,Iain Duncan Smith says Government should unleash £460m benefit reform in wake of Covid,"A SECOND phase of benefit reform should be unleashed in the wake of coronavirus, the architect of Universal Credit declared tonight. The £460million Universal Support scheme would help tackle the scourge of drug and alcohol abuse, mental illness and homelessness that stop people finding work, according to Iain Duncan Smith. The former Tory Cabinet Minister says the Town Hall-led and charity-run project would soften the impact of job losses sparked by the virus. As Pensions Secretary between 2010 and 2016, Sir Iain pioneered the benefit reform that streamlined welfare into a single monthly payment. Now, he is backing a report published today by the Centre for Social Justice aimed at helping welfare claimants ""tackle barriers to personal progress"" by ""bolstering people's economic, physical, mental and social wellbeing"". The taxpayer would fund councils to organise charity efforts to turn around the lives of society's most disadvantaged. Sir Iain said: ""We need to bring in a programme of personal support to help those most likely to fall by the wayside as the recession bites over the winter."" CSJ boss Andy Cook added: ""Britain is facing the prospect of a jobless tsunami at the end of October. ""Our proposals are a very significant step towards addressing that crisis."" The DWP said: ""We are committed to supporting the most vulnerable in society, which is why we spend over £95billion a year on the benefits system."""

Hundreds of key workers — including nurses, supermarket staff, delivery drivers and volunteers — are among those who receive gongs for selfless deeds. This year's list was postponed from June in order to include people, such as medical workers, fundraisers and volunteers, who have been instrumental in the Covid-19 effort. It celebrates the selfless good deeds of big names as well as ordinary people during the pandemic, which saw delivery drivers drop off food and medicine to vulnerable people and health and care workers put themselves at risk to help their communities and beyond. Lynne Grieves, 57, is one of 41 nurses and midwives honoured. The registered nurse moved into Northlea Court care home in Cramlington, Northumberland, in early April and stayed for 12 weeks — even celebrating her birthday there. She wanted to be on hand, but could not risk taking the virus back home to her mum Ann, 82. Lynne, awarded a British Empire Medal, said: ""Everybody sacrificed so much but it was worth it."" Winsome Thomas, 57, a nurse at the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust for 21 years, is also awarded the BEM. And Cambridge nurse Ashleigh Linsdell, 30, founded a national movement to make PPE for front-line workers. She used her own money to buy fabric. In total, more than 70,000 volunteers helped make 1.2million items of PPE and a further million face coverings. Ashleigh said of being made an OBE: ""I cried when I found out. I had no idea how this would snowball."" Asda delivery driver Geoff Norris, who used his own car to take groceries to elderly and vulnerable customers on his days off, is awarded the BEM. Geoff, 53, from Wisbech, Cambs, said: ""I was shocked as hell, absolutely gobsmacked. ""There were a lot of people that were in need and scared and we just thought let's do something."" Penelope Bond decided to set up a network of volunteers writing letters to elderly care home residents called Letter to a Friend. She asked her local care home in Grantham, Lincolnshire, if the residents wanted to get personal letters. But the project snowballed and more than 150 care homes got sent 35,000 messages. She said: ""Care home residents are currently very much isolated, with no access to visitors so sending letters, poems and pictures is a way of trying to put a smile on their faces."" A 100-year-old man who raised thousands for Covid relief by walking 970 laps of his garden while fasting during Ramadan has been made an OBE. Dabirul Islam Choudhury raised more than £420,000 in Bow, East London. He said: ""I feel proud. I thank everybody from the bottom of my heart."" Restaurateur David Maguire, 62, has been made an MBE after giving out free meals to NHS workers and vulnerable people during lockdown in Glasgow. And Jay Flynn, who spent two years as a down and out on the streets of London, becomes an MBE after running an online virtual pub quiz during lockdown. Jay, 38, entertained half a million people from his living room. He said: ""I never thought I would achieve anything in my life. I'm blown away."" Last night, Boris Johnson said: ""This year's honours recipients are a testament to the sort of country we are — caring, compassionate and resolute in the face of a global pandemic. ""The hard work and dedication of these local, often unsung, heroes has helped carry us through."""

The England and Man United ace, 22, who forced ministers to feed 1.3 million of Britain's poorest kids over the summer holidays, is urging them to extend the scheme to cover the next half-term. Rashford said he was ""honoured and humbled"" to be awarded an MBE — and dedicated it to his mum Melanie. The young England striker is honoured in the Queen's birthday list for services to vulnerable children. When schools were forced to close because of Covid, the poorest children had their free school meals extended — but ministers vowed to cut off this vital support over the summer holidays. A powerful letter from Marcus urging them to think again led dozens of MPs from all sides to back his cause and forced the Government into a major U-turn. Marcus is now urging Boris Johnson to extend the scheme for the upcoming half-term. The Manchester United ace said of his gong: ""I'm incredibly honoured and humbled. ""As a young black man from Wythenshawe, never did I think I would be accepting an MBE, never mind an MBE at the age of 22. ""This is a very special moment for myself and my family, but particularly my mum who is the real deserving recipient of the honour. ""The fight to protect our most vulnerable children is far from over. ""I would be doing my community, and the families I have met and spoken with, an injustice if I didn't use this opportunity to respectfully urge the Prime Minister, who recommended me for this honour, to support our children during the October half-term with an extension of the voucher scheme, as the furlough scheme comes to an end and we face increased unemployment. ""Another sticking plaster, but one that will give the parents of millions of children in the UK just one less thing to worry about. ""Let's stand together in saying that no children in the UK should be going to bed hungry. ""As I have said many times before, no matter your feeling or opinion, not having access to food is NEVER the child's fault."" Multi-millionaire Marcus has spoken before of how his own hunger pangs as a child were kept at bay by free school meals and how hard-working Melanie struggled to put food on the table at home. Tonight Tory MP Rob Halfon backed his call to extend the scheme, saying it should be paid for by the proceeds of the sugar tax. He added: ""I congratulate Marcus — he's a hero of our time."" Following the footballer's campaign in June, No10 announced the creation of a £120million ""Covid summer food fund"". Parents of the poorest kids were given a £15 food voucher each week to spend in supermarkets over the six-week holiday. Marcus also raised money for food poverty charity FareShare. He set a target of £100,000 but drummed up £20million to provide meals for around three million people. Elsewhere in the sporting world, former Olympic athlete and Great North Run founder Brendan Foster, 72, received a knighthood for services to international and national sport and culture in North East England. Ex-England cricketer and talkSPORT host Darren Gough is an MBE for services to the sport and charity, and ex-Wales rugby coach Warren Gatland is a CBE. UNSUNG heroes who stepped up during the Covid pandemic have dominated this year's Queen's Birthday Honours list. Hundreds of key workers — including nurses, supermarket staff, delivery drivers and volunteers — are among those who receive gongs for selfless deeds. Lynne Grieves, 57, is one of 41 nurses and midwives honoured. The registered nurse moved into Northlea Court care home in Cramlington, Northumberland, in early April and stayed for 12 weeks — even celebrating her birthday there. She wanted to be on hand, but could not risk taking the virus back home to her mum Ann, 82. Lynne, awarded a British Empire Medal, said: ""Everybody sacrificed so much but it was worth it."" Winsome Thomas, 57, a nurse at the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust for 21 years, is also awarded the BEM. Cambridge nurse Ashleigh Linsdell, 30, founded a national movement to make PPE for  front-line workers. She used her own money to buy fabric. In total, more than 70,000 volunteers helped make 1.2million items of PPE and a further million face coverings. Ashleigh said of being made an OBE: ""I cried when I found out. I had no idea how this would snowball."" Asda delivery driver Geoff Norris, who used his own car to take groceries to elderly and vulnerable customers on his days off, is awarded the BEM. Geoff, 53, from Wisbech, Cambs, said: ""I was shocked as hell, absolutely gobsmacked. ""There were a lot of people that were in need and scared and we just thought let's do something."" A 100-year-old man who raised thousands for Covid relief by walking 970 laps of his garden while fasting during Ramadan has been made an OBE. Dabirul Islam Choudhury raised more than £420,000 in Bow, East London. He said: ""I feel proud. I thank everybody from the bottom of my heart."" Restaurateur David Maguire, 62, has been made an MBE after giving out free meals to NHS workers and vulnerable people during lockdown in Glasgow. And Jay Flynn, who spent two years as a down and out on the streets of London, becomes an MBE after running an online virtual pub quiz during lockdown. Jay, 38, entertained half a million people from his living room. He said: ""I never thought I would achieve anything in my life. I'm blown away."" Tonight, Boris Johnson said: ""This year's honours recipients are a testament to the sort of country we are — caring, compassionate and resolute in the face of a global pandemic. ""The hard work and dedication of these local, often unsung, heroes has helped carry us through."" BILLIONAIRE brothers Mohsin and Zuber  Issa have landed a royal honour a week after bagging supermarket giant Asda in a £6.8billion deal. Mohsin, 49, and Zuber, 48, were made CBEs in the Queen's Birthday Honours list for services to business and charity. The brothers, children of immigrants from India, grew up in a modest terraced home in Blackburn. They began their EG Group, still based in the town, with one rented petrol station — and, 20 years later, have almost 6,000 forecourts in ten countries. Last week, the pair, who are building five mansions minutes from where they grew up, revealed they won the auction to buy Asda from Walmart. SEVEN members of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies have been recognised for services to the Covid-19 response. Professors Calum Semple, Graham Medley, Cath Noakes, Julia Gog, Lucy Yardley and Dr Gideon ""James"" Rubin are made OBEs, while Prof Andrew Morris becomes an MBE. Meanwhile, Prof Stephen Holgate, whose company Synairgen has developed an inhaled coronavirus treatment, received a knighthood. He said: ""It is wonderful that the dedication, imagination and courage of so many colleagues is now being recognised."" Prof Tim Spector, who runs the Covid Symptom Study app used by millions of Brits to track the progress of the virus, is being made an OBE. He said: ""It is great that the app has been given recognition in this way for its impact on Covid-19. This is an award for the whole team."" Emma Walmsley, chief executive of pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline, has been made a dame. She said: ""I'm humbled to receive this honour."" And Tory donor Tony Gallagher gets a knighthood for services to land development and the property business. BAKE Off star and national treasure Mary Berry becomes a dame. Mary, 85, said today she was ""absolutely overwhelmed"". She said: ""For most of my life, I have been lucky enough to follow my passion to teach cookery through books and the media. ""I wish my parents and brothers were here to share my joy, as my only achievement at school was one O level — in cookery of course. ""However, I'm sure they are looking down and smiling. I will celebrate with my husband and family."" Mary has written dozens of popular cookbooks and appeared on TV regularly since the early 1970s. She gained international stardom on the BBC's Great British Bake Off. SINGER Jeff Lynne, a star of supergroups Electric Light Orchestra  and the Traveling Wilburys, is made an OBE. The Birmingham-born producer founded ELO in 1970 with Roy Wood and Bev Bevan. They had hits including Mr Blue Sky and Telephone Line before folding in 1986. Two years later Lynne joined George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison and Tom Petty in the Wilburys. He has a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame and three Ivor Novello awards. The 72-year-old said: ""I'm extremely humbled and grateful to be awarded this honour for my services to music."" BREAKFAST TV star Lorraine Kelly has been made a CBE for her 36 years in broadcasting. The 60-year-old, who has remained a constant throughout the pandemic, said she was humbled by the recognition. She said: ""This is such an unexpected honour. I'm very grateful, particularly as I'm in far more deserving company, especially those front-line workers who are true heroes."" Sun columnist Lorraine first appeared on TV-AM in 1984 and has since become a breakfast TV fixture. She has presented her daily talk show Lorraine since 2010. She supports numerous charities including Help for Heroes and is the presenter of The Sun's annual Millies awards for the Armed Forces. Meanwhile, rapper Dizzee Rascal, 36, has been made an MBE. Dizzee, real name Dylan Mills, helped pioneer the grime genre with his Mercury Prize-winning 2003 debut album Boy in da Corner. Poirot actor David Suchet, 74, who played the detective for 24 years from 1989, will be knighted. And stars who helped the country get through the Covid-19 pandemic were honoured, including fitness heroes Joe Wicks and Mr Motivator. They were made MBEs for keeping people active with their online workouts."
541,541,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Millions of pounds worth of handouts for trade unions slashed by Gavin Williamson,"EDUCATION Secretary Gavin Williamson has enraged trade union chiefs by pulling the plug on a £12 million annual taxpayer handout. The Unionlearn scheme was set up in 1998 and claims to help train 250,000 workers every year in IT skills, maths and English. But ministers have told the Trade Union Congress that its public funding will be switched off from the end of this financial year. They insist the cash will instead go toward the Government's new £2.5 billion National Skills Fund unveiled by the Prime Minister last week as part of his pledge to give every adult without A-levels free college courses and loans to retrain. But union bosses are up in arms, claiming the move is totally unfair and are demanding urgent talks. In a letter to the TUC this week, The Sun understands that skills minister Gillian Keegan told General Secretary Frances O'Grady ""the decision is final."" Ms Keegan wrote: ""I appreciate this will not be welcome news for you, but it is important to emphasise that it is in the context of an overall commitment to supporting those in work to develop skills and to progress to more senior and productive roles."" But the TUC hit back to say ""Unionlearn provides learning and skills opportunities to a quarter of a million working people each year. ""The Prime Minister has been clear on the importance of skills to rebuilding the economy. Unionlearn should be recognised by ministers as a valuable national asset, with particular importance now for the nation's plans to build back better."" Last week Mr Johnson used a major speech to promise to train a generation of workers ""shaken"" by coronavirus. ""As the Chancellor has said, we cannot, alas, save every job. What we can do is give people the skills to find and create new and better jobs. ""So my message today is that at every stage of your life, this Government will help you get the skills you need. ""We're transforming the foundations of the skills system so that everyone has the chance to train and retrain."" The PM added: ""We're short of skilled construction workers and skilled mechanics, skilled engineers, short of hundreds of thousands of IT experts."""
542,542,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Priti Patel brands asylum system ‘broken’ after 20 migrants removed from deportation plane,"PRITI Patel lashed out at the ""broken asylum system"" today after 20 migrants were successfully removed from a deportation flight to Germany. The Home Secretary dispatched another handful of small boat migrants back to the Continent, but was hit by a flurry of last minute legal challenges from a score more. A immigration enforcement charter flight flew three Iranians, two Eritreans, an Iraqi and Kuwaiti back to Germany after they had successfully crossed the English Channel - two of them in September. Tuesday's flight also stopped in Hungary to deport five foreign criminals with a combined jail term of 20 years. Their crimes include robbery, class-A drug dealing, theft and possession of a knife. But once again the flight was bogged down in legal action that saw 20 scheduled deportees removed before wheels up. Ms Patel hit out today: ""As the issues we faced yesterday show, our asylum system is broken. That's why the new system I am introducing will be fairer and firmer. ""It will be compassionate towards those who need our help, welcoming people through safe and legal routes. ""But we will stop the exploitation of the broken system by those who come here illegally, asylum shop and make merit-less claims to remain."" The latest row came after Boris Johnson yesterday claimed Britain's border policing is ""hamstrung by what the Home Secretary would doubtless and rightly call the lefty human rights lawyers and other do-gooders."""
543,543,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson mulls decision to plunge millions in the North into tougher lockdown as Covid cases soar,"BORIS Johnson is grappling with the desperately difficult decision of whether to plunge millions in the North back into tougher lockdown. The Prime Minister offered a vision of hope yesterday but admitted Britain still faces one of history's ""darkest moments"" with Covid cases soaring again. He warned we must fight ""night and day to repel this virus"" but there is ""simply no reasonable alternative"" to restrictions. Pubs and restaurants face closure in Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle, with Chancellor Rishi Sunak scrambling to put together a local bailout package for businesses facing ruin. Some shops could also be forced to shut, but workplaces and schools would remain open. Mr Johnson's message came after Downing Street was hit with a ""white-faced briefing"" from senior medics about soaring virus numbers in the North West and North East. It prompted the PM to delay his plan to replace complex local lockdown rules with a simpler traffic light system. A No 10 source said: ""The numbers are going the wrong way, and there will come a point very soon where we simply have to do more."" Nationwide, the daily infection rate was 14,542 — up around 2,000 in 24 hours — with 76 deaths. The worst-hit area is Manchester, where 3,105 new cases were recorded in the seven days to October 3 — the equivalent of 561.6 per 100,000 people. That is up from 261.2 in the week before. Merseyside is next, with Knowsley and Liverpool both recording sharp rises over 500 per 100,000, followed by Newcastle upon Tyne. The UK-wide seven-day average rate stands at 125.7 cases per 100,000, up from 63.8 a week ago. Some 478 people were taken to hospital in England with Covid on Sunday, the most in four months, and up from 241 a week earlier. Alarm bells are also ringing across the North West about rising numbers admitted to hospital. The region saw 208 people admitted in one day on October 4, the highest single total since the end of April. Nationwide there were 2,833 patients in hospital with Covid on Tuesday, up from 1,881 a week earlier, and 393 on ventilators, compared with 259 seven days ago. But Northern Mayors have clubbed together to oppose new lockdown measures today - saying they are not working and the 10pm curfew is even counter-productive. The leaders of Leeds, Manchester and Newcastle city councils - Judith Blake, Sir Richard Leese and Nick Forbes - joined Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson to write to the Health Secretary to say they are ""extremely concerned"" with the rise in cases. ""The existing restrictions are not working, confusing for the public and some, like the 10pm rule, are counter-productive,"" the Labour politicians wrote. They called for additional powers to punish those who break rules, and for new restrictions to be developed by police, council and public health experts and for a locally-controlled test and trace system. They added: ""We want to be clear however that we do not support further economic lockdowns."" In his Tory party conference speech, Mr Johnson admitted: ""I have had more than enough of this disease that attacks not only human beings but so many of the greatest things about our country — our pubs, our clubs, our football, our theatre and all the gossipy gregariousness and love of human contact that drives the creativity of our economy."" He insisted that if we obey the rules the country will beat the virus ""just as this country has seen off every alien invader for the last thousand years"". Addressing the annual conference, which is being held virtually because of the pandemic, the PM appeared to suggest restrictions will be over by this time next year. He told party members that ""next time we meet it will be face to face and cheek by jowl, and we are working for the day when life will be back to normal"". However Mr Johnson is facing a growing rebellion from Tory MPs ahead of Commons votes to approve the 10pm pub curfew. Tonight 17 voted against a government motion approving the ""rule of six"" — with ex-ministers breaking cover to slam it. The rebels included former Cabinet minister Esther McVey, Tory grandee Sir Graham Brady and powerful committee bosses Huw Merriman and William Wragg. Labour also hinted they could stand against the curfew in a vote which may be held next week. Mr Johnson insisted he ""deeply regretted"" taking tough measures. The PM said: ""This government has been forced by the pandemic into erosions of liberty that we deeply regret and to an expansion in the role of the state from lockdown enforcement to the many bailouts and subsidies that go against our instincts. ""But we accept them because there is simply no reasonable alternative."" But former Tory Chancellor Norman Lamont said he feared Britain was turning into a ""nation of informers"". He told the House of Lords: ""It's one thing to report your neighbour if you see that he is building a bomb factory. ""If he is holding a barbecue for seven people are you really going to report him? ""I deplore any suggestion we should become a nation of informers like the old East Germany."""
544,544,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson to unleash green energy revolution with pledge to have wind powering every home within 10 years,"BORIS Johnson will reverse his 20 years of mocking wind power as he unleashes a ""gale force"" green energy revolution today. The PM will admit he got it wrong when he said offshore wind farms could not ""pull the skin off a rice pudding"" and pledge to have wind powering every home in the UK within ten years. Addressing the Conservative Party's virtual conference, Mr Johnson will say: ""Your kettle, your washing machine, your plug-in electric vehicle — the whole lot of them will get their juice cleanly and without guilt from the breezes that blow around these islands."" And he will promise £160million investment in the North and Scotland to build new specialist turbines off the coast. The investment will create about 2,000 construction jobs quickly, with possibly 60,000 more in the future. Mr Johnson will tell his party faithful: ""There is one area where we are progressing, quite literally, with gale force speed and that is the green economy. ""Our seas hold immense potential to power our homes. Now, as we build back better, we must build back greener."" And he will quote an article he wrote just seven years ago that poured scorn on green energy. Mr Johnson will joke: ""I remember how some people used to sneer at wind power. ""They forgot the history of this country. It was offshore wind that puffed the sails of Drake and Raleigh and Nelson, and propelled this country to greatness."""
545,545,The Sun,Harry ColeMatt Dathan,Rishi Sunak insists Eat Out scheme did NOT fuel Covid spike as he vows to fight second lockdown,"CHANCELLOR Rishi Sunak defended his Eat Out To Help Out scheme today — and revealed his frustration at the 10pm pub curfew. In an exclusive interview with The Sun, he bit back at claims that the popular cut-price meals deal fuelled a second wave of coronavirus. He insisted the scheme helped to save two million jobs and kick-start the economy. Mr Sunak, who is fighting for normality in the face of Covid, also branded the pub curfew ""frustrating"". He said: ""I don't think it's wrong for people to want to strive for normality and I don't think it's wrong for the Government to want that for people."" Batting away leadership talk, the Chancellor accepted his ""Dishy Rishi"" reputation makes him accessible to the public but insisted Boris Johnson was shouldering an ""extraordinary burden"" that would break most people. He attacked the PM's critics after weeks of speculation over whether the leader was still hampered by his own battle with Covid. Giving full-throttled support for his boss, Mr Sunak said ""behind that boundless optimism is a deep seriousness of purpose and a deep desire to get this right"". He said what the public did not see behind the scenes was Mr Johnson's ""deep conviction every day and concern for the well-being of British people. That's what I see him wrestling with in his head."" Mr Johnson, 56, dismissed claims he was suffering long-term effects of his brush with death in April as ""balderdash"" — insisting he was ""fit as several butchers' dogs"". Mr Sunak said the PM was making decisions about the virus fight ""that would break quite frankly most people"". Speaking in his study at No11, he said: ""I sit in these meetings, I see what he grapples with. I see all the same information and these are not easy decisions to make. RISHI Sunak has launched a passionate defence of his Eat Out To Help Out scheme amid claims it helped fuel a second wave of coronavirus. The Chancellor said his wildly popular half-price meals scheme helped to save two million jobs and kick-start the economy. But the Prime Minister admitted today it might have contributed to the return of the virus. Asked if he had any regrets, Mr Sunak said: ""No, no, no, no, definitely not. We had an industry that I care deeply about because of employment. It's over two million people."" And he pointed to low cases of second-wave Covid in the South West, claiming that region made the most use of the scheme. ""They are awful trade-offs, they're difficult decisions and he does it every single day driven entirely by this desire to protect people's well-being. ""The fact that he can do it and maintain that sense of optimism is extraordinary."" But the Chancellor warned his boss, friend and neighbour he was not a robot and he would not be silenced in the fight against future economy-crippling lockdowns. He said that the response to the virus must be viewed in the round and not merely on case numbers. I don't think it's wrong for people to want to strive for normality and I don't think it's wrong for the Government to want that for people. And he warned that a further lockdown would cripple not just the economy but society, too. Cementing his position as the leading hawk in the Cabinet against tougher clampdowns, Mr Sunak pleaded for ministers to strive for a return to normality in the face of the virus. And with Mr Johnson warning of a ""bumpy road ahead"" through to the New Year, Mr Sunak sounded caution at extreme measures for the sake of the long-term future of the country. He continued: ""Lockdowns obviously have a very strong economic impact, but they have an impact on many other things. ""We have to look at this all in the round and beating coronavirus is important and minimising the harm that it causes is important. ""But there are other things that are important. Kids not being in school for months . . . if university students' learning is impacted that's not a good thing. ""People not showing up for medical appointments because they're worried is not a good thing."" ""And obviously the economic impact on people's jobs and incomes and security is not a good thing. ""Having a difficult economy has an impact on both our ability to fund public services like the NHS but also on individual people's long-term health outcomes."" Mr Sunak saw off a move by doves in the Cabinet and top medics to close the hospitality sector last month as coronavirus cases in the UK began to creep up again. He told The Sun it was ""a good thing"" and spoke of his frustration at the 10pm curfew slapped on pubs and restaurants. He said: ""Of course it's frustrating. I know it's difficult and wish we didn't have to do these things."" And he admitted that ministers were split on the issue. Mr Sunak added: ""Our job is to debate policy and come to the right collective answer but the advice of our scientists was that this would make a difference and there we go. ""It's one of the measures that we put in place but, you know what, we haven't closed anything down and that is a good thing."" But he repeatedly stressed: ""Is it frustrating, right? Everyone is very frustrated and exhausted and tired about all of this."" THE Chancellor is a proud Southampton fan and vowed to stop football clubs going bust because of Covid. Talks with the Premier League over a lower league bailout have stalled. But Mr Sunak suggested the Government will help struggling clubs in the same way it helped theatres and the arts sector with a £1.6billion bailout. He said: ""I know how important football is to the local community. ""So rest assured, it is something that we are very committed to."" WHITE Van Man faces a double tax whammy after Rishi Sunak signalled he would end the fuel duty freeze and raise taxes for the self-employed. He insisted he had to find ways of paying for Covid and public services when grilled on whether he would put up fuel duty. But he stressed he cared about the cost of living and ""fuel is a big part of that"". His words suggest he will allow duty to rise in line with inflation in April increasing it by nearly 3p a litre — but defy Treasury officials who want it to go up by as much as 5p. Howard Cox, founder of FairFuelUK, warned it would lose Tory voters. Mr Sunak also refused to rule out hitting self-employed workers by upping their National Insurance contributions. Despite his concerns, Mr Sunak urged Brits to obey the rules, saying: ""No one likes doing these things, these are not fun things. ""You know we're doing them to try and nip this in the bud before it becomes a bigger problem later."" He also used his most personal interview since taking over at the Treasury in February to talk about his rollercoaster nine months. Everyone is very frustrated and exhausted and tired about all of this. He joked: ""I thought the hardest thing I would ever have to do was a Budget in three weeks. ""It was, like, 18 hours a day for three weeks straight and that felt like climbing Everest getting that done right, brand new to the job. It turned out that wasn't scaling Everest. ""It turned out you were just at the foot of another three mountains that you need to climb over the next three to four weeks."" He revealed his own family members were placed on his furlough scheme that saw one in three workers' pay picked up by the taxpayer at the peak of the crisis. He said while it was ""simply not possible to save every single job"" he tried to save as many as possible and provided a lot of support during a time of stress and worry. But Mr Sunak has put off the hardest part of the job — working out how to pay for it all with tax changes and more borrowing. A planned Budget for November has been pushed back until next year, amid a growing Tory revolt at choking off the country's first signs of recovery with tax rises. It was reported Mr Sunak wanted to rip up Tory manifesto commitments on not raising income tax or VAT as well as the triple lock on pensions. But the Chancellor is now promising to stick to 2019's election pledges. He also appeared to recommit to spending 0.7 per cent of Britain's output on international aid, despite widespread knowledge he wishes to scrap the legal commitment. Mr Sunak's interview came ahead of his speech to the virtual Conservative Party conference. He will blast Labour as being ""nowhere in this crisis"" and suggest they ""don't really understand the country they want to govern""."
546,546,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Britain and Brussels to begin secret Brexit trade talks dubbed ‘Le Submarine’ after major breakthrough,"BRITAIN and Brussels will next week begin two weeks of intense secret trade talks dubbed ""Le Submarine"" after a major breakthrough. Boris Johnson is to virtually meet EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen tomorrow to hammer out terms for the negotiations after both sides gave concessions on fishing and red tape. It comes after the UK offered a three-year transition on EU access to our waters. Brussels is said to have eased some of its ""more outrageous demands"" on binding the UK to post-Brexit rules on state aid. Ms von der Leyen said there were still concerns about the so-called ""level playing field rules"" designed to stop Brexit Britain undercutting the EU. But she added: ""Where there is a will there is a way. We should intensify negotiations because it's worth working hard on it."" German leader Angela Merkel said a recent UK-Norway deal on fishing gave fresh hope of similar agreement with Brussels. She said it ""shows that one can find ways to come to an agreement"". Mr Johnson said it was ""up to our friends and partners"" in the EU to avoid a No Deal. He said: ""They've done a deal with Canada of a kind we want, why shouldn't they do it with us? We're so near."" Britain's chief Brexit negotiator Lord Frost, who has held regular talks with his EU counterpart Michel Barnier, was more downbeat. He said ""outlines"" of a deal were ""visible"" but ""familiar differences"" were still to be overcome."
547,547,The Sun,Harry ColeMatt Dathan,Margaret Ferrier: SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon in cover-up scandal over ‘coronavirus-spreading’ MP,"SCOTS boss Nicola Sturgeon was tonight caught in a cover-up scandal over Covidiot MP Margaret Ferrier. It came as social media pics shared by the SNP's Ms Ferrier on Saturday — the day she had symptoms and took a test — emerged showing her at a leisure centre, salon and shop in her Rutherglen constituency. On Monday she took a train from Glasgow to London. Despite learning she had tested positive that evening, she returned to Scotland on Tuesday. Party leader Ms Sturgeon called it a ""flagrant and dangerous breach of the rules, possibly the worst imaginable"". But she is powerless to sack her pal who has been suspended by the party. Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross questioned the SNP's timeline, saying: ""The SNP say they only found out about any wrongdoing on Thursday. ""That means we're supposed to accept that the SNP found out Margaret Ferrier tested positive on Wednesday — and asked nothing. ""The SNP's timeline is full of holes."" The Met and Police Scotland are probing possible health rule breaches over her trips. She faces a £4,000 fine. On Monday night, Ms Ferrier had dinner with DUP MP Jim Shannon. He has tested negative but is isolating."
548,548,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson sends supportive text messages to Donald Trump after he tests positive for coronavirus,"COVID survivor Boris Johnson has been texting Donald Trump supportive messages after the President's shock virus diagnosis, The Sun can reveal. The Prime Minister,  who had a spell in intensive care with the disease in April, also expressed his best wishes to the White House publicly. He said: ""Well, obviously, I think we all want to send our best wishes to the president and the first lady, and I have done that this morning as you can imagine, and I'm sure that they will both stage a very strong recovery."" And The Sun understands he was quick to text Mr Trump when the news of his covid test result shocked the world on Friday morning. The message of solidarity came as Mr Johnson branded claims that he has not fully recovered from the disease ""sinister disinformation."" There have been growing whispers amongst MPs that the PM is still not fighting fit after his own brush with the virus earlier this year. But in an interview with the BBC, he batted away claims that he's not been ""the old Boris"" since nearly dying. The PM said he felt ""considerably better"" and, thanks to ""recent efforts"" he's about two stones lighter. And he said his top dieting tip was to simply ""eat less"" and ""take more exercise"". He added, ""that is one of the things we should all be doing to take the pressure off the NHS."" Meanwhile Welsh leader Mark Drakeford risked controversy after claiming Mr Trump's diagnosis ""is bound to make people in the United States wonder about the quality of the leadership they have been offered""."
549,549,The Sun,Harry ColeNick Gutteridge,Boris Johnson shrugs off EU’s threat to sue over plans to rip up key parts of Brexit divorce deal,"BORIS Johnson shrugged off a threat of legal action from Brussels over plans to rip up key parts of his Brexit divorce deal. The EU has accused Britain of acting in bad faith and began the process of suing over the PM's move to rewrite last year's Withdrawal Agreement. If found to be in breach of EU rules the UK could face a bill running into the hundreds of millions — but such action could take years to pursue. The legal threat comes after No10 ignored a midnight deadline set by Brussels to ditch controversial clauses from the Government's Internal Market Bill that would overwrite parts of the 2019 deal. EU bosses have been outraged by the incendiary legislation, which looks to rip up parts of the Irish border fix which Mr Johnson says would undermine the UK. Commission President Urseula Von De Leyen said: ""This draft bill is by its very nature a breach of the obligation of good faith laid down in the Withdrawal Agreement."" Downing Street were nonplussed by the legal action — pointing out there are currently 800 such active proceedings underway across the continent. Spain, Italy and even Germany have 200 such active cases against them, prompting ministers to dismiss yesterday's legal letter from the EU as trade ""negotiations posturing"". The UK is currently facing 33 such threats from Brussels, compared to Spain's 57, Italy's 49 and Germany's 47. It typically takes two years before legal action against the UK reaches euro judges in Luxembourg. And Brussels trade negotiator Michel Barnier has agreed with EU states to carry on with the trade talks even while suing the UK. A UK Government spokesman said ministers will examine Mrs von der Leyen's letter and respond ""in due course"". He added: ""We have clearly set out our reasons for introducing the measures related to Northern Ireland. ""We need to create a legal safety net to protect the integrity of the UK's internal market, ensure Ministers can always deliver on their obligations to Northern Ireland and protect the gains from the peace process."" The legal move was immediately backed by Ireland and France, which said the IM bill must be removed for trust to be restored in talks. French Europe minister Clement Beaune also said Paris will refuse to ratify any trade deal while the controversial parts of the bill are still in place. But Dutch PM Mark Rutte tried to cool the situation, saying the legal action was ""a necessary administrative step"" and not political threat."
550,550,The Sun,Harry Cole,New ‘three-tier’ coronavirus alert system from curfews to full lockdown on the way to ‘simplify’ the rules,"BORIS Johnson has ordered health chiefs to simplify complex local lockdown rules within days after widespread confusion. Echoing his streamlining of social mixing regulations into a simpler ""rule of six"" the PM wants to implement a new tier system for threat level as soon as possible. Officials are working around the clock to flesh out the clearer system after the PM and his ministers were humiliated on the airwaves over their own confusion at the rules that can vary town to town. Each threat level would have different restrictions linked to them, based on the number of local cases. Areas with around 100 cases per 100,000 would qualify for tier one status according to an early draft of the plan and see greater enforcement of social distancing and mask wearing. But if cases rose above that, such as in the North, then they would be classed as Tier 2 and see bans on household gatherings. If that failed to work, areas could hit Tier 3 and be placed in to a more extreme form of lockdown that could see pubs, restaurants and shops ordered to shut in order to keep schools and other workplaces open Last night the Department of Health insisted that no changes to the local lockdown measures were imminent, but Downing Street did not deny the plan. No10 insisted: ""We keep all of the measures which we put in place under review - if there is anything further to set out then we will do so to the House"". The move will allow some areas of the country currently hit by severe lockdown measures to be granted more freedom to mingle. Mr Johnson is expected to unveil the changes next week after signing them off with his Cabinet as soon as this weekend. It comes after another raft of local measures were brought in for Liverpool, Middlesbrough, Hartlepool & Warrington. Today's news means around 20 million people across the UK are now living under local lockdown restrictions. The Government has been criticised of having patchwork systems of local restrictions which no one can understand. Even Mr Johnson stumbled over what the rules were in the North East, after mixing with other households indoors and in pubs became illegal. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for a ""rapid review"" of the local lockdown strategy. Sir Keir said yesterday: ""One of the major problems, is widespread confusion about the local restrictions."" Conservative Bolton council leader David Greenhalgh, where restrictions were relaxed slightly today, said the rules have become ""too complex and too complicated""."
551,551,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Boris Johnson warns Brits ‘don’t throw in the sponge’ as he threatens second lockdown,"BORIS Johnson tonight warned Brits not to ""throw in the sponge"" at a critical moment in the pandemic. The PM caved in to a Tory rebellion and gave MPs the right to veto tougher virus rules. But he stood by his key advisers' gloomy forecasts and warned he would not hesitate to impose a second lockdown. And defying dozens of party critics, he insisted he would not soften measures and ""let the virus take its course"" as the death toll would be too high. Instead, Mr Johnson pleaded with everyone to show ""collective forbearance, commonsense and a willingness to make sacrifices for others"". He stressed: ""No matter how impatient, how fed up we may become, there is only one way of doing this."" He said if people did not comply and, if the evidence required it, he would quickly take further measures. No matter how impatient, how fed up we may become, there is only one way of doing this. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance added: ""We don't have this under control at the moment. There's no cause for complacency."" The warnings came as the UK saw 7,108 new cases — as well as 71 deaths for the second day running. Chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said hospital and intensive care figures were going in the wrong direction, adding: ""We've got a long winter ahead of us."" He singled out the North East, North West and London where there was a significant rise in people entering intensive care. There were 312 patients in mechanical ventilator beds as of Tuesday and 2,252 patients in hospital, as reported on Monday. Mr Johnson said: ""This remains a national threat and a national challenge. It's down to all of us."" But he warned he would ""bear down on the virus where we need to do that most"". In a dig at Tories demanding a softening of measures, the PM said: ""I know that some people think that we should give up and let the virus take its course, despite the huge loss of life that would potentially entail. ""But I profoundly disagree and I don't think it's what the British people want. ""I don't think they want to throw in the sponge. They want to fight and defeat this virus and this is what we're going to do."" This remains a national threat and a national challenge. It's down to all of us. In a glimmer of good news, Prof Whitty revealed that the reopening of schools was not having a major impact on spreading the virus. Mr Johnson, asked for his honest assessment of whether further nationwide restrictions were on the way, added: ""The answer is, I'm afraid, entirely dependent on how effective we are now in collectively driving down the virus. ""We know we can do it because we did it in March and April. ""What we hope is that if people obey the guidance in the way they can and have in the past we will get the spread down again. ""I'm confident we can do it. But our success will have to be judged in the days and weeks ahead. ""It is still too early to tell whether that package of measures will be successful."" His plea came after Government whips held tense talks with Tory rebels who rose up against further tough measures. Up to 100 party MPs were said to be ready to defeat tonight's extension of emergency Covid powers given to ministers in March. MPs demanded a say over future law changes amid fury over how the rule of six and pub clampdown were introduced without being voted on. Earlier, Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle told the Commons: ""The way in which the government has exercised its powers to make secondary legislation during this crisis has been totally unsatisfactory."" Tonight, Health Secretary Matt Hancock promised MPs a vote ""wherever possible"" before any new rules came into force. Sir Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 committee, had been pushing for MPs to have more of a say over restrictions. Tonight, he called off the rebellion, saying: ""Members on both sides understand the importance of ministers having the freedom to act quickly when it's necessary but we are grateful that ministers have understood the importance of proper scrutiny in Parliament."" IT was a mistake for the Prime Minister to introduce a slew of bewildering new Covid rules that not even his ministers could get their heads around. And digging his heels in now — in the face of enormous resistance from his own backbenchers and the public — is an even bigger risk. Brits were happy to trust the Government absolutely at the peak of lockdown, despite various missteps. But six months on, after lots of false promises, a string of U-turns and masses of evidence that the second wave is nowhere near as deadly as the first, the PM must know that goodwill is fast draining away. And that the harder he pushes, the more people will push back. Of course, we welcome news that Britain is on track to hit the 500,000 tests a day target by the end of October. Those extra tests will mean workers spend fewer days needlessly self-isolating, breathing life into British businesses. It's good to hear, too, that the new track and trace app has already been downloaded by 14million civic-minded Brits. We've known for months that a robust tracing system is the best way to beat the virus — so it's a relief to see it up and running. Despite these boosts, Boris needs to realise public confidence is wearing thin. He must work hard to win it back. Seven Tory MPs still voted against the motion. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""We've all got a duty to follow the Government rules. ""There has to be a national effort to prevent a second lockdown."""
552,552,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha Clark,Boris Johnson muddles Covid lockdown rules on mixing in North East & even HE can’t say if pub garden trips are OK,"BORIS Johnson was forced into a humiliating apology after getting muddled by his own Covid rules. The PM gave duff advice about the lockdown in the North East, seemingly confused at when and where he had outlawed boozing. Apologies, I misspoke today. In the North East, new rules mean you cannot meet people from different households in social settings indoors, including in pubs, restaurants and your home. You should also avoid socialising with other households outside. (1/2) And he got muddled over the 'rule of six' - wrongly saying it didn't apply outside. His gaffe came after a bungling minister made the same mistake — sparking calls from colleagues to ""get a grip or simplify what we are telling people"". The Sun also found the only UK pub legally allowed to serve after 10pm — a Wetherspoons on the M40 which has exploited a loophole. After a day of chaos and sniping from his MPs, Mr Johnson will restore weekly virus press conferences from No10 in a bid to quell growing confusion. Cabinet colleagues are privately urging him to undertake a total overhaul and simplify the overcomplicated rules that differ from town to town. Despite Merseyside and London being on red alert for more measures, the PM is not expected to unveil any fresh clampdown following his nationwide 10pm pub closures. But he will be joined by the Government's top medics Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance to address rocketing infection rates, with a further 7,143 daily cases and 71 deaths. Mr Johnson will also seek to dampen rising anger at the Government's mixed messaging after a speech descended into farce in Exeter. The PM tied himself in knots over complex laws that ban households from meeting in vast swathes of the North East. He also got muddled over the ""rule of six"", wrongly saying it did not apply to gatherings outside. Mr Johnson was later forced to clarify with a tweet saying ""apologies, I misspoke"" and confirming that people should avoid meeting other households in pub gardens in locked-down areas. However, it will not be against the law to do so, and people will not face fines — though it will be against official guidance. In parts of the North East, including Sunderland, Durham, Newcastle and Northumberland, people cannot pop around to a friend's for a cup of tea. Visiting parents for lunch in any public setting is also not allowed. Hours before the PM's gaffe, Skills Minister Gillian Keegan admitted she had no idea when and where people could meet up in the region during a car crash interview. She claimed she did ""not represent the North East"" as an explanation for not knowing. But No10 admonished her, saying the Government represented all parts of the UK — before the PM made the same mistake. Northern leaders branded the latest restrictions ""confusing"" while Labour blasted the ""incompetent"" Government. The new 10pm pub closures have also sparked town centre chaos across the country, with drinkers piling out of boozers to buy more at off-licences. Meanwhile, ministers were facing a huge rebellion over the Government's bungled use of sweeping Covid powers. Rebels claimed nearly one in four Tory MPs were ready to inflict the PM's first Commons defeat since last year's election. Ex-chief whip Mark Harper said as many as 100 could back an amendment by Sir Graham Brady demanding that MPs get a say over future Covid measures. Talks failed to broker a peace deal — teeing up a potential clash in the Commons. Current chief whip Mark Spencer will meet the rebels this morning in a final bid to avoid what would be a damaging loss. Ministers are reluctant to grant MPs a veto - arguing they need to act swiftly in the evolving crisis. They also fear giving any role to MPs could be used by Labour and other parties to tie the Government's hands. Ministers are believed to have offered rebels a compromise — giving MPs a retrospective vote after any new measures are introduced. But this is understood to have been rejected. Mr Harper told Times Radio: ""For me, the bottom line, and I think for many colleagues, is this idea of having to get Parliament's approval in advance, not afterwards."" A government source said that talks were ""ongoing""."
553,553,The Sun,Matt DathanHarry Cole,Ministers agree last-minute bailout for National League football to begin this Saturday,"MINISTERS have agreed a last minute bailout package for the fifth tier of English football to enable their season to start this Saturday. Emergency grants will be offered to clubs in the Vanarama National League to cover essential revenue lost from the lack of fans on the terraces. The start of the National League season was due to coincide with the return of fans this weekend, but it was put in doubt after the Government's decision to scrap the reopening of turnstiles due to the second Covid wave. That decision has threatened to bankrupt several clubs that play in the three National League divisions. But the Government has stepped in and last night agreed a rescue package believed to be worth a total of around £20 million. The money is believed to be in the form of grants rather than loans, which clubs warned would simply kick the looming crisis down the road. It will enable the season to start as planned on Saturday and will also prevent National League clubs being forced to drop out of the FA Cup ahead of the second qualifying round of matches this weekend. The three tiers are made up of the National League, with clubs relegated to the National League North and National League South. Clubs already crippled by the Covid crisis said they would not have been able to afford costs such as St John's ambulance, security and even floodlights that are needed to play games from this weekend. A senior government source told The Sun: ""These clubs are at the heart of communities across the country and we are determined to give them the support they need to get through winter."" The league is the lowest division in the English football pyramid played on a nationwide basis and was formerly known as the Football Conference. PREMIER League football clubs have refused to help out smaller cash-strapped teams. All 20 top-flight clubs held a video conference and heard EFL clubs could face financial run unless they stepped in. Teams in the Championship, League One and Two are all struggling. But ministers have now agreed a last-minute bailout package for the fifth tier of English football to enable their season to start this Saturday. Emergency grants will be offered to clubs in the Vanarama National League to cover revenue lost from the lack of fans on the terraces.

554,554,The Sun,Harry Cole,First British steaks to be exported to US since mad cow disease depart UK in £66m boost for farming industry,"THE first British steaks to be exported to America since the mad cow disease ban will leave for the United States today, The Sun can reveal. After Washington lifted their 24 year import ban on British meat in March, Northern Irish slaughterhouse Foyle Food Group have won the race for the first shipment. Their steaks and joints will depart from Londonderry for Philadelpia on Wednesday. The US market could be a £66 million boost to British farming over the next five years, with Trade boss Liz Truss calling today's shipment the ""tip of the iceberg"". She added: ""This is a historic moment for British farming. For too long our brilliant beef has been shut out of the world's largest consumer market. ""This could be just the tip of the iceberg. The free trade deal we are negotiating with the US will create a host of export opportunities for British agriculture. ""We are seeking an ambitious and high-standards agreement that benefits farmers and delivers for consumers."" Ms Truss is currently haggling with US counterparts to have crippling tariffs on UK beef that can be as high as 26 per cent. Last night beef boss Terry Acheson said: ""This is a significant development for Foyle Food Group & the British Farming industry. ""We are very proud to be leading the way as the first beef processor to export British beef to the US Market in 20 years. ""This opportunity will enable our farmers to showcase their prime quality beef to one of the largest consumer markets in the world."""
555,555,The Sun,Harry Cole,EU wants secret Brexit talks dubbed ‘Le Submarine’ but UK fears trap on fishing,"BRUSSELS have proposed intensive secret trade negotiations called ""Le Submarine"" - but Brits fear a trap on fishing. The super secret talks would allow both sides to hammer a trade deal with the EU over the line without the constant public sniping that has dominated so far. But UK negotiators are weary Brussels are trying to bounce Britain into last minute concessions or face being blamed for the ""submarine talks"" sinking. One UK source said ""obviously we are ready to up the pace but people are getting too over excited - there still is a long way to go and fish remains very tricky."" Tonight Downing Street played down the idea that a deal was imminent despite soaring hopes and end to talks was in sight. And the testy issue of future EU access to British fishing waters has not yet been solved. A spokesman said: ""The last two weeks have been relatively positive, but there remains much to be done. ""We are ready to work as hard as necessary to move things forward this week. Significant gaps remain but an agreement is still possible."" But they insisted they are not expecting a breakthrough before the next EU summit of leaders in mid-October. The latest war of words came as Ministers rebuffed a fresh demand from the EU to withdraw controversial legislation which could see the UK unilaterally tear up elements of last year's Brexit divorce deal. But Eurocrats tonight rowed back from their threat to pull the plug on trade talks over the PM's move to rewrite parts of the Irish border fix. Brussels bigwig Maros Sefcovic vowed the EU will never be the one to walk away from the negotiations as both sides looked to mend burnt bridges. And he admitted Wednesday's deadline he set No10 to pull parts of the Internal Market Bill that breach last year's deal will pass without action. But he also warned the bloc ""will not be shy"" over taking future legal action against the UK."
556,556,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha ClarkKate Ferguson,‘Red Wall’ Tory MPs demand no more Covid lockdowns as restrictions spread across north of England & 10pm curfew slammed,"BRITS partying in the street after the 10pm pub curfew have sparked a bitter war of words between MPs over lockdown restrictions. The ""Red Wall"" Tories in northern constituencies already in partial lockdowns are leading the charge against further tightening of measures. But Greater Manchester's mayor Andy Burnham called for the pub curfew to be extended to off-licences and shops — with a 9pm cut-off for those selling booze. The former Labour Cabinet minister said the pubs-only clampdown ""is doing more harm than good"". Thousands of drinkers partied in the streets of central London, Manchester, Birmingham, Cardiff, Leeds, Newcastle and Bristol after last orders on Saturday. Footage captured large groups mingling throughout the night, ignoring social distancing. Drunk revellers were seen crowding on to public transport after being forced out when venues pulled down the shutters. The wisdom of the restraints on pubs and restaurants was questioned as it emerged just 22 of 532 Covid outbreaks — 3.2 per cent — came from the hospitality sector last week. But Public Health England figures show schools and colleges accounted for 41.7 per cent of England's recorded outbreaks, a total of 222, while care homes recorded 25.2 per cent, at 134. Which clown-faced moron thought it would be a good idea to kick thousands of p***ed people out from the pubs into the street and on to the Tube at the same time? The remainder in the main came from offices and factories, which saw 19.2 per cent (102), and hospitals at 5.8 per cent (31). Yet half a dozen northern Tories broke cover on Monday night to demand no further sweeping lockdowns for their region in a fresh headache for Boris Johnson, who is already struggling to contain a Conservative Covid rebellion. One Tory MP was said to have raged: ""Which clown-faced moron thought it would be a good idea to kick thousands of p***ed people out from the pubs into the street and on to the Tube at the same time? ""It's like some sort of sick experiment to see if you can incubate a second wave."" The row came as the North East saw meet-ups between households in pubs and restaurants banned. Residents of Northumberland, North Tyneside, Newcastle, Gateshead, South Tyneside, Sunderland and County Durham have not been allowed for the past two weeks to socialise in homes. But council leaders in the North East asked for tougher legal measures to prevent households mixing. It means popping round for a cuppa in a lockdown area will result in a fine or criminal record, as could going to the pub for a pint with a pal. The new laws will come into force after midnight on Tuesday night, but they will not affect schools or offices that are Covid-secure. The move comes as cases in the region soared over 100 cases per 100,000. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs: ""We know a large number of infections are taking place in indoor settings outside the home. ""So, at the request of the local councils with whom we've been working closely, we will introduce legal restrictions on indoor mixing between households in any setting."" He insisted: ""We do not take these steps lightly, but we must take them because we know that swift action is more likely to bring the virus under control. ""The quicker we can get this virus under control, the quicker we will restore the freedoms we all enjoy in the North East and across the country."" But Tory MPs from Teesside fought off being included in the ban after slamming sweeping rules. The quicker we can get this virus under control, the quicker we will restore the freedoms we all enjoy in the North East and across the country. Middlesbrough's Simon Clarke, Jacob Young and Matt Vickers plus Darlington and Sedgefield MPs Peter Gibson and Paul Howell, demanded that ""wherever possible, restrictions should be targeted at a postcode level in response to risk"". Their letter stated ""deep reservations about proposals to ask the Government to impose further restrictions on residents"". But that plea put them at odds with Mr Burnham, who wants the lockdown to go even further. The Manchester mayor said: ""I received reports supermarkets were absolutely packed to the rafters with people gathering after 10pm. ""There needs to be an urgent review of emerging evidence from police forces. My feeling is this curfew is doing more harm than good. ""It creates an incentive for people to gather in the street or more probably to gather in the home. I don't think this has been fully thought through."" Mr Burnham was backed by Dr Flavio Toxvaerd, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Cambridge, who blasted the consequences of the new rule as ""completely predictable"". He said pubs should be open for longer with staggered leaving times, adding: ""Create a bottleneck and people will crowd together."" But Downing Street rejected calls to immediately review the 10pm curfew."
557,557,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson ‘under the spell of his Lord of the Rings-style Wormtongue advisers’,"FREEDOM loving Boris Johnson is under the ""spell"" of his gloomy Lord of the Rings' 'Wormtongue' advisers, one his biggest backers declared tonight. Brexiteer Steve Baker blasted the Prime Minister's reliance on top docs and aides, saying he needed to be ""woken up"" from a ""slumber"" and hinted others were pulling the strings. In what was seen as a direct attack on top No10 chief Dominic Cummings and chief medic Chris Whitty, Mr Baker invoked King Theoden from J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings who is put under a spell and controlled by an evil adviser. The former minister said: ""Many of us will have seen Lord of the Rings... Theoden the king is under the spell of his advisers, and he has to be woken up from that spell. When he wakes from that spell joy comes to pass in the kingdom."" He went on: ""And I am afraid at the moment somebody needs to wake Theoden from his slumber. When Theoden awakes, and I mean Boris, everything will come right."" Concerns were also raised by boss of the Commons defence committee Tobias Elwood, who said: ""You have to ask yourself do you have the right team to actually deal with this."" The blistering put downs came amid a growing rebellion on the Tory benches against Mr Johnson's plan to extend sweeping emergency powers to tackle coronavirus on Wednesday. More than 50 Tories have publicly slammed the proposal, although the Speaker of the Commons may dash their hopes of a formal showdown by not calling their planned protest amendment on Wednesday evening. Tonight Downing Street rejected Mr Baker's charge, saying Mr Johnson ""is responsible for all the decisions he takes as prime minister."" Tory former minister Sir Desmond Swayne called for Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance to be sacked as government advisers. He told the Commons: ""Less than a year ago, I celebrated what I thought was the election of a sceptical and liberal-conservative administration. ""And now I am left wondering if the Prime Minister hasn't been abducted by Dr Strangelove and reprogrammed by the Sage over to the dark side. The purpose of politicians is to impose a measure of proportion, a sense of proportion on science, and not to be enthralled to it. ""Now I will make myself very unpopular, but I believe that the appearance of the chiefs (chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance) last week should have been a sacking offence. ""When they presented that graph, with the caveat that it wasn't a prediction, but nevertheless it was clear that they presented it as a plausible scenario, with its 50,000 cases per day by mid-October based on the doubling of infections by the week. ""Not once, not on one day since March have there been infections on that day that were double that of the day of the week proceeding. Not once. Where did this doubling come from? What was their purpose in presenting such a graph? ""It was the purpose of the Fat Boy in Pickwick Papers, 'I wants to make yer flesh creep'. It was project fear, it was an attempt to terrify the British people, as if they haven't been terrified enough."""
558,558,The Sun,Nick ParkerHarry ColeJerome Starkey,Boris Johnson says the Poppy Appeal needs YOU ‘more than ever’ as he backs The Sun’s campaign to save it from Covid,"BORIS Johnson today saluted The Sun's poppy campaign, saying the need for this year's Covid-hit appeal is greater than ever. The PM's backing came after we revealed a third of Royal British Legion poppy sellers — 12,000 collectors — were forced to step down amid virus fears. Boris called on caring Brits to make sure brave service personnel do not face even greater hardship as we battle our invisible enemy. The PM said: ""While the circumstances in which this year's Poppy Appeal takes place are unlike anything we have seen before, the need for it is greater than ever. ""Online, by post or in person, let's all find a way to make our contribution."" Around 40,000 Legion supporters sell 40million poppies every year. But their ranks will be slashed this autumn because many are elderly and vulnerable to the virus. Those who brave Covid will be advised to wear a mask, sanitise hands and work behind a table to maximise distancing. So Legion chiefs have launched a host of new and innovative ways to donate safely online through their website rbl. org. uk/poppyappeal. More stars and military top brass backed our call today — after hero fundraiser Captain Tom Moore fired the opening salvo. Good Morning Britain's Susanna Reid said: ""I wear my poppy with pride remembering the contribution of so many during wartime. ""I hope everyone can go online to support the Poppy Appeal which needs our backing more than ever."" THE pandemic may have stopped thousands of sellers from hitting the streets — but it doesn't have to stop you from buying a poppy. MIKE RIDLEY looks at some of the ways you can do your bit for the appeal by going to: …OR POP INTO YOUR LOCAL SAINSBURY'S, TESCO, ASDA, ALDI OR MORRISONS AND BUY A POPPY Strictly Come Dancing head judge Shirley Ballas said: ""I fully support The Sun's campaign, and urge everyone to please do all they can to support the appeal online and donate what they can. ""Now more than ever, we must come together to remember and honour the heroes who sacrificed so much."" Strictly host Claudia Winkleman added: ""It's so important we remember our heroes. ""My family and I wear our poppies every year, and I look forward to ordering ours online."" Now more than ever, we must come together to remember and honour the heroes who sacrificed so much. TV star Judge Robert Rinder said: ""The Royal British Legion represents the very best of who we are and the sacrifice of millions to protect our democracy, our rule of law and rule of life. ""Their work is as vital and important as it ever was and wearing a poppy is our expression of our thanks and gratitude which is needed this year perhaps more than ever before. ""I would encourage everyone to buy one by any means possible, and wear it with pride."" Ex-military chiefs also joined the clarion call. Former head of the Navy Admiral George Zambellas said it was the nation's duty to remember the ""great soldiers, sailors and airmen of the past"". By Mike Ridley EX-SOLDIER Lawrence Philips is quite happy to admit: ""Without the support of the Royal British Legion, I would be dead."" The former Para, 29, served for seven years until he left due to injury. He got a number of jobs but could not settle, suffered mental health problems and admits that he was suicidal. Unable to work during lockdown, he also struggled to pay a £500 loan until the British Legion's financial advisers helped negotiate lower payments. Lawrence, who lives with partner Danielle Forbes in Doncaster, South Yorks, said: ""I never wanted to leave service and found it really tough. ""The British Legion saved my life. They sorted out my mental health and my financial health and I can now look forward to a much better future."" He added: ""They never flinched in the face of danger and we should have the greatest Poppy Appeal we have ever had."" General Richard Barrons, one of the four joint chiefs, said the Poppy Appeal was ""a vital act of remembrance"". He added: ""It is essential and excellent that we have found an alternative way to keep the Poppy Appeal in the public mind, despite the pandemic. Wearing a poppy is our expression of our thanks and gratitude which is needed this year perhaps more than ever before. ""It is the biggest annual occasion when we remember the cost of war and remind ourselves to avoid it at all costs in future."" General Lord Dannatt, a former head of the Army, said: ""This is really a time for people to be generous and support our service charities. ""It's an annual campaign to honour the sacrifice of those who lost their lives in previous wars and also to honour the service of those who are still serving. ""That is as important this year as every other year."" Legion chiefs have appealed to the public to bulk buy poppies through their website and distribute them safely to friends if they do not have access to a traditional seller. People can also make a donation to buy a poppy poster online which can be downloaded, printed and displayed in windows at home. By Mike Ridley SERGEANT Dave Williams has spent the last 30 years collecting for the Poppy Appeal. But this year he won't be able to take his collecting tin on the streets. Both he and wife Hilda tested positive for Covid-19 and are classed as vulnerable due to underlying health problems. So they will have to stay at home and shield in Oldbury, West Mids. Dave, 77, who served 22 years in the Army Catering Corps before joining the Field Hospital Unit as a reservist, says: ""My wife and I both tested positive for Covid but were lucky we only experienced a minor bout of symptoms. ""I am waiting to have an operation in the next month, so I have to isolate in preparation. The Legion has been great in reassuring us that our safety is paramount."" Other ideas include shoppers opting to round up totals to the pound at supermarkets. The Legion community of staff, volunteers, partners and suppliers have been working together to ensure the 2020 Poppy Appeal goes ahead. A spokeswoman said today: ""We're very grateful to The Sun and the incredible support we are receiving. It has given us a real boost."" ""For almost a century, the inspiring sight of veterans of all ages proudly collecting for the Poppy Appeal has been as much a part of autumn as the leaves falling from the trees. This year, of course, will be different. Many of those who face all weathers to rattle tins for our veterans are older citizens – some of them once bravely fought themselves. For as many as 12,000 of them, their vulnerability to an enemy quite unlike any they faced in battle means they will be unable to take up their usual posts in our towns and cities. But while the circumstances in which this year's Poppy Appeal takes place are unlike anything we have seen before, the need for it is greater than ever. So I'm proud to add my name to the list of public figures supporting The Sun's campaign to make this year's appeal a success, regardless of the obstacles thrown in our way by the pandemic. Online, by post or in person, let's all find a way to make our contribution. And, just as those famous flowers burst forth from the mud and devastation of Flanders fields a century ago, so let us ensure that even in this most difficult of autumns our nation is ablaze with red and green as we wear our poppies with pride."""
559,559,The Sun,Matt DathanHarry ColeKate Ferguson,Chancellor Rishi Sunak will extend furlough scheme for workers hit hardest by latest coronavirus restrictions,"RISHI Sunak has shelved his Budget of tax pain and will today announce a part-time furlough scheme. Amid another major spike in daily Covid cases, the Chancellor has delayed paying for the crisis until next year. And with growing Tory fury over the latest clampdown, Mr Sunak has bowed to pressure and will today unveil new measures to subsidise the wages of struggling hospitality staff, including pubs and restaurants, if they can find only part-time work. The latest bailout plan comes as confirmed new coronavirus cases soared above 6,000 — the highest daily number since May 1. And 37 new deaths were confirmed on Wednesday. In a Commons statement on Thursday, the Chancellor is expected to announce a new ""flexible furlough"" scheme targeted at industries that will be hardest hit by the new Covid restrictions. The Sun understands it will allow firms to reduce employees' hours while keeping them in a job, with the Government paying part of the lost wages. For example, a worker who usually works 37 hours a week would be able to do just 17 hours but still receive their full wage. The company would be able to charge the remaining 20 hours of wage costs to the Government. The Chancellor will put a cap on the subsidy going to each worker — expected to be similar to the £30,000 salary ceiling of the current furlough scheme. The new scheme is aimed at avoiding major job losses in the hospitality sector. It will follow dire warnings that a quarter of all businesses in the sector fear they will go bust by the end of the year without further support. But the plans faced major internal opposition from tax bosses who warned of the risk of fraud. A source said: ""HMRC are really nervous about this scheme and that's why there's been a delay. People would very quickly cotton on and commit widespread furlough fraud."" Mr Sunak has been hugely reluctant to consider any form of extension of the furlough scheme. But a source said the ""Red Wall"" group of Tory MPs — whose seats are most at risk of mass job losses — forced him to change his mind. Transport Minister Robert Courts has privately told MPs that new flexible furlough will also be available to the aviation industry. More than 33,000 people are believed to have lost their jobs in that sector already. The Chancellor will also announce a new government jobs scheme aimed at retraining hundreds of thousands of people out of work due to the Covid crisis. A Treasury source said: ""Giving people reassurance and businesses the help they need to get through this is uppermost in his mind."" On Wednesday night the Treasury confirmed the Budget, planned for November, had been cancelled and will be replaced with a ""Winter Economy Plan"". Explaining the decision, a spokesman said it was too early to outline a long-term recovery strategy and the Government needed maximum flexibility to respond to the pandemic. Mr Sunak's furlough extension comes amid claims of a major rift between Boris Johnson and chief medical officer Chris Whitty. And Tory MPs broke cover to demand that the pessimistic doctor should be sidelined. They questioned data he used in Monday's doom-laden presentation on Covid cases that forced Mr Johnson's mini lockdown. Party grandee Sir Desmond Swayne told The Sun: ""After his performance at Monday's press conference, he should consider his position or the Prime Minister might like to consider it. ""I thought it was very poor — he was terrifying the public by producing this graph and saying, 'It's not a prediction'. Well, what was the purpose of it then?"" But Downing Street hit back to say they had their full confidence in Professor Whitty and the advice he was giving the Prime Minister. Denying any rift, a No10 source said: ""There's nothing but love from Boris for the boffins."" WE argued that Rishi Sunak should not extend the furlough, as the Left demanded. That way, we said, lay fiscal madness. But six months ago we could not envisage a Tory Government hammering the hospitality sector a second time and driving one in four firms to possible bankruptcy before the year ends. And fiscal sanity is now long gone. So the Chancellor may be right to target yet more funds at those staff. None of this is their fault, nor their firms'. But we will add this. The evidence that closing pubs and restaurants at 10pm will make a jot of difference to our rocketing infections looks dodgy at best. Boris and his erratic boffins had better be sure of their ground. The cost looks utterly ruinous. Meanwhile, the PM faces a major rebellion in a vote next week on extending the Government's emergency coronavirus powers. Dozens of Tories are threatening to vote for an amendment that would give MPs a veto over all future measures. One, Richard Drax, said: ""We are causing undue harm to our economy and to people's health and livelihoods."""
560,560,The Sun,Natasha ClarkHarry ColeMatt Dathan,Boris Johnson urges Brits to pull together to avoid 2nd lockdown as he warns ‘your cough could be someone’s death knell’,"BORIS Johnson tonight warned the nation ""your cough could be someone else's death knell"" as he begged the country to pull together to defeat the virus. The PM urged Brits to show ""discipline, resolve, and the spirit of togetherness"" to get Britain through the ""difficult"" winter months to come - or face a new national lockdown. In a live TV address - only the third time he has spoken to the nation in a recorded broadcast during the pandemic - he reassured the public that there ""are great days ahead"" once the fight against covid is over. And it was only by working together collectively would the current soaring rate of infections start to come down. In a message of hope he said: ""I am more certain than ever that this is a struggle that humanity will win, and we in this country will win."" However, for the first time he entertained the possibility of a ""tougher"" new national lockdown and what it would mean for the country, just weeks after he lifted restrictions. Mr Johnson warned the nation that he would have no choice but to impose ""significantly greater restrictions"" later this year if the new measures fail to bring the 'R' value of the virus below 1. The fight against covid is by no means over, he said. He warned it would threaten the shutting down of schools once again - something he has said he never wants to do. And it would see millions of older and vulnerable people face crippling loneliness once again. The PM told the nation: ""If we were forced into a new national lockdown, that would threaten not just jobs and livelihoods but the loving human contact on which we all depend. ""We must do all we can to avoid going down that road again. ""But if people don't follow the rules we have set out, then we must reserve the right to go further."" Never before has the destiny of the nation relied so ""completely on our individual behaviour"", he said. We risk ""many more deaths"" if we don't act now, he stressed. But ""if we follow these simple rules together, we will get through this winter together"", he said. He announced this afternoon new rules for England - but Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will take similar steps. The plans include: The nation is now ""better prepared"" with PPE, extra beds, the Nightingale hospitals and new medicines, all of which will help save lives, Boris stressed tonight. But he added: ""There are unquestionably difficult months to come."" By next year he hoped the ""dream"" of a vaccine and mass testing could mean a return to a more ordinary life. Boris said: ""That's the hope; that's the dream. It's hard, but it's attainable, and we are working as hard as we can to get there."" The PM also slapped down critics who want him to let the virus ""rip"" through society or to ""lock up"" the vulnerable saying it would eventually ""find its way through to the elderly as well"" and kill people nevertheless. Nicola Sturgeon, Arlene Foster and Mark Drakeford gave national addresses to Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales too. His TV message to the people comes after an address in the House of Commons earlier today, where he told MPs that hospital admissions have more than doubled in the last fortnight - and Britain has reached a ""perilous turning point"" like in France and Spain that forced him to act. And the PM gave warnings that ""significantly greater restrictions"" could be slapped on the country ""if all our actions fail to bring the R below 1"" in the coming weeks. He stopped short of announcing a two-week circuit break of shutdowns to put a brake on the spread - but said the army could be brought in to help police. The PM told the nation: ""I am sorry this will affect businesses who have just got back up on their feet. ""But we must act to stop the virus being transmitted in restaurants and bars."" The Prime Minister said: ""We should assume that the restrictions I have announced will remain in place for perhaps six months. ""For the time being, this virus is a fact of our lives and I must tell the House and the country that our fight against it will continue."" Despite just last week declaring his aim to save the family Christmas, the PM warned the clampdown will last at least six months It came just hours before Scots leader Nicola Sturgeon announced a complete ban on household mixing north of the border - saying Boris' rules didn't go far enough. The First Minister said this afternoon the new restrictions on indoor gatherings comes alongside 10pm curfews for pubs - but people can continue to meet each other in outdoor settings. The PM announced no new restrictions on households meeting up today - but ministers are holding the move in reserve in case the spike in infections continues. The number of new cases is growing fastest for people in their 20s, he said today, but it's now spreading to other age groups, Boris said. And it's likely to get even worse as Britain goes into winter, he said. Boris said: ""This is by no means a return to a full lockdown as in March. ""We are not issuing a general instruction to stay at home. We will ensure that schools and universities stay open. ""But we must take action to suppress the disease."" Ministers want to avoid shutting down shops and offices once again if they can help it. And schools will be the absolute last thing to close too to try and keep kids' education on track. Mr Johnson added: ""We have to acknowledge this is a great and freedom-loving country. ""And while the vast majority have complied with the rules there have been too many breaches — too many opportunities for our invisible enemy to slip through undetected. ""The virus has started to spread again in an exponential way. Infections are up, hospital admissions are climbing."" The PM faced a wave of fury from Tory MPs who warned the new measures went too far and threatened both individual freedoms and even deeper economic damage. And Mr Johnson now faces a major Tory rebellion in a crunch Commons vote next week over the new measures. Tory Sir Desmond Swayne said he was ""dismayed"" and blasted today's announcements as ""the wrong strategy"". Fellow Tory MP Richard Drax told The Sun: ""I disagree with this very strongly and fundamentally. It's going to cause a lot of harm to an awful lot of people."" Former Cabinet minister David Davis said it had convinced him to back a move by Tory grandee Sir Graham Brady to give MPs a veto over future measures. Tory MPs dubbed the home-working changes the 13th Covid U-turn from the PM — who recently led calls for staff to return to workplaces. And one MP blasted: ""I'm depressed, it's not good. ""Opening pubs before gyms now looks really stupid. Telling people to 'get back to work and get down the boozer' now looks really dumb."" Tonight, a snap YouGov poll found the overwhelming majority of the public backed the new restrictions — and half said the PM should go even further. Good evening, the struggle against covid is the single biggest crisis the world has faced in my lifetime. In less than a year this disease has killed almost a million people, and caused havoc to economies everywhere. Here in the UK we mourn every person we have lost, and we grieve with their families. And yet I am more certain than ever that this is a struggle that humanity will win, and we in this country will win – and to achieve what we must I want to talk to you directly tonight about the choices that we face – none of them easy – and why we must take action now. I know that we can succeed because we have succeeded before. When the sickness took hold in this country in March, we pulled together in a spirit of national sacrifice and community. We followed the guidance to the letter. We stayed at home, protected the NHS, and saved thousands of lives. And for months with those disciplines of social distancing we have kept that virus at bay. But we have to acknowledge this this is a great and freedom-loving country; and while the vast majority have complied with the rules there have been too many breaches – too many opportunities for our invisible enemy to slip through undetected. The virus has started to spread again in an exponential way. Infections are up, hospital admissions are climbing. We can see what is happening in France and Spain, and we know, alas, that this virus is no less fatal than it was in the spring, and that the vast majority of our people are no less susceptible, and the iron laws of geometrical progression are shouting at us from the graphs that we risk many more deaths, many more families losing loved ones before their time; and I know that faced with that risk the British people will want their government to continue to fight to protect them, you, and that is what we are doing, night and day. And yet the single greatest weapon we bring to this fight is the common sense of the people themselves – the joint resolve of this country to work together to suppress covid now. So today I set out a package of tougher measures in England – early closing for pubs, bars; table service only; closing businesses that are not covid secure; expanding the use of face coverings, and new fines for those that fail to comply; and once again asking office workers to work from home if they can while enforcing the rule of six indoors and outdoors – a tougher package of national measures combined with the potential for tougher local restrictions for areas already in lockdown. I know that this approach – robust but proportionate – already carries the support of all the main parties in parliament. After discussion with colleagues in the Devolved Administrations, I believe this broad approach is shared across the whole UK. And to those who say we don't need this stuff, and we should leave people to take their own risks, I say these risks are not our own. The tragic reality of having covid is that your mild cough can be someone else's death knell. And as for the suggestion that we should simply lock up the elderly and the vulnerable – with all the suffering that would entail – I must tell you that this is just not realistic, because if you let the virus rip through the rest of the population it would inevitably find its way through to the elderly as well, and in much greater numbers. That's why we need to suppress the virus now, and as for that minority who may continue to flout the rules, we will enforce those rules with tougher penalties and fines of up to £10,000. We will put more police out on the streets and use the army to backfill if necessary. And of course I am deeply, spiritually reluctant to make any of these impositions, or infringe anyone's freedom, but unless we take action the risk is that we will have to go for tougher measures later, when the deaths have already mounted and we have a huge caseload of infection such as we had in the spring. If we let this virus get out of control now, it would mean that our NHS had no space – once again – to deal with cancer patients and millions of other non-covid medical needs. And if we were forced into a new national lockdown, that would threaten not just jobs and livelihoods but the loving human contact on which we all depend. It would mean renewed loneliness and confinement for the elderly and vulnerable, and ultimately it would threaten once again the education of our children. We must do all we can to avoid going down that road again. But if people don't follow the rules we have set out, then we must reserve the right to go further. We must take action now because a stitch in time saves nine; and this way we can keep people in work, we can keep our shops and our schools open, and we can keep our country moving forward while we work together to suppress the virus. That is our strategy, and if we can follow this package together, then I know we can succeed because in so many ways we are better prepared than before. We have the PPE, we have the beds, we have the Nightingales, we have new medicines – pioneered in this country – that can help save lives. And though our doctors and our medical advisers are rightly worried about the data now, and the risks over winter, they are unanimous that things will be far better by the spring, when we have not only the hope of a vaccine, but one day soon – and I must stress that we are not there yet - of mass testing so efficient that people will be able to be tested in minutes so they can do more of the things they love. That's the hope; that's the dream. It's hard, but it's attainable, and we are working as hard as we can to get there. But until we do, we must rely on our willingness to look out for each other, to protect each other. Never in our history has our collective destiny and our collective health depended so completely on our individual behaviour. If we follow these simple rules together, we will get through this winter together. There are unquestionably difficult months to come. And the fight against covid is by no means over. I have no doubt, however, that there are great days ahead. But now is the time for us all to summon the discipline, and the resolve, and the spirit of togetherness that will carry us through. PUBS, bars and restaurants will have to shut up shop at 10pm sharp or risk heavy fines for breaching Covid rules. It means last orders will now take place just after 9.30pm. Staff must also wear masks at all times, and punters are barred from going to the bar to order. Boozers must offer table service and risk being shut down if they allow people to gather in groups larger than six. Takeaways must also shut at 10pm but deliveries can carry on later. ENGLAND is sticking to the rule of six, breaking with the rest of the UK. But indoor team sports will come under the rule for the first time, meaning five-a-side indoor footie is off the cards. ""Care bubbles"" are allowed in areas with a ban on two households mixing so grandparents can help with childcare. Scotland and Northern Ireland have both banned households mixing indoors. Outside, two households can meet in groups of up to six. Under-12s are exempt. THE Government is again encouraging people to work from home — but it does not apply to those who cannot easily do so such as those in construction, manufacturing, hospitality, retail and education. Public sector employees processing essential services including passports, driving licences and probate should continue going into the office. The move is designed to reduce chains of transmission but ensure as ""little disruption as possible"". WORKERS in shops, pubs, restaurants, bars and hotels must wear face coverings. Punters must also wear one in pubs until they are seated at a table. All taxi passengers must also wear coverings. Fines for failing to wear a mask and breaking the rule of six have doubled to £200. Penalties were increased after too many people failed to comply, with fines doubling on every new breach. Businesses that break Covid rules could be fined up to £10,000 and shut down altogether. TROOPS from three battalions will step in if police are over-stretched. They may be drafted in to guard key sites such as Parliament, Downing Street and nuclear power stations. About 500 troops will form the first wave of reinforcements with 12 hours' notice, according to defence sources. No10 said: ""This would involve the military filling duties such as office roles and guarding protected sites so police officers can enforce the virus response."" FROM Monday, wedding ceremonies and receptions in England have to be capped at 15 people but funeral services can still have 30 attendees. Celebrations held this weekend narrowly avoid the new rules. Thirty guests are allowed in Wales while in Scotland ceremonies and receptions can admit 20. Numbers permitted in Northern Ireland depend on the venue. One bride, due to get married on December 12 after being engaged for five years, said she was ""gutted"". MINISTERS have scuppered plans to get Premier League fans back into stadiums next month, with spectators unlikely to be allowed in to see games until next year. Plans to allow up to 1,000 fans into lower league games have also been axed. But fans will still be able to attend ""non-elite"" games under the sixth tier of English football, providing vital revenue to community clubs. But indoor sports, like five-a-side footie, are banned after their exemption to the rule of six was removed."
561,561,The Sun,Ellie CambridgeStephen MoyesHarry ColeJerome Starkey,"Army could be used to help police enforce coronavirus laws, warns Boris Johnson","THE Army could be used to help police enforce coronavirus laws, Boris Johnson warned today. Five hundred soldiers, currently on standby, would guard sites such as Downing Street, parliament and nuclear power plants - to free up cops responding to coronavirus calls. Troops from three battalions will step-in if armed police are overstretched. Plans seen by The Sun show infantry soldiers, armed with SA80 assault rifles, are ready to be drafted in. Around 500 troops will form the first wave of reinforcements with 12 hours notice to move, defence sources said. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""To further free up the police to have a greater presence on our streets they will have the option to draw on military support, where required, using tried and tested mechanisms. ""This would involve the military backfilling certain duties, such as office roles and guarding protected sites, so police officers can be out enforcing the virus response. Today's fresh plan includes: ""This is not about providing any additional powers to the military, or them replacing the police in enforcement roles, and they will not be handing out fines. It is about freeing up more police officers."" The Prime Minister told MPs: ""We will provide the police and local authorities with the extra funding they need, a greater police presence on our streets, and the option to draw on military support where required to free up the police."" Police chiefs would decide where to deploy the military and soldiers would not take over, and currently the National Police Chiefs Council believes: ""At the moment, no military involvement is necessary, nor do we anticipate this will be needed."" But troops may be covertly moved around the country according to the secret doc. 'Operation Temperer' was launched for the first time in 2017 after the bombing of an Ariana Grande concert at the Manchester Arena which killed 23 people and wounded 139 fans. The PM said he did not want to have to restrict freedoms further but warned the nation he would do so if people don't stick to the rules. He said Britain has reached a ""perilous turning point"", adding: ""In the last fortnight daily hospital admissions in England have more than doubled. ""Tens of thousands of daily infections in October would, as night follows day, lead to hundreds of daily deaths in November and those numbers would continue to grow unless we act."" He revealed the restrictions, which include pubs and restaurants closing at 10pm and meeting in groups of no more than six people, could be in place for six months. He told the Commons: ""I fervently want to avoid taking this step, as do the devolved administrations but we will only be able to avoid it if our new measures work and our behaviour changes. ""For the time being, this virus is a fact of our lives and I must tell the House and the country that our fight against it will continue."" He warned the virus is getting worse across the country, and extra measures need to be put in place now to avoid another national lockdown. The PM said: ""A stitch in time saves nine. But this is by no means a return to a full lockdown as in March Mr Johnson said the hospitality sector will be restricted to table service only, and emphasised the need for people to follow social-distancing guidance, wear face coverings and wash their hands regularly. We will provide the police and local authorities with the extra funding they need, a greater police presence on our streets, and the option to draw on military support where required to free up the police. Brits were earlier told to work from home if they can in a huge shift away from the 'back to work' message. After weeks of telling people to go back into their offices, today Michael Gove confirmed there had been a change of tack to stop the spread of the bug. The nation has been told they should limit the number of households that people are coming into contact with to minimise the risk of infection. People in the North and Midlands are already banned from visiting others in their homes or gardens, or hanging out with people they do not live with in pubs. The Covid threat level was raised from three to four yesterday, meaning the virus is running amok across the country — signalling six months of further misery. Chief medical adviser Chris Whitty warned everyone has a part to play in stopping the disease, insisting: ""This is not someone else's problem, this is all of our problems."" A senior Whitehall source said: ""Every option comes with a very big stick."" The PM will chair an emergency meeting of Cobra this morning — the first in months — and summon his Cabinet to sign off his new clampdown."
562,562,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Boris Johnson orders ‘enforcement blitzkrieg’ on pubs that flout the ‘rule of six’,"BORIS Johnson is plotting a Covid rules ""enforcement blitzkrieg"" tomorrow after Britain's top scientists warned Britain could see 200 deaths a day again by November. The clampdown will see pubs and restaurants shut down by patrols if they allow punters to flout the ""rule of six"" - and groups could be broken up and fined. After shocking warnings from chief medic Chris Whitty that the UK death total could yet soar by thousands, Mr Johnson is preparing  to unveil a package of tough new measures. Ahead of a COBRA meeting of ministers and law enforcement tomorrow morning, a senior Whitehall source told The Sun: ""Every option comes with a very big stick."" In a Cabinet conference call on Saturday, ministers were warned that the death toll in the UK could yet soar by thousands if action is not taken now. But Mr Johnson is under massive pressure from his top team not to plunge Britain into a further economic crisis with more stringent lockdown measures like completely closing the hospitality sector. A government source said: ""Police and councils will be told to act immediately when they see the rules being broken. ""Lots of pubs and restaurants are following the law, but others are not. ""Those that flout it will be shut down."" Police are currently using a ""4 Es"" strategy - ""Engage, Explain, Encourage, Enforce"" - to implement the virus rules. But some Ministers want the Enforcement option to be increased before further lockdown measures are imposed. Police guidance states ""officers may remove a person to the place where they live, using reasonable force only if it is a necessary and proportionate means of ensuring compliance"" during the Enforcement phase. The Sun understands a range of new enforcement measures will be pushed by the Prime Minister in an address to the nation pencilled in for tomorrow evening after updating MPs on Tuesday morning. It will sit alongside the measures to limit ""unnecessary social contact"" hinted at by Mr Whitty on Monday. In a bleak press conference, Mr Whitty and Chief Scientist Sir Patrick Vallance warned the daily death rate would return to hundreds per day by November if the virus cases are allowed to continue doubling every seven days. Britain could face 50,000 new coronavirus cases a day in just three weeks and deaths could soar if the bug continues to spread at its current rate. Sir Patrick warned: ""In every age group we have seen an increase… It is now estimated that roughly 70,000 people in the UK have Covid infection and that about 6,000 people per day are getting the infection. ""If that continues unabated and this grows doubling every seven days then what you see… is by mid October we would end up with something like 50,000 cases per day."" Professor Whitty added that everyone has a part to play in stopping the disease, saying: ""This is not someone else's problem, this is all of our problems. ""We must see this as a six month problem – we have to take this collectively very seriously."" Earlier this morning Matt Hancock hinted that pubs may face extra curbs from this weekend. Mr Hancock said ""no final decisions"" have been made but warned Brits they could face even tighter restrictions as the UK tries desperately to get a second wave of the virus under control."
563,563,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha ClarkKate FergusonSascha O'Sullivan,UK lockdown: Pubs to close at 10pm across England as covid alert level RISES to 4,"BORIS Johnson is to announce a 10pm closing time for pubs tomorrow, The Sun can reveal, as scientists increased the nation's alert level to FOUR. As part of a package of measures to be unveiled to tackle soaring Covid cases, the Prime Minister will slap a curfew on the hospitality industry and enforce patrols to make sure venues are obeying the ""rule of six"". And pubs, bars and restaurants could be shut completely in virus hotspots. The measures, which were outlined to devolved leaders today, will be kept under review. The curfew is different to the one currently in place in Wales - where they face an 11pm shutdown - but is significantly less severe than a possible two week complete shut-down which was mooted by SAGE scientists just last week. It's not yet clear when the new rules will come in, or how long they will last for. But Dr Bharat Pankhania, an epidemiologist from the University of Exeter, slammed the 10pm curfew as ineffective. Asked if he believed the move would help reduce transmission, he told the BBC last night: ""No, not at all. Come on, the virus doesn't understand the clock so if you're going to close at 10pm, what about at 9pm, what about 8pm? ""We know human behaviours, we know our country's pub behaviour. At 8.30, 9pm people will be buying extra drinks and alcohol, unfortunately allows you to drop your guard."" And Wetherspoons boss Tim Martin slammed them too - telling TalkRadio's Dan Wootton: "" ""We've only just finished Eat Out To Help Out... the public has become confused... ""I really think this deserves a proper debate in parliament"". It came as the nation's four chief scientists lifted the UK's covid threat level up from three to four. It means transmission of the virus is high, or rising ""exponentially"", and more social distancing measures are likely to come in. A statement from the top boffins said today: ""After a period of lower COVID cases and deaths, the number of cases are now rising rapidly and probably exponentially in significant parts of all four nations. ""If we are to avoid significant excess deaths and exceptional pressure in the NHS and other health services over the autumn and winter everyone has to follow the social distancing guidance, wear face coverings correctly and wash their hands regularly."" Health Sec Matt Hancock said of the latest news: ""The raising of the alert level announced by the UK CMOs reflects the significant shift in the current threat posed by coronavirus. ""This country now faces a tipping point in its response and it is vital everybody plays their part now to stop the spread of the virus and protect lives."" The alert level has been at level three since it was moved down on June 19 - paving the way for relaxing of restrictions. And this evening Northern Ireland's first minister Arlene Foster said that people would be BANNED from mixing with other households inside. She told the nation this evening: ""The mixing of households indoors is one of the best opportunities for the spread of the virus."" The measures come amid a dire warnings on Monday from the Government's chief medical officers that Covid-19 is resurgent. Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance said the nation could face 50,000 new coronavirus cases a day in just three weeks and deaths could soar if the bug continues to spread at its current rate, the nation's top medics warned this morning. The PM will chair an emergency meeting of COBRA - the first in months - and spoke to his counterparts in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland today to discuss new measures. A No10 spokesperson said this evening: ""During these calls, the Prime Minister made clear that the rising infection rates are a cause for great concern, which he is taking very seriously."" The Sun revealed this morning how the PM is planning a fresh attack on pubs that let their residents flout the 'rule of six'. The clampdown will see pubs and restaurants shut down by patrols - and groups could be broken up and fined. A senior Whitehall source told The Sun: ""Every option comes with a very big stick."" A government source said: ""Police and councils will be told to act immediately when they see the rules being broken. ""Lots of pubs and restaurants are following the law, but others are not. ""Those that flout it will be shut down."" It came as cases of the virus rise in the UK and across Europe, Professor Whitty and Sir Patrick explained today. They told the nation how the bug is spreading as the nation moves towards a challenging winter. Using charts and graphs to set out the latest figures, they showed how the virus isn't just spreading among younger people, but now older generations too - and more people are in hospital as a result. Sir Patrick warned: ""In every age group we have seen an increase… It is now estimated that roughly 70,000 people in the UK have Covid infection and that about 6,000 people per day are getting the infection. ""If that continues unabated and this grows doubling every seven days then what you see… is by mid October we would end up with something like 50,000 cases per day."" Two hundred people a day could be dying by the middle of November if the trend continues, he said. Professor Whitty added that everyone has a part to play in stopping the disease, saying: ""This is not someone else's problem, this is all of our problems. ""We must see this as a six month problem – we have to take this collectively very seriously."" And he said there was no evidence the virus is any milder than it was before. The top doc added: ""A lot of people have said maybe this is a milder virus than it was in April, I'm afraid although it would be great if that were true, this is not the case."" Only around eight per cent of the population have been infected so far with the bug. The nation's top scientists revealed there could be huge ramifications if they didn't curb the virus, including: The PM is expected to make an announcement to the nation in the coming days on what new measures will be put in place. The Cabinet are due to discuss the changes with him today. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ""The PM has been engaged with the Cabinet throughout this process. The Cabinet received a detailed briefing from the Government's chief medical, scientific and economic advisers over the course of the weekend. ""The PM will work with his colleagues to ensure that we respond in the most effective way to try to control the spread of the virus and to save lives."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said this lunchtime that ""a package of additional measures"" is on the cards. But he faces a backlash as ministers fear a second lockdown will kill the economy. But senior Tory MPs urged Boris Johnson to hold firm and not risk ""economic disaster"" by ordering another national lockdown. It seems likely after the dire warning people will be ordered to stay away from their family and friends - rules which are already in place in some parts of the country. Patrick Vallance said today: ""The way that we reduce the spread is by limiting our number of contacts, by reducing contact in environments where spread is more likely - those are crowded environments, indoor environments, poor ventilation - and making sure that we reduce the probability of coming into contact with anyone who is infectious."" Mr Shapps said today ahead of the speech: ""We need to push down on the R-rate by restricting social contact."" The nation has been told they should limit the number of households that people are coming into contact with to minimise the risk of infection. People in the North and Midlands are already banned from visiting others in their homes or gardens, or hanging out with people they don't live with in pubs and restaurants. This also means people who don't live together can't meet their lovers either. Mr Hancock said ""no final decisions"" have been made but warned Brits they could face even tighter restrictions as the UK tries desperately to get a second wave of the virus under control. When asked if pubs could be closed this weekend, Mr Hancock told ITV's This Morning: ""We will be absolutely clear about the changes we need to make in the very, very near future."" He said the answer to pubs closing is ""not a not, and it's not a yes"". He added: ""We have been working on this all weekend, we haven't taken the final decisions about what we need to do in response to the surge that we have seen in the last few weeks."" Wales also revealed today four new areas will face local lockdowns from tomorrow night, it was confirmed today. Blaenau Gwent, Bridgend, Merthyr Tydfil and Newport will have extra rules from 6pm tomorrow night. People can't leave the area without a good reason - such as school or work. They can't meet people they don't live with indoors, but they can meet outside. Extended households or support bubbles are off, too. All pubs and other licensed premises will have to shut by 11pm. Restrictions in the North West will also come in tomorrow too - covering Lancashire, Northumberland, County Dunham and Tyne and Wear. Pubs, cafes and restaurants will have to offer table service only, and they will have to shut by 10pm and can't open again until 5pm. And people will not be allowed to socialise with ANY friends and family outside of their own households either - inside or outside. That includes public places like pubs and parks, but also inside private homes and gardens too. People must not use public transport except for essential purposes - like travelling to school or work. The public will still be allowed to take holidays - but it cannot be with anyone they don't live with (or have a support bubble with), putting an end to stag and hen parties. People living in the new lockdown areas must not go to watch any sport games either. TWO WEEK LOCKDOWN: The nation could face extra rules for two weeks as part of a temporary move to curb the virus. PUB CURFEW: Already in the North East and West of England pubs are shutting at 10pm to stop the spread. PUBS SHUT: In some areas that are really badly hit, pubs have been ordered to shut except for takeaway food. BAN ON SEEING FRIENDS: Many people are currently not allowed to see people from outside their household. Those measures could be seen across the nation."
564,564,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson hits back at US presidential hopeful Joe Biden for weighing in over Brexit row,"BORIS Johnson tonight hit back at Joe Biden for weighing in over Brexit. The PM was upset by the Democratic Presidential hopeful's jibe at his plan to tweak last year's EU divorce deal. Mr Biden tweeted: ""We can't allow the Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland to become a casualty of Brexit."" But Mr Johnson's spokesman suggested Mr Biden did not understand the issues. It echoes Donald Trump, who has repeatedly attacked Mr Biden as ""Sleepy Joe"", saying he gets confused and is prone to gaffes. Downing Street said: ""We continue to remain absolutely committed to no hard border and no border infrastructure between the Republic and Northern Ireland"" Asked if Mr Biden was wrong, the spokesman replied: ""We will continue to work with our US partners to ensure our position is understood but the whole point of this — as the Prime Minister has set out — is to make sure the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement is upheld."" WHAT does Joe Biden hope to achieve, cluelessly blundering into the row over the Brexit deal . . . and threatening Britain? You don't need to be fans of Donald Trump to think the doddery Democrat should try to grasp our case as well as the EU's (or, more specifically, Ireland's). The reality is that a Biden-run America would be even less keen on the UK than it was under his old boss Barack Obama. But if that happens, so be it. While a historic trade deal would be great for Brits and Americans, standing up for our rights as a newly independent nation must come first. And that, for all the furore over his tactics, is what Boris Johnson is doing. Mr Biden's comments came just hours after the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he trusted the Brits to get it right. And former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith told Mr Biden to worry more about ""killing and rioting"" in the US. He blasted: ""We don't need lectures on the Northern Ireland peace deal from Mr Biden."""
565,565,The Sun,Natasha ClarkHarry Cole,Boris Johnson admits he might have to shut the pubs early – but he doesn’t want to close them entirely,"BORIS Johnson may have to shut the nation's pubs early but he doesn't want to have to close them, he admitted last night. The PM told The Sun in an exclusive interview he could have to slap on extra curfew measures to Brits if they didn't obey the rule of six and get case numbers down. Back in March, Mr Johnson compared the Covid cases graph to a sombrero hat — urging Britain to ""squash it"" by lockdown. Now he warns that the graph is starting to look like a camel's back, so it's time to act again. One of the measures under consideration is a pubs curfew to stop the spread, but the Government want to keep them open to keep the economy afloat. Asked directly about a curfew on pubs and restaurants to tackle the spread, Mr Johnson insisted: ""I don't think we are yet in that position but look around the world at what other countries are doing. ""What I don't want to be doing is locking down sections of the economy."" But he warned: ""I remember when the pubs used to close at 11 anyway in the old days. ""That sort of thing, we will be looking at it."" His plea came as: A No10 spokesperson said today: ""I believe the PM said that we will look at restrict opening hours at a local level… but we will keep restrictions under review. ""We don't want to bring in these types of measures and that's why we brought in the rule of six and are asking people to abide by it. "" Defending the restriction that means only six people can meet up socially, he said: ""I know that a lot of people feel that it's excessive and heavy-handed... but unfortunately the disease has not gone away. ""There are places in Europe which I will not name, such is my reputation for diplomacy, where we've come down one hump of the camel and we are approaching the next."" And he warned that a recent surge in cases to more than 3,000 a day will lead to a rise in the death rate. He said: ""I'm afraid infections do feed through to mortality and that is a fact we have to deal with."" He urged Brits to do their part to help avoid that fate, saying: ""We don't want to go there. We want this package to work. ""We are urging people to be cautious. We want people to be disciplined to get the R down."" Yesterday Kevin Fenton, the London director of Public Health England, suggested that curfews for pubs could come into play for the capital. He told the Evening Standard:  ""In some areas which have seen resurgence there have been limits placed on the amount of time you can spend socialising. ""In some it might be local curfews so you're not out drinking until the wee hours of the morning. ""By limiting that you also limit the amount of time people are spending in close contact with others."" Linda Bold, public health professor at Edinburgh University, told Times Radio that curfews were on the cards because the longer people were out drinking the more likely they were to ""let their guard down"" and forget about social distancing. Mr Argar played down reports that the government was considering a new, time-limited national lockdown as coronavirus cases continue to rise. ""It is not something I have seen within the department,"" he told Sky News this morning. Pubs in Bolton have already been ordered to shut except for takeaways - and they have to be closed by 10pm at night. It's expected that local lockdown announcements coming later today will have some form of curbs on pubs involved too. Rhondda Cynon Taf will force its pubs to close at 11pm tonight as the second county in South Wales to have its own local rules."
566,566,The Sun,Harry Cole,"After Charlie Elphicke’s sex assault conviction, his wife explains highly controversial decision to back ‘Naughty Tory","THE MP wife of ""Naughty Tory"" Charlie Elphicke stunned Westminster when she revealed she was backing his appeal – just weeks after dumping him after he was convicted of sexual assault. Former MP Elphicke, 49, was jailed for two years on Tuesday for groping two women in attacks nine years apart. The court heard how he had used his position and influence to exert power over both victims. Mum-of-two Natalie, 49, stood by her husband throughout his trial as she found out for the first time about his cheating. After his conviction she announced she was divorcing him due to his betrayal. But now Natalie, who took over as Dover's Conservative MP from her husband last December, is now backing his appeal, saying he has had an unfair trial. Here she tells The Sun's HARRY COLE why she has made the extraordinary decision to stand by her husband, once described in court as a ""sexual predator"". And she reveals details of the extraordinary night he turned up on her doorstep begging for help. ""MEN sometimes stray, wives always wish they wouldn't. During the past three years I learned a lot about Charlie mucking around with other women, which I would rather not have known. During the trial the court was told about an affair he had — not with either of the women who were his accusers in court. Naturally, I was furious about it, as I knew the woman involved. It was obvious to me from reading the evidence during lockdown that the criminal allegations against him were complete nonsense, and I still believe they are. Indeed, Charlie told me he ended the affair because he was concerned that I might get suspicious. As well as his disloyalty, I couldn't believe his stupidity. She was so embarrassingly and gushingly obsessed with him that at one point I banned him from driving her home, lest he be tempted. And of course, it turned out to be so. But a consensual affair, however wrongful in his marriage to me, is a very different thing from being accused of sex crimes. Charlie is charming, wealthy, charismatic and successful — attractive, and attracted to, women. All things that in today's climate made him an easy target for dirty politics and false allegations. So I resolved to stand by him while he fought off these allegations in court and decided that I would leave him after that. It didn't quite work out that way. Following an unfair trial during the Covid-19 pandemic, I believe that Charlie was convicted in a terrible miscarriage of justice. It was obvious to me from reading the evidence during lockdown that the criminal allegations against him were complete nonsense, and I still believe they are. If you're a survivor of sexual assault, help is available at The Survivors Trust. Go to: thesurvivorstrust. org or call 08088 010818 He is appealing his sentence and the verdict. I fully support him in that. Following the trial I was so angry that I marched off, publicly called an end to our marriage and filed for divorce, as I had intended. I told The Sun of the hurt that had been inflicted on our entire family and how Charlie could get his things and go. It didn't quite work out like that either. Because Charlie turned up on the doorstep begging to be let in. It turned out the judge had ordered that he live at our home. And then she immediately went on holiday. So I had little option but to exile him to the spare room downstairs while I began mentally and physically deleting memories of 25 years of marriage. Charlie, meanwhile, began preparing for the nightmare of being sentenced. Then calls, letters and cards started rolling in to each of us. He had so many messages of support after the verdict. Person after person messaged about the difference Charlie had made for our community over years of public service. People wrote of his individual kindnesses and the help he had given to them. Help that had made a real difference in so many cases. But a consensual affair, however wrongful in his marriage to me, is a very different thing from being accused of sex crimes. We discussed his sentence. I looked at the guidelines. It seemed clear to me that community service should be ordered. A senior probation officer filed a report agreeing a community sentence was appropriate. But always the concern had to be that the court could be on a mission in sentencing, as I believed they had been during the trial. So he might get sent to jail. And so it has turned out to be. Yet another injustice heaped on so very many that started all the way back when he was denounced publicly in November 2017. Back then he was not even told by the Chief Whip, who very publicly suspended him, who had made accusations or what they were. Since then, it has been a shocking and appalling cascade of calamity. The more I saw of the messages of support and the more I saw of Charlie looking after our son, the more I was reminded of the Charlie I met all those years ago. A great carer and a true giver. A chastened Charlie who asked me to forgive him for the mess he had made of things and his appalling behaviour. At the same time, I was inundated with people asking me to forgive Charlie and take him back. As things stand, I have not decided on our future together. I wanted him to continue to co-parent our teenage son while he is growing up. But I can't consider our future together, and he can't co-parent our son, because not only was he wrongly convicted — he is now wrongly in jail. That is one of the reasons I will be supporting his appeal against this wrongful conviction and serious miscarriage of justice."""

The Home Secretary and junior ministers sparked a major backlash on Monday by demanding people grass their friends and neighbours for breaking the Rule of Six. But the Prime Minister says we should step in first and talk to rulebreakers before reporting them to the authorities. He told The Sun: ""I have never much been in favour of sneak culture, myself. ""What people should do in the first instance is obviously if they are concerned is raise it with their friends and neighbours. ""But I think what is reasonable for anyone to do is if they think there is a serious threat to public health as a result of their neighbour's activities - if there is some huge kind of Animal House party taking place, as I am sure, hot tubs and so forth, and there is a serious threat to public health then it's reasonable for the authorities to know."" The policing minister Kit Malthouse said this week he would dial 111 if he saw his neighbours breaking the rules. Asked if he would grass his Downing Street neighbour if he saw the Chancellor breaking the rules in their shared garden, the PM quipped Rishi was too well behaved. ""I can't imagine that eventuality. ""I have seen Rishi plenty of times in the garden meticulously observing the guidance. Meticulously!"""

Because of the high risk of care home workers spreading infection, they will work in only one home and be compensated for any reduced hours. Money will also be channelled to help limit care home workers' use of public transport and stock up on PPE. Tonight Mr Johnson warned that family visits to care homes may have to be cut off to protect the elderly. He told The Sun: ""Be in no doubt we're going to do absolutely all we can to stop the spread in care homes. ""And I'm afraid it's an incredibly difficult thing, but we are going to have to place some restrictions on people, visitors being able to go into care homes.""

569,569,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson slams ‘abusive’ Brussels for failing to act in good faith over Brexit deal,"BORIS Johnson says the EU is being ""abusive"" to Britain and risking four decades of partnership. The Prime Minister, when asked if Brussels was acting in good faith, replied: ""I don't believe they are."" Mr Johnson told The Sun: ""We assumed our EU friends and partners would want to negotiate in good faith. ""We've been paid up members for 45 years."" His broadside came after a furious spat with the EU over new legislation that could let him overwrite parts of the divorce deal. After 30 Tory MPs refused to vote for the new law, No 10 cut a deal with the rebels to give the Commons a final say on whether to implement powers that would breach the international treaty. Despite branding his exit deal ""oven ready"" last year, Mr Johnson now says he must ""ring-fence it to put in watertight bulkheads that will stop friends and partners making abusive or extreme interpretations of the provisions"". We assumed our EU friends and partners would want to negotiate in good faith. We've been paid up members for 45 years. In defence of the ""otherwise admirable"" Withdrawal Agreement, he doubled down on his claims the EU were using parts of the deal to threaten the UK. Brussels has talked of possibly restricting trade of agricultural goods between the mainland and Northern Ireland. Mocking stubborn EU negotiator Frenchman Michel Barnier's accent, Mr Johnson claimed he asked in talks: ""You're not actually going to blockade our food, are you? ""And they say, 'Oh, no, no, we must see what your regulatory framework is going to be'. ""It's complete nonsense because our regulatory framework is going to be identical to the EU's."""
570,570,The Sun,Nick GutteridgeHarry Cole,Brexit victory as Brussels lets EU banks trade TRILLIONS through London until 2022 — even if there is No Deal,"PANICKING Brussels will let European banks trade trillions through the City of London until 2022 — even if there is No Deal. The UK is the global leader in money market infrastructure with our firms acting as the middlemen for buyers and sellers. But EU banks face being cut off from these vital ""clearing houses"" at the end of the year if Brexit trade talks collapse. Those banks currently ""clear"" £670trillion a year — with the vast majority going through London. With Brussels increasingly scared of an acrimonious split, they shared plans to give Euro firms an 18-month special licence to carry on using London. This is despite years of tough talk with Eurocrats saying they could never approve such a move, and botched attempts to try to poach British expertise away to EU financial powerhouses such as Paris and Frankfurt. It comes amid a major call to arms from Brussels to all 27 EU countries, warning the chances of No Deal was rising and to hike preparedness. A memo calls on embassies to provide the Commission with details of their ""sectors that would be most affected by a No Deal scenario"" — as they draw up last-minute bailout plans. EU capitals are on red alert after Prime Minister Boris Johnson demanded powers to change the Withdrawal Agreement, accusing Brussels of an ""extreme and unreasonable"" interpretation of the deal. Despite a major backlash,Priti Patel said the new powers were needed to ""stay true"" to Northern Ireland in the event of a No Deal. The Home Secretary slapped down Tory critics of the plan to ""overwrite"" part of the deal after 30 Tory MPs failed to vote in the first showdown over the new Internal Marks Bill. No10 was discussing a compromise where MPs would be given a final say on ever using the powers, ahead of a vote next week."
571,571,The Sun,Natasha ClarkHarry Cole,Army barracks will become UK’s first migrant camp after surge in Channel crossings,"AN army barracks is set to become the UK's first migrant camp after a surge in people crossing the Channel. Around 400 asylum seekers will be moved to disused Napier Barracks in Folkestone, Kent, from next week - as the Home Office searches for other MoD sites across the country. The move has angered local officials, who say that they ""cannot support"" the decision. However, the Government has said the measures are designed to save the taxpayer millions on contingency accommodation, with army barracks coming in cheaper than hotel bills. In a joint letter to Home Secretary Priti Patel, Conservative MP Damian Collins along with the leader of Folkestone and Hythe District Council and the chairman of Sandgate Parish Council demanded that the decision be reversed. They said: ""We have great concerns about the impact this large open camp will have on the welfare of the local residential community and also those people in the asylum system who will be placed at the barracks itself."" Meanwhile, Folkestone and Hythe District Council said there had been a ""lack of consultation on this matter and the exceptionally poor communication with us"". They added: ""We are quite sure that members of the community will have many questions, and we are seeking clarification as a matter of urgency."" Among those seeking asylum include a dad who was today pictured carrying his baby below the White Cliffs of Dover. The Home Secretary today said she would consider centres in Calais or in Belgium and other places refugees come through where they could have their asylum claims processed before risking their lives on the journey. Priti Patel told LBC: ""Yes we are. We are looking at all options and these are issues that we are discussing with my counterpart in France."" It came as it was revealed that migrants who make it across the Channel in small boats will be housed in military barracks while their claims are processed. Around 400 people including families are to be housed in temporary accommodation at Napier Barracks in Folkestone, Kent, from next week. Penally Training Camp in Pembrokeshire, West Wales, is also being considered for use. The Home Office said the MoD offered use of the sites in response to a Government plea to secure further accommodation for migrants. It said the barracks were ""value for money"" and gave ""destitute"" asylum seekers a ""suitable"" place to live. But local MP Damian Collins has lashed out at the plans, saying the Home Office must find more ""suitable"" accommodation. He said their ""concentration"" on sites with limited facilities was ""not healthy"". Mr Collins added: ""I can understand why the Home Office don't want to use hotels, but the question is over the number of people in a single location."" Allies of Home Secretary Priti Patel hit back: ""If it's good enough for Our Boys what's he complaining about?"" Some 168 people crossed to the UK in small boats on Monday alone. More than 6,000 migrants have made the desperate journey across the Channel this year. In a statement, Folkestone and Hythe District Council blasted the plans and said they'd not been spoken to about them. They cited a ""lack of consultation on this matter and the exceptionally poor communication with us"" and said they were seeking clarification ""as a matter of urgency"". Ms Patel also said the UK was already returning people ""on a weekly basis"" who came to the UK through EU countries where they could have claimed asylum as part of plans to make the Channel route ""unviable"". Some had even already started asylum claims in other European countries before trying to get to the UK. She said: ""(We will stop refugees) coming to the UK, when they could have claimed asylum in France, in Germany, in Spain or Italy. ""As a result I am sending people, I'm returning people back on weekly basis now, rightly so, people that have come to our country illegally through small boats and we will continue to do that."" The Home Secretary said despite the more hardline approach of sending people back, migrants were still trying to get to the UK and they were looking at even tougher rules to stop them. She said: ""This is not good enough and I've also said this as well, we are looking at fundamental changes that we may need to bring forward legislation to change some of the pull factors that we have here in the United Kingdom."" A UK Government spokesperson said: ""A UK Government spokesperson said: ""During these unprecedented times, the Government is working with a range of partners and across departments to secure further accommodation and the MoD has offered use of some of its sites. ""When using contingency accommodation we work closely with organisations, including local authorities and law enforcement, throughout the process to ensure value for money and that vulnerable asylum seekers, who would otherwise be destitute, have suitable accommodation while their claims are processed."""
572,572,The Sun,Harry ColeJonathan Reilly,Pubs face 9pm curfew if ‘rule of six’ fails to stop rise in coronavirus infections,"PUBS could be forced to shut at 9pm if the ""rule of six"" fails to stop the rise in coronavirus infections. An extra ministerial meeting hastily organised for Tuesday will discuss the rising stats. A source said: ""Curfew is hurtling up the agenda."" Pubs closing early was also ""a tool in the armoury actively under consideration"", another added, though it was not ""imminent"". The measures would anger the Treasury, which is under pressure to extend furlough for the hospitality sector. Greg Mulholland, from the British Pubs Confederation, warned: ""If this happens, the industry will need a massive level of support, through grants and extended furlough. ""Pubs have been diligently following the rules, making sure people sanitise and social distance, and that will be the same at 6pm, 9pm or 11pm. ""These proposals risk destroying the Great British pub."" Bars in lockdown-hit Bolton already have to close early in an attempt to curb the rise in cases in Greater Manchester. Yesterday, hundreds of Brits flouted the new ""rule of six"" laws within hours of them coming into force. Young people were pictured gathering in large groups across the country - as the Policing Minister urged people to snitch on neighbours who break the new law. Angry Tory MPs and cops hit out at the snoop order, warning it will turn us into a nation of score-settling busybodies. Policing Minister Kit Malthouse urged people to call cops if they see groups of more than six. If he saw a breach on his road he said he would call 101 and ""let the police know"". Adults face a £100 on-the-spot fine if they — or their kids —  break the new rule, which kicked in yesterday. But new stats show less than half of Covid fines have been paid. Police Federation boss Ken Marsh said of Mr Malthouse: ""Does he think we have an endless supply of officers who can just go out to these things? ""It will be hundreds and hundreds of calls coming in from curtain twitchers."" The new clampdown measures are being introduced across England to lower the number of people meeting in groups indoors and out. Under the former rules, no more than 30 people can meet inside with up to one other household, but this has been slashed to just six. The new rules also stipulate that the six people can be from different households, in an attempt to bring rules in line with outdoor gatherings. Anyone in your support bubble counts as one household. The rule of six also extends to gatherings organised outside. Ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said busybodies may try to settle scores. He told The Sun: ""Calling on people to spy on each other is not a particularly good situation to be in. ""Police will be inundated and unable to separate out the trivial from the serious. ""They could be snowed under with people trying to get even."" Tory MP Steve Baker blasted the ""Stasi""-like surveillance tactic, warning:  ""East Germany, here we come. The fines can rise to £3,200 for repeat offenders. They cannot be appealed but people can refuse to pay and go to court, risking a criminal record. No10 added further confusion to the rule today by suggesting police officers would not fine people in the first few days of restrictions. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ""What you would expect to happen is for the police to be out today encouraging people to follow the new rules but in the coming days, if we see people continuing to flout the new rules, it is right that people could face a fine. ""The regulations are in place to help to stop the spread of the virus, to protect the NHS and to ultimately save lives."" The new legislation tells Brits they can only meet in groups of up to six people but in certain circumstances are allowed to meet in larger ""gatherings"" as long as they don't ""mingle"" with other people who are not a member of their original group of six. Meanwhile, no tests were available in England's top 10 coronavirus hotspots, according to reports. Health chiefs also warned hospitals are turning away patients because NHS workers are having to stay off because they can't get their results. Hundreds of Brits are being forced to wait more than five days for the outcome. Ministers are now drawing up plans to restrict ""frivolous demands"" for tests as labs battle to clear 185,000 test backlog."
573,573,The Sun,Harry ColeMatt DathanSascha O'Sullivan,Boris Johnson’s crunch Brexit bill PASSES first Commons hurdle despite Tory backlash,"BORIS Johnson's crunch Brexit bill was passed last night - despite a Tory backlash. The PM told MPs Brussels has a ""revolver on the table"" in trade talks,  before he won a vote on his Brexit U-turn. Boris was hit by a backlash from senior Tories over his bid to rip up last year's EU divorce Bill if Brussels tried to exploit Northern Ireland. Former Chancellor Sajid Javid opposed the move and ex-PM David Cameron also broke cover to declare he had ""misgivings"" about the UK breaking a signed treaty. But last night Mr Johnson won the first major Commons battle over his plan to breach international law in a ""limited and specific way"" with a majority of 77. Welcoming the victory, a government spokesman said: ""It will protect the territorial integrity of the UK and the peace in Northern Ireland. ""It is critical we pass this Bill before the end of the year."" But Tory MP Sir Roger Gale voted against the Government as  a ""matter of principle"". He said: ""I believe very strongly we should obey international law."" Earlier, the PM defended his ""safety net"" law. It overwrites parts of his Brussels deal that could see the EU use Northern Ireland to exert control over the UK after Brexit. He told MPs he ""hoped the EU will take this revolver off the table"" and added: ""We cannot have a situation where the very boundaries of our country could be  dictated by a foreign power or international organisation."" Responding for Labour, Ed Miliband raged: ""What incompetence. What failure of governance."" Former PM David Cameron broke cover to declare he had ""misgivings"" about the UK breaking a signed treaty. Whips had been braced for more than a dozen of his MPs threatening to abstain. Earlier, the PM gave a heated defence of his ""safety net"" law that overwrites parts of his Brussels deal that could see the EU use Northern Ireland as a backdoor for control over the UK after Brexit. Ahead of the vote on the Internal Markets Bill Mr Johnson again accused EU negotiators of going to ""extreme and unreasonable lengths"" over Northern Ireland. And he blasted ""absurd and self-defeating"" threats to use an ""extreme interpretation"" of the divorce deal. Mr Johnson said: ""Our interlocutors on the other side are holding out the possibility of blockading food and agriculture transports within our own country."" And he told MPs ""the EU still have not taken this revolver off the table. I still hope that they will do so."" ""We cannot have a situation where the very boundaries of our country could be dictated by a foreign power or international organisation. ""No British Prime Minister, no Government, no Parliament could ever accept such an imposition."" But Sajid Javid — who walked out of Mr Johnson's Government in February — said he could support any move that breaks international law. He was joined by a slew of party grandees including two former Attorney Generals Sir Jermey Wright and Geoffery Cox as well as other party grandees Andrew Mitchell and Sir Bob Neill. And responding for Labour after Sir Keir Starmer was forced to isolate, Ed Miliband raged: ""Is our country going to abide by the rule of law?"" Absurd and self-defeating as that action would be even as we debate this matter, the EU still have not taken this revolver off the table. ""A rules based international order for which we are famous around the world and have always stood up. ""These are not small questions, but go to the heart of who we are as a country and to the character of this government."" Yesterday fellow Conservative MP Rehman Chishti resigned as the PM's special envoy for Freedom of Religion or Belief in opposition to the bill. Mr Chishti, a former barrister, said he had ""real concerns about the UK breaking its legal commitments under the Withdrawal Agreement"". He added: ""I feel strongly we must keep the commitments we make; if we give our word, then we must honour it."" Mr Johnson's former attorney general Mr Cox has slammed the PM for threatening to damage Britain's ""standing and reputation"" on the world stage if he pushes through a law overruling key clauses of the original Brexit deal. Writing in The Times, Mr Cox said: ""No British minister should solemnly undertake to observe treaty obligations with his fingers crossed behind his back. Mr Cox, who oversaw the inking of the original Brexit deal, demanded Mr Johnson ""accept all the ordinary and foreseeable consequences"" of that agreement, and said he would not vote for the bill. The controversial law, which will be voted on in the House of Commons today, overrides parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol, which prevented a hard border."
574,574,The Sun,Harry Cole,Ministers publish legal advice justifying their new Internal Markets Bill as not ‘unconstitutional’,"MINISTERS published legal advice yesterday justifying their new Internal Markets Bill despite admitting it breaches international law - and they thumbed their nose at Remainers with it. The legal document cited ultra-remain campaigner Gina Miller's successful suing of the Government over Brexit as a precedent. Remainers gave the government a bloody nose in 2017 after their case forced ministers to get Parliamentary approval to trigger Brexit. Downing Street's lawyers pointed out that Miller's case proved Parliament's will trumped international treaties and used their bitter sweet victory against them. Although ministers admit their plan would breach international law, yesterday the Government published legal advice stating it was not ""unconstitutional"" as Parliament is ""sovereign as a matter of domestic law and can pass legislation which is in breach of the UK's treaty obligations"". But the Internal Markets Bill, that drives a coach and horses through the Withdrawal Agreement, faces a tricky passage through the House of Lords. Even Brexit backing peers Lord Howard and Lord Lamont balked at the measures last night. The Former Chancellor Lord Lamont said Downing Street was in a ""terrible mess"" over the plan. He said: ""I think the Government will have to think again. I don't think this is going to get through the Lords in its present form. ""I think the Government had an arguable case but that case was destroyed the moment Brandon Lewis said the means the Government were going to use to change the Northern Ireland protocol was against international law. ""That is impossible to defend."""
575,575,The Sun,Harry ColeNick Gutteridge,EU threatens to take UK to court if Boris Johnson does not stick to Brexit divorce deal,"THE EU is threatening to take the UK to court if Boris Johnson does not stick to the Brexit divorce deal. Brussels insisted the PM must ditch plans to rip up parts of the Withdrawal Agreement by the end of the month. It threatened to sue the UK for hundreds of millions and collapse trade talks if he does not. The UK has published a bill to rewrite parts of the deal signed in January. EU boss Maros Sefcovic issued the ultimatum at crisis talks in London on Thursday. He said that Britain must ditch the planned new UK law that would ""overwrite"" the exit terms — or abandon any hope of a trade deal before the end of the transition period in December. He added: ""Violating the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement would break international law, undermine trust and put at risk ongoing future relationship negotiations."" He warned that the EU ""would not be shy"" to use legal remedies to pursue Britain with potentially limitless fines for breaching a treaty. But at the heated talks, Cabinet minister Michael Gove told Mr Sefcovic that Britain ""could not and would not"" back down. He said later: ""I made it perfectly clear to vice president Sefcovic that we would not be withdrawing this legislation. He understood that. Of course he regretted it."" The eighth round of trade talks broke up on Thursday. UK chief Brexit negotiator Lord Frost said: ""These were useful exchanges. However, a number of challenging areas remain and the divergences on some are still significant."" THERE seems no limit to the self-harm the EU will inflict in its 11th-hour bid to prevent Britain becoming fully independent. It says there will be trade sanctions and legal action if we don't kowtow. This from the outfit which reneged on its written promises to make a trade deal respecting us as a sovereign nation. Its Democrat allies in Washington clumsily wade in, vowing to kill any UK-US trade deal too. But Boris can't cave in to blackmail. And voters will back him. Brits don't like being bullied. Buckle up for a painful Brexit divorce."
576,576,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Meddling Covid marshals will be able to tell people which way to walk down the street,"NANNYING Covid marshals will be able to tell people which way to walk down the street. Ministers want to task the army of uniformed busybodies with ""directing pedestrians, providing information, cleaning touch-points, preventing mixing between groups and being a point of contact for information on government guidelines"". They will also give out hand sanitiser and face coverings but not be able to slap rule-breakers with fines for bad behaviour. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ""We are encouraging the introduction of Covid-secure marshals to help support our high streets and public spaces, making sure that people feel safe to enjoy them."" And they insisted the new marshals will  make sure the public are ""following the guidelines in a friendly way"" after claims the Government is unleashing a ""Stasi"" style clampdown on Britain's streets. There has been mystery around exactly what powers the marshals will have after the Prime Minister announced their creation on Wednesday while issuing sweeping curbs on freedoms to tackle soaring Covid cases. Boris Johnson told a Downing Street press conference: ""We will boost the local enforcement capacity of local authorities by introducing Covid-secure marshals to help ensure social distancing in town and city centres, and by setting up a register of environmental health officers that local authorities can draw upon for support."" But the Local Government Association said on Thursday: ""We need to quickly see further detail on how the Government's Covid-19-secure marshal scheme is intended to work, and any new responsibilities for councils in this area will have to be fully funded."" MHCLG responded: ""Some areas of the country have already introduced marshals to support the public in following the guidelines in a friendly way and we will be working with local authorities to see where else they are needed. We will be setting out further details in due course."" Marshals have already been deployed by Leeds City Council and Cornwall Council. Other local authorities will now be ""encouraged"" to hire marshals, or use volunteers and existing council employees, with money from their own budgets, a MHCLG spokeswoman said. They said they would probably wear high-visibility clothing to ""support members of the public in one-way systems and remind them of guidelines"". But the latest Coronavirus measures have been branded the ""greatest invasion of personal liberty in our entire history"" beyond what happened in World War Two by a former Supreme Court judge. Lord Sumption - nicknamed Britain's cleverest man - savaged plans like the  marshals saying people are going to be too scared to go back to work. He said: ""If you are going to inaugurate the greatest invasion of personal liberty in our entire history, even including wartime measures, if you dare to do that, then you have to move straight into justification mode. ""The government has now found itself trapped in a position where, first of all, it has to exaggerate the extent of the problem in order to justify its past actions. ""And secondly, by exaggerating the scale of the problem, it is contributing to the difficulty that it now faces in persuading people to go back to school and back to work, because naturally what people ask is, well, what has changed since?"" He added: ""The use of fear has, of course, been noticed by many people. And some members of Sage have made public statements since then saying that this was perhaps overdone, but it was a matter of deliberate policy, as it quite clearly was. He told the Telegraph: ""What you have to remember is that when societies lose liberty, it is not because liberty has been crushed under the boot of some tyrant. It's usually because they've been frightened into giving it up voluntarily."""
577,577,The Sun,Nick GutteridgeHarry Cole,Boris Johnson hits back over EU claim he’s turning UK into ‘rogue state’ by altering withdrawal agreement,"BORIS Johnson accused Brussels of ""extreme or irrational interpretations"" of last year's EU divorce deal. It came in a blistering defence over claims he is turning the UK into a ""rogue state"" by attempting to alter the withdrawal agreement. The PM spoke out after The Sun revealed EU negotiators were threatening to use the small print to cut off British imports to Northern Ireland if current trade talks collapse. The Government published legislation that would allow No10 in return to scrap some checks on goods, as well as ignore EU state aid law on the mainland. Mr Johnson told MPs it provided a ""legal safety net"" for the internal UK market. And he insisted ""nobody wants to see a barrier down the Irish Sea"" which would be ""very, very injurious"". Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis admitted on Tuesday that the attempt to ""clarify"" parts of the agreement breaks international law in a ""very specific and limited way"". Breaking international law is not acceptable and does not create the confidence we need to build our future relationship."" But Brussels described it as a ""full frontal assault"" on the deal that Mr Johnson signed less than a year ago. And they warned the chances of a trade agreement are now ""small"" as relations between the two sides plummet to a four-year low. EU boss Charles Michel fumed: ""Breaking international law is not acceptable and does not create the confidence we need to build our future relationship."" Irish leader Michael Martin spoke to Mr Johnson on the phone to lodge his ""very strong concerns"". France's Europe minister Clement Beaune said: ""Among friends and allies, we must keep our word and respect the law."" Remainer and former Prime Minister Sir John Major added: ""If we lose our reputation for honouring the promises we make, we will have lost something beyond price that may never be regained."""
578,578,The Sun,Harry ColeNatasha ClarkKate FergusonMatt Dathan,Boris Johnson speech: Boris bans gatherings of over 6 in crackdown that could see Christmas cancelled,"BORIS Johnson all but cancelled a normal Christmas with sweeping new curbs on social gatherings. The PM said it was necessary to halt coronavirus's alarming spread — after Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty revealed infections were soaring among the young. He warned that people flouting the clampdown — including bans on social gatherings of more than six — could even be arrested. In his first press conference since July, the PM announced moves to ramp up enforcement of the tough rules to make sure everyone is following them - or they risk being slapped with fines of at least £100. And medical experts warned that a second spike in coronavirus was being fuelled by young people failing to follow the rules on social distancing and hygiene. Boris said yesterday he hoped we ""could"" get things back to normal by Christmas with the Government's plans to roll out mass testing in the coming weeks and months. But Government scientists fear the rules are likely to remain for at least three months - and could be in place for six. It was revealed yesterday: From Monday people in England will be unable to gather in groups of more than six - including children - and if they do they could even be arrested. The laws will apply indoors and outdoors, after police chiefs said that the rules were too confusing for people to follow. Weddings, funerals, workplaces and some other gatherings will be exempt from the rules. The PM apologised for having to take such measures, and said it ""breaks my heart"" to have to stop families from being able to see each other. He said: ""I wish that we did not have to take this step. But as your Prime Minister, I must do what is necessary to stop the spread of the virus and save lives."" And he promised he will only keep the strict rules in place ""as long as necessary"", but said it was ""just too early to say"" how long they will be need to stay for. It means that grandparents and grandchildren may not be able to spend Christmas together if the rules stay in place until then. Pilots for rapid 20-minute results tests - nicknamed Operation Moonshot will be trialled in Salford in the coming weeks which would ""lead to more normal lives without the need for social distancing"" and allow people to go to work knowing they were safe. The Government also now believes that the R rate is now above one as the rate of infections is increasing so rapidly. They fear that without yesterday's radical intervention, Britain will follow in the footsteps of France and Spain, where a second wave of coronavirus started among young people but then spread to the elderly. ""This is to avoid a second national lockdown,"" Boris declared. Mr Whitty unveiled a series of graphs showing the grave situation facing the UK. And he warned: ""Now we can see this spreading across the whole country. ""This is not just in a very small number of places this is the whole country."" He was more pessimistic than the PM, telling the nation: ""The period between now and spring is going to be difficult. You shouldn't just see this as a very short term thing."" Partying youngsters who are flouting social distancing while down the boozer are behind the Covid surge, boffins believe. But kids who have headed back to school over the past week are not fuelling the spike, Professor Whitty said. Alarming numbers show that England's Covid infection rates have rocketed from 12.5 per 100,000 last week, to 19.7 this week. But the rate is far higher among Brits in their late teens and 20s. Among 17 to 18 year-olds it stands at a staggering 48.1 per 100,000. Among 19 to 21 year-olds it is even higher at 54.5, while among 20 to 29 year-old it is 41.6 per 100,000. But it is no higher among school age children. Senior scientists fear soaring numbers of Brits will end up in hospital and could even die from Covid unless infection rates are quickly and drastically slashed. Boris begged: ""For the sake of yours and your grandparents health, don't socially gather in groups of more than six now, and when term starts."" Universities will also be told NOT to send students home in the event of another outbreak, he revealed. Boris also confirmed that the Government was putting plans for live sport to return back under review. Clubs were due to let in a quarter of their stadium's capacity from October 1 under plans to socially distance fans. The move delivers a major blow for millions of football fans ahead of the start of the 2020/21 football season, which starts this weekend. However he stressed ""it doesn't mean we will scrap it entirely"", promising more information soon. Some of the current sporting events that are carrying out pilots for the return of fans will still go ahead - such as horse racing, cricket and some football games. Any pilots that do take place will have to have a limit of 1000 people. Doncaster racecourse stop spectators from attending its St Leger festival event after the warnings from the PM and public health leaders. Travellers will be banned from entering the UK unless they've filled out track and trace forms under new government plans. Ministers aim to make the form a ""condition of travel"" to free up Border Force staff so that they can focus on enforcing those who have to quarantine. Officials are working with airlines to make sure passengers cannot board a plane if they haven't filled out the form. They will also make sure the form matches up to booking data – to make sure people don't put down fake addresses. The new system is similar to Greece, which bans tourists from entering unless they have filled out the form 24 hours before travel, and shown the form at the check in desk. The government will also hire a ""Dad's Army"" of recently retired and newly qualified Environmental Health Officers to crack down on those ignoring rules in town and city centres. An army of Covid Secure Marshalls will patrol the streets to make sure rules are being enforced. And they will also snoop on pubs and restaurants to ensure they are all taking punter's details so they can be tracked and traced in the event of an outbreak Hospitality venues which are found flouting the rules will be fined £1000."
579,579,The Sun,Jonathan ReillyHarry Cole,Firebrand Chinese Ambassador to the UK ‘likes’ porn tweet on his official account,"The Chinese ambassador to Britain put his foot in it after he liked an X-rated clip on his official Twitter account. Firebrand Liu Xiaoming is known for spouting his nation's rhetoric on Hong Kong, Coronavirus and the treatment of Uighur Muslims in China, but late last night he used the social network for more personal perusal. The top Communist diplomat ""liked"" a ten-second clip of a woman wearing stockings performing a sex act too rude to describe in a family newspaper. The clip in Chinese is roughly translated as: ""Lucky quality single guy, warm up first."" The Chinese language account is for fans of ""Beautiful legs in stockings."" It was on show for all his 83,500 followers all morning before being removed In a statement, the Chinese Embassy said his account had been hacked using ""despicable methods."" They said: ""Recently, some anti-China elements viciously attacked Ambassador Liu Xiaoming's Twitter account and employed despicable methods to deceive the public. ""The Chinese Embassy strongly condemns such abominable behaviour."" The Embassy added: ""The Embassy has reported this to Twitter company and urged the latter to make thorough investigations and handle this matter seriously. ""The Embassy reserves the right to take further actions and hope that the public will not believe or spread such rumour."" After the statement Mr Liu tweeted: ""A good anvil does not fear the hammer."" Mr Liu has the face of China as relations between London and Beijing have soured over the last few months. He has repeatedly accused the UK is ""dancing to USA's tune"" after Boris Johnson banned Chinese tech firm Huawei from Britain's 5G networks. He also accused Westminster of ""interfering"" in Chinese affairs when the  government announced it would suspend an extradition treaty with Hong Kong after the communist state imposed draconian new security laws. In July the ambassador praised the ""beauty"" of Xinjiang after being shown a video of blindfolded and shackled Muslim prisoners being forced onto a train on the Andrew Marr show."
580,580,The Sun,Harry ColeNick Gutteridge,Brussels threatened to block British food exports to Northern Ireland in Brexit power play,"BRUSSELS threatened to disrupt food exports from mainland Britain to Northern Ireland as negotiating leverage, The Sun can reveal. The incendiary trade talks power play infuriated the UK side and helped trigger their bombshell bid to make legal changes to the Withdrawal Agreement. Trade talks were in meltdown tonight after the Northern Ireland Secretary admitted Britain will break the law to tweak the exit terms signed by Boris Johnson just last year. Brandon Lewis unleashed an international firestorm after he starkly told the Commons the UK wants to rip up a signed treaty in ""a very specific and limited way"". His confession triggered outrage from both senior Tory and Labour MPs as well as key EU figures - with Britain compared to a ""rogue state"". And the Government's top lawyer Jonathan Jones quit, refusing to sign off the proposed new legislation that would make the changes. But The Sun has learnt that London's attempt to ""clarify"" parts of the 2019 exit treaty came after what they saw as veiled threats from Michel Barnier's team that the EU could exploit parts of the Withdrawal Agreement if the UK did not bow to their trade deal demands. Under the terms of the deal export of ""products of animal origin"" such as meat, fish, shellfish, eggs and dairy from the UK mainland over to Northern Ireland will become subject to EU oversight. The EU has a ""Third Country"" list of approved third parties that can legally import agricultural goods into areas subject to their rules. The UK being put on that approved list was assumed to be a given and not subject to negotiation, but Brits were left seething after Michel Barnier's team hinted the UK may not be given that legal status if talks collapse. In a No Deal scenario it left open the chance that the EU could declare food exports from Great Britain to Northern Ireland illegal. The perceived threat prompted ministers to demand a ""safety net"" to address the problem with new domestic legislation. But Britain's attempts to rework some elements of the Withdrawal Agreement through UK law have plunged trade talks - that both sides say must conclude next month - into fresh chaos. A furious Michel Barnier is set to travel London tomorrow to demand an explanation  for the attempted changes from our negotiator David Frost. EU sources said the Frenchman wants No10 to ""tell it to our face"" if it plans to rip up the Withdrawal Agreement. One said: ""We're not going to give certain elements in the Tory party the satisfaction of us being the ones to walk away."" Brussels sources say the UK's third party status can only be granted once more detail is given on what food standards will be after Brexit. The two chief negotiators didn't speak today despite the escalating crisis threatening to derail the talks. There was a chorus of condemnation for the plan on both sides of the Channel. Nathalie Loiseau, a former French Europe minister who now sits on the EU Parliament's Brexit committee, said: ""You don't break international law in a specific and limited way. ""You do break it or you don't. You can't be half illegal, as you can't be half pregnant."" In the Commons, former Prime Minister Theresa May warned the Government was in danger of losing the trust of other countries that it would honour its international agreements while Labour described the admission as ""absolutely astonishing"". Downing Street has sought to play down the changes in the Internal Market Bill - to be tabled tomorrow - insisting they were simply ""limited clarifications""."
581,581,The Sun,Harry ColeNick Gutteridge,Boris Johnson blasts EU claims he was planning to tear up Withdrawal Agreement,"BORIS Johnson has rubbished EU claims he was planning to rip up the Withdrawal Agreement, as a massive war of words exploded over Brexit. Trade talks with Brussels were last night hanging by a thread after both sides threatened to pull out over the row. Ahead of face to face talks in London starting today, the EU erupted over suggestions the PM wanted to tear up 2019's Withdrawal Agreement. Brussels was enraged after the Financial Times claimed the UK wanted to ""overwrite"" parts of last year's exit deal to water down checks on goods flowing between Northern Ireland and the British mainland. Despite denials from the Government that they were just seeking legal ""clarity"", Bernd Lange, chairman of the EU Parliament trade committee, said the talks are ""doomed"" if the UK breaks its word. He fumed: ""We will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed."" And he accused Boris Johnson of turning the talks into a ""farce"" with ""tactical games"". Top EU negotiator Michel Barnier said talks would end if the Withdrawal Agreement - and particularly the Northern Ireland Protocol, which avoids a hard border - were not honoured. But London insisted they were merely seeing off back-door control from Brussels in the venet of No Deal and warned the EU to negotiate at pace. The row is centred on claims Britain is attempting to change the agreement over what goods will be liable for checks when travelling into Northern Ireland. An official list is being drawn up by a Joint Committee of what goods might end up in the EU by moving through the province and via the Irish republic land border. The UK/EU group have been meeting regularly all year to hammer out the list, but the UK fears the list will not be ready by the end of the year. If talks collapse, Britain wants to be able to decide what goods are exempt from cross-border tariffs that would go up in a No Deal scenario. But Brussels argue they want a level of control to decide if their import taxes apply too. No10 insisted they are just trying to avoid legal chaos in a No Deal scenario rather than backslide on previous promises. An angry official hit back: ""The government is completely committed, as it always has been, to implementing the Northern Ireland Protocol in good faith."" A new law will be published this week that sets out Britain's position — with No10 arguing it had to come this week in order to get through Parliament by December. However last night European leaders warned time was running out. BOTH Boris Johnson and Brussels say trade talks are stuck on major issues — state aid, fish and Northern Ireland — but both agree a deal has to be done by next month. So what are the sticking points really about? Q: Why October? A: Brussels says a deal is needed by October 31 at the latest if the EU Parliament is to have enough time to scrutinise and vote on it. The PM agrees — setting an even earlier October 15 deadline. Both sides agree firms need to be given enough time to prepare. Q: What is state aid? A: State aid is financial assistance given to individual businesses or certain sectors of the economy by the Government. Brussels does not want the UK to give domestic companies an unfair advantage after Brexit. But Mr Johnson says it's our right to do what we want as an independent nation. Q: Why the row over fish? A: UK trawlermen say they have suffered for years under the bloc's Common Fisheries Policy. No10 wants to change how quotas are divvied up, doubling the spoils for our fishermen. But EU bosses say the result will wipe out a third of the EU's fleet. Q: What is the NI Protocol? A: It's a legal fix bolted on to last year's Brexit deal to make sure there's no return to a hard border in Ireland. Both sides agreed Northern Ireland will, in effect, stay in the EU's single market. But a row has broken out over what would happen in a No Deal scenario. Q: What does the UK want? A: The UK wants to exempt some goods heading from GB to NI, such as supermarket products and live animals, from some checks and automatic tariffs. It is also seeking a workaround on EU rules which will mean all companies sending items from NI to GB will have to fill out exit declarations. Q: What does the EU want? A: In a recent speech Michel Barnier vowed to make sure the EU's customs code is ""applied in its entirety"" for all goods entering and leaving NI. Q: How does this affect talks? A: EU boss Ursula von der Leyen says there will be no trade deal unless the Protocol is honoured in full. Q: What happens next? A: The two sides will meet in London today. If the UK and EU cannot reach an agreement by the end of the year, full tariffs and quotas will be applied to all goods traded between the UK and the EU. France's Europe Minister, Clement Beaune, warned there's now ""a high risk"" of no deal unless the UK backs down. But UK Chief Negotiator Lord Frost hit back: ""We need to see more realism from the EU about our status as an independent country. ""As we have done from the beginning in public and in private, I will reinforce our simple, reasonable request for a free trade agreement based on those the EU has signed before with like-minded partners."""

Addressing top officers tomorrow, Priti Patel will speak of her revulsion at police killers who ""laugh in the face of the law"". And the Home Secretary will unveil the new Police Covenant to protect police, staff and families of those slain in action. It will focus on physical protection, health and wellbeing, and family support. The new law to enshrine the protections for the police is similar to those that already exist for the military. Following meetings with PC Harper's widow Lissie, the covenant will have a special focus on police families as well as frontline officers and backroom staff. PC Harper was dragged to his death by a getaway car after a burglary in Berkshire last year. The covenant will address major inconsistencies across forces in terms of financial and emotional support for families of officers killed in the line of duty. Ms Patel will tell the Police Superintendents' Association: ""The police and the families that stand behind them deserve special recognition. ""Their bravery and sacrifices are what keep us and our loved ones safe. ""I will put the Police Covenant in law to ensure they will always have the support of the nation."" The law will give ministers a statutory duty to do more to support the police and the Home Secretary will have to report annually to MPs on it. Welcoming the new law, Paul Griffiths, president of the Police Superintendents' Association, said: ""The Police Covenant will provide formal recognition and a sign of clear value to the families of officers and staff who have made sacrifices in carrying out their duties."" He added: ""This important step forward will ensure that our duty to our people begins to mirror that of our duty to the public."" THE widow of PC Andrew Harper is pushing for cross-party support in her campaign for life sentences for those who kill emergency services workers. Lissie Harper will meet Shadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds on Tuesday to discuss the proposals. It follows her meeting with Home Secretary Priti Patel and Justice Secretary Robert Buckland, at which they offered their support. Lissie said: ""Cross-party support is so important to us. It's something that we all need to do together."""

Boris Johnson has set a mid-October deadline to get a new deal inked to avoid tariffs on cross border trade after Brexit, but a furious row broke out today putting that in doubt. Brussels have threatened to pull stumps on the talks over allegations Britain was trying to water down agreements over the Northern Irish border signed by Mr Johnson last year. EU diplomats were left stunned after the FT claimed the Prime Minister wants to overwrite parts of last year's Withdrawal Agreement to water down checks on goods flowing between Northern Ireland and the British mainland. One said such a move would ruin Britain's reputation on the world stage, adding: ""It would be a desperate and ultimately self-defeating strategy."" EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said full implementation of the border agreement is a ""prerequisite for any future partnership"" with the EU. And Michel Barnier said talks would end if the Withdrawal Agreement and its crucial Northern Ireland Protocol that avoids a hard border were not honoured. His spokesman suggested the Frenchman will walk away from the talks if the UK doesn't live up to its commitments. But London insisted they were merely seeing off backdoor control from Brussels if no deal is done with legal ""tidying up loose ends"". Today No10 moved to scotch the row, insisting they are just trying to avoid legal chaos in a No Deal scenario rather than backslide on previous promises.

The official said: ""If we don't take these steps we face the prospect of legal confusion at the end of the year and potentially extremely damaging defaults, including tariffs on goods moving from GB to Northern Ireland. ""We are making minor clarifications in extremely specific areas to ensure that, as we implement the protocol, we are doing so in a way that allows ministers to always uphold and protect the Good Friday peace agreement."" And Boris Johnson's official spokesman added: ""We will continue to work with the EU in the Joint Committee to resolve outstanding issues with the Northern Ireland Protocol. ""However, as a responsible Government, we cannot allow the peace process or the UK's internal market to inadvertently be compromised by unintended consequences of the protocol.

584,584,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Horny prisoners spend £25k on sex chatlines & leave Ministry of Justice with the bill,"HORNY jailbirds spent £25,000 on sex chatlines — and landed the Ministry of Justice with the bill. Mobiles given to prisoners on probation were blocked from making premium-rate calls. But a handful of canny inmates worked out that you could request a call back by text — effectively reversing the charges — and the taxpayer was left to pick up the tab. Nine lags spent more than £2,000 each on the scam, despite the phone provider assuring MoJ chiefs the devices were secure. Furious ministers had to cut a deal with the network to claw back the cash. The ruse came about when, as part of special measures relating to coronavirus, thousands of prisoners were let out on licence. They were given basic mobiles that could only receive incoming calls while they were on the outside. But officials were baffled when they were slapped with a mega invoice for their use. A government source said Justice Secretary Robert Buckland ""hit the roof"" when he discovered the cost had come from sex chatlines. The insider added: ""The Secretary of State was completely livid on hearing about this screw-up as he had been assured these phones could not be used to make calls. ""He told the officials in no uncertain terms that the taxpayers should not pay a single penny of this sordid bill — and to be fair to all involved, we've got the right result now."" It is understood the mobile phone provider waived the bill in full."
585,585,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Civil servants blasted for ignoring Boris Johnson’s calls to return to their desks as coronavirus threat fades,"WHITEHALL chiefs have rebuked civil servants for not returning to their desks as the coronavirus threat fades. An urgent order has been sent to 480,000 Westminster officials. They were warned that PM Boris Johnson would be monitoring weekly statistics on the numbers returning to work. Chiefs demanded that 80 per cent of staff in Westminster return for at least two days a week by the end of this month. Departments that do not shape up face being named and shamed on their data. Mr Johnson and his ministers were incensed after civil servants ignored previous pleas to return and set an example to the nation. Now a letter from Head of the Civil Service Sir Mark Sedwill and Cabinet Office boss Alex Chisholm has demanded they up their game. It urged officials to ""take advantage of the return to schools this month and increased public transport availability"" and get back to the office to make use of the ""significant benefits"" of not working from home. It warned: ""In the coming weeks we will be monitoring closely the performance of all departments against this objective."" The missive came as the PM again urged workers to return to Britain's deserted towns and cities. Mr Johnson admitted that working from home had been ""magnificent and definitely enhanced people's quality of life in many, many ways"". THE number of adults travelling to work — either exclusively or in combination with home working — rose to 57 per cent last week compared with 49 per cent in June, data from the Office for National Statistics shows. But he said now was the time to use the railways and get back to the office. It emerged last night that millions could get a free ride into London. Tickets in and around the capital for trains, buses and the Tube are being considered as part of a First Ride Free scheme designed to get the public to see for themselves that it is safe to return to the office."
586,586,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor","Eat Out To Help Out will come back next year, hints Chancellor Rishi Sunak","EAT Out To Help Out could come back as an economic downturn treat, the Chancellor has hinted. As new figures show 100 MILLION discount meals were served up in August, Rishi Sunak privately told Tory MPs economic boosting measures could be turned on again next year. Initial figures released by the Treasury revealed that restaurant bookings surged as a result of the stimulus programme designed to boost Britain's struggling restaurants and pubs. Diners received a state-backed 50% discount on meals and soft drinks up to £10 each between Mondays and Wednesdays in August. The final day of the scheme, Monday August 31, saw a 216% jump in bookings compared to the equivalent day in 2019, according to initial data from OpenTable. By the end of Monday, 130,000 claims were made by 84,700 restaurants signed up to the programme, with claims costing the taxpayer around £522 million. Chancellor Rishi Sunak hailed the programme as a ""success"" after coronavirus gutted the hospitality sector. And The Sun can reveal he hinted to Tory MPs that the scheme could make a comeback if the economic recovery is sluggish. Asked in a private meeting with Conservatives on Wednesday what measures could be used to help a slow comeback, the Chancellor told colleagues ""we know in the short term we can use the tax system to drive economic activity, and depending on how the shape of the recovery is we can look to do more of that."" One Tory MP present told The Sun: ""It was pretty clear he meant more Eat Out, everyone loves it."" Hailing the final figures, Mr Sunak said: ""From the get-go our mission has been to protect jobs, and to do this we needed to be creative, brave and try things that no government has ever done before. ""I want to thank everyone, from restaurant owners to waiters, chefs and diners, for embracing it and helping drive our economic recovery. ""The scheme is just one part of our plan for jobs and we will continue to protect, support and create jobs to ensure we come back stronger as a nation."" Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said: ""The Eat Out To Help Out scheme has been a great success for hospitality. ""Our members have reported very strong bookings throughout August at a time when the sector really needed a boost. ""It has helped provide a lift in consumer confidence which is going to be key for hospitality businesses as they look to reopen and help rebuild the economy."" RISHI Sunak must learn from the staggering success of his own Eat Out scheme. Lower prices caused a 216 per cent leap in restaurant bookings over the same day last year, despite Covid. It's the same with taxes. Cut them — and growth and jobs will come. Raise them and the rot will set in."
587,587,The Sun,Harry Cole,SNP spark fury after blocking UK plans to give lie detector tests to terrorists,"SCOTLAND is blocking UK plans to give terrorists lie detector tests as a condition of parole, The Sun can reveal. Tough new laws tightening up early release for prisoners convicted of terror offences have been drawn up by the UK Government. But Nicola Sturgeon's SNP ministers are refusing to implement a key plank — polygraphing jihadis to check they are not fibbing about being reformed characters. The Counter Terror and Sentencing Bill will see a minimum sentence of 14 years slapped on terror offences. The clampdown was ordered after terrorist Usman Khan brutally murdered two probation volunteers near London Bridge last November. Last night the UK's independent reviewer of terror legislation Jonathan Hall QC published a long awaited report into the failings that allowed crazed Khan to kill while on parole. He said: ""Polygraph testing is a sensible additional tool for obtaining information relevant to risk posed by Terrorist Offenders."" ""The results are likely to assist in determining whether the offender is complying with their licence conditions… and can assist police to consider risk factors"". But a furious row has broken out between Edinburgh and London after Scottish Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf rejected a request from the UK Government to implement terror detector tests in Scotland. Because Justice is a devolved issue, UK ministers need to seek a Legislative Consent Motion - permission from Scottish ministers to amend Scottish law - but the SNP administration are saying no. Despite the expert opinion, Scottish Justice minister Humza Yousaf wrote in a letter to the UK Government that he was  ""unconvinced by policy merits of the use of polygraph in Scotland."" But leading Scottish Conservative Andrew Bowie branded the SNP behaviour ""an utter disgrace"". The West Aberdeenshire MP added: ""Typical SNP: weak on terroism, weak on security."" The SNP were slammed in 2009 after letting out the Lockerbie bomber amid claims he was on death's door, only to see Abdelbaset al-Megrahi live for nearly three years back in Libya. Mr Bowie added: ""When you look back on the history of the SNP and terrorists - not least the release of the Lockerbie bomber - they have consistently been weak on protecting the safety of Scots."" And he urged Scottish ministers to ""immediately take action to make sure this important law is applied across the entire United Kingdom or Scotland will be left weaker than England and Wales."" Dr Alan Mendoza of the security think tank the Henry Jackson Society warned the row risked ""creating a two-tier system of release that threatens the security of the whole UK."" A Scottish Government source claimed a call to discuss the issue yesterday was cancelled at the ""last minute"" by the UK Government and ""will be rearranged"". The insider added: ""We have stated our concerns on the polygraph testing to them."" The Ministry of Justice confirmed plans to polygraph terror convicts, but declined to comment on the row."
588,588,The Sun,Natasha ClarkHarry Cole,BBC Proms row: Boris Johnson hails U-turn & blasts ‘orgy of national embarrassment’ in censoring history,"BORIS Johnson has called for an end to the ""orgy of national embarrassment"" about Britain's history after the BBC U-turned on their ""crazy"" censorship of patriotic Proms songs. The Beeb scrapped the singing of the historic tunes over their perceived links to colonialism and slavery but today reversed their decision after a public outcry. Pleased to see common sense has prevailed on the BBC Proms In one of the first acts in charge, new BBC boss Tim Davie lifted the woke ban on Rule Britannia and Land of Hope and Glory being sung at this year's Last Night of the Proms. After major backlash over their fears of upsetting politically correct campaigners with the crowd pleasers, the new Director General climbed down and said the annual singalong must be ""special and a Last Night truly to remember."" The Sun revealed at the weekend that the new BBC boss was considering a U-turn after the ""terrible damage"" to the corporation. Last week the PM had entered the row, too, by blasting the ""cringing embarrassment"" over Britain's history. Today the BBC finally backed down and said ""both pieces will now include a select group of BBC singers"". A statement from the Beeb added: ""We have been looking hard at what else might be possible and we have a solution. ""This means the words will be sung in the Hall, and as we have always made clear, audiences will be free to sing along at home."" It won't be a full choir and there will be no audience due to Covid-19 fears. Mr Davie's decision was hailed by politicians from across the political spectrum. The PM told Tory MPs this afternoon: ""I do think this country is going through an orgy of national embarrassment about some of the things that other people around the world love most about us. ""People love our traditions and our history with all its imperfections. It's crazy for us to go around trying to censor it. ""It's absolutely absurd and I think we should speak out loud and proud for the UK and our history."" It's absolutely absurd and I think we should speak out loud and proud for the UK and our history. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden also welcomed the decision after piling pressure on the Beeb to change tack. He said: ""Pleased to see common sense has prevailed on the BBC Proms."" A Cabinet source said they were delighted with Mr Davie's ""new broom"" at the BBC and said it was clear the new Director General was determined to make his own mark on the corporation. Government insiders directly attributed the climbdown to Mr Davie. Actor Laurence Fox, who had been leading the campaign for the Beeb to u-turn, said: ""WE BLOODY DID IT! ""You are all amazing! They have to listen if we speak loud enough. Well done. I'm so happy!"" And Brexit boss Nigel Farage said at the development: ""This just shows the power of public pressure and how hopelessly out of touch the BBC are with their own licence fee payers."" Even Labour boss Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the decision. Sir Keir's spokesman said: ""It is the right decision, we said a few weeks ago the pomp and pageantry is a staple of the British summer."" And former Labour big beast turned TV star Ed Balls said it was a ""good decision"". Andrew Bridgen added: ""The Great British public forced the BBC to yield. Rule Britannia."" Brits reacted with delight, too. Garry Bennett said: ""Common sense at last. Was always going to happen after the outcry. ""Stupid BBC for even thinking nothing would be said..."" Nicola Moore added: ""YES! Should never have had to have the debate in the first place."" Jenny Clapton said: ""So it should be! Absolutely ludicrous to try and stop it in the first place."" It was reported yesterday that the new BBC chief had threatened to axe comedy shows for being too left wing. Davie is reportedly set to axe a series of shows, and in his first speech on Thursday will try to restore ""trust and confidence"" in the BBC. He's also reported to be prepared to clamp down on presenters cashing in and working for private companies or hosting posh corporate events. Davie is reported to be considering making corporation stars declare any outside earnings. The corporation faced a huge backlash over the decision not to allow Rule Britannia to be sung at the Proms. The Beeb said ""artistic reasons"" were behind its decision amid claims it acted over the song's links to our colonial past. But insiders had told The Sun: ""Tim's immediate priority will be to undo the terrible damage done by Tony. ""Tim has a chance to do a big, crowd-pleasing U-turn on a policy that is wildly unpopular."" ""Tim has already insisted on an announcement making clear that Rule Britannia will be sung at next year's Proms. ""With Tony gone, he now has a chance to do a big, crowd-pleasing U-turn on a policy that is wildly unpopular."" The ex-BBC chairman Michael Grade had also previously blasted the decision not to sing at the Proms, saying the corporation was ""too trapped in the Westminster bubble"" and has called everything wrong from the referendum to last year's election."" When Britain first, at Heaven's commandArose from out the azure mainArose, arose from out the azure main;This was the charter, the charter of the land,And guardian angels sang this strain:""Rule Britannia! Britannia rule the waves:""Britons never, never, never will be slaves."" The nations, not so blest as thee,Must, in their turns, to tyrants fallMust, in their turns, to tyrants fall;While thou shalt flourish, shalt flourish great and free,The dread and envy of them all. ""Rule Britannia! Britannia rule the waves:""Britons never, never, never will be slaves."" Still more majestic shalt thou rise,More dreadful, from each foreign strokeMore dreadful, dreadful from each foreign stroke;As the loud blast, the blast that tears the skies,Serves but to root thy native oak. ""Rule Britannia! Britannia rule the waves:""Britons never, never, never will be slaves."" Thee haughty tyrants ne'er shall tame:All their attempts to bend thee down,All their attempts to bend thee downWill but arouse, arouse thy generous flame;But work their woe, and thy renown. ""Rule Britannia! Britannia rule the waves:""Britons never, never, never will be slaves."" To thee belongs the rural reign;Thy cities shall with commerce shineThy cities shall with commerce shine:All thine shall be the subject main,And every shore it circles thine. ""Rule Britannia! Britannia rule the waves:""Britons never, never, never will be slaves."" The Muses, still with freedom found,Shall to thy happy coast repairShall to thy happy coast repair;Oh blest Isle! With matchless beauty crown'd,And manly hearts to guard the fair. ""Rule Britannia! Britannia rule the waves:""Britons never, never, never will be slaves."""
589,589,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson says ‘UK’s getting back on its feet’ and hails huge number of Brits returning to work and school,"BRITAIN is getting back on its feet, Boris Johnson declared last night. The Prime Minister hailed the huge numbers of Brits returning to work and school. As millions of children headed for classrooms, an enthusiastic Mr Johnson thanked teachers, pupils and parents in playing their part for this ""incredible country"". And he vowed to do absolutely everything in his power to help get more workers back to their desks, insisting there would be no extension to the furlough scheme. Although warning there would be ""more wretched Covid to come"", Mr Johnson said he was ""absolutely confident"" Britain was on the road to recovery despite worrying images of empty commuter trains amid a sluggish return to towns and cities. Downing Street was unable to supply data on how many were back at work but more than 40 per cent of schools were finally reopened yesterday. And the Cabinet was back in Westminster for their first meeting since the summer break. The PM addressed a gathering of his top team around a socially distanced Cabinet table in the Foreign Office building. He said: ""This is the first day back for us but across the country hundreds and thousands, millions of pupils are going back to school thanks to the huge efforts their teachers, their parents have made over the last few days and weeks. ""People are going back to the office in huge numbers across our country and quite right, too. ""Bit by bit, this incredible country is getting back on its feet and recovering from this crisis. ""We, in this Government, are committed to trying to do everything in our power to help. That's what we have been doing over the last few months, and that's what we're going to continue to do."" But Mr Johnson warned: ""Of course, we know that there is still going to be more of this disease, this wretched Covid, still to come. ""We know there will be more outbreaks — and we are absolutely confident that we are going to be able to deal with those outbreaks."" After a torrid summer of U-turns, he used the first meeting to try to justify the chaos over free school meals, exam results and masks in schools. He told his ministers: ""In the last few months, we've been sailing into the teeth of a gale, no question. ""I am no great nautical expert but sometimes it is necessary to tack here and there in response to the facts as they change, in response to the wind's change. ""But we have been going steadily in the direction, in the course we set out, and we have not been blown off that course."" Yet, he insisted there would be no U-turn over the end of the furlough scheme which begins to wind down this month, despite pressure from MPs to extend it. The Job Retention Scheme set up in March paid furloughed workers 80 per cent of their wages from the public purse. That drops to 70 per cent this month and then 60 per cent in October before its planned conclusion on November 1. Labour and some senior Conservatives are calling for an extension to the scheme. Former Tory Cabinet Minister Stephen Crabb told HuffPost UK: ""There are still many firms in different sectors that simply cannot operate in the current scenario. ""There is a real danger that the unwinding of furlough will lead to the loss of thousands more high-value jobs ""Germany, which knows all about retaining domestic industrial strength, has just decided to continue its furlough scheme for another 12 months."" But last night the Treasury firmly slapped down the calls to extend the scheme. And Chancellor Rishi Sunak's firm stance was backed by Mr Johnson who said: ""We have been clear that we cannot sustain the situation indefinitely. There isn't any change to the position."" His official spokesman added: ""By the time the furlough scheme ends, we will have paid wages for eight months saving 9.6 million jobs."" The Treasury said: ""The end of the furlough scheme is not the end of our support for jobs. For businesses that can successfully bring furloughed employees back to work, this includes a £1,000 job retention bonus."" But the Institute for Public Policy Research think tank said ending the arrangement too quickly would be ""an historic mistake"". It added: ""Reforming and extending the scheme now could prevent jobs losses and boost the economy in this time of need."" The Treasury will today launch a £2billion Kickstart scheme to help the young unemployed into work. Employers can offer those aged 16 to 24 a six-month work placement even if they are claiming Universal Credit. By Matt Dathan, Deputy Political Editor GAVIN Williamson has insisted next summer's GCSE and A-level exams will go ahead as normal - but didn't rule out a short delay. The under-fire Education Secretary also said he was ""deeply sorry"" to school pupils who had their grades unfairly downgraded last month. He told MPs in the Commons: ""We are determined that exams and assessments will go ahead next year, and we're working with the sector to ensure that this is done as smoothly as possible. ""While none of this disruption is what we wanted for our students, I believe that they now have a certainty and reassurance they deserve and will be able to embark on the next exciting phase of their lives."" Mr Williamson hailed the reopening of schools as a ""massive milestone"" and told MPs he was ""confident"" the necessary precautions are in place for all school pupils to return this term. The Treasury will pick up the wages, taxes and pension contributions in the hope it will help to create new full-time jobs. Unveiling the plans, Mr Sunak insisted: ""This is not just about kickstarting our country's economy, it is an opportunity to kickstart the careers of thousands of our young people who could otherwise be left behind as a result of the pandemic. ""The scheme will open the door to a brighter future for a new generation and it will ensure that the UK bounces back stronger as a country."""
590,590,The Sun,Harry Cole,Chancellor set to axe foreign aid to help foot UK’s Covid-19 bill in November Budget,"FOREIGN aid is set to be axed to help foot the UK's Covid-19 bill. Britain has a legal commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of its GDP on foreign projects. But Chancellor Rishi Sunak has indicated that the amount — up to £15billion a year — could be sacrificed to help plug the budget black hole caused by coronavirus. Instead, some money could be used to fund Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence projects, and invested in the charities sector. Rich countries such as China, led by President Xi Jinping, and India, have benefited from UK taxpayers' cash. Foreign aid has included funding for dementia care in the Chinese province of Qingdao and yoga lessons for Indians at risk of heart failure. Mr Sunak believes he has the backing of the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary for the big move. But they are all aware it will require primary legislation to come into effect, which could take months. Mr Sunak wants to use his November Budget to ""announce the intention"" to scrap it, multiple sources say. But ex-deputy PM Damian Green said the idea made him ""wince"". The commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of GDP on foreign giveaways was a flagship policy of ex-PM David Cameron. It is loathed by many senior Tories who resented foreign aid growing even amid spending cuts at home. News of its demise comes as the International Aid department ceases to exist this week after it was swallowed into the Foreign Office. When he unveiled the merger in June, Boris Johnson said the aid budget would no longer be a ""giant cashpoint in the sky"" for countries like India and China."
591,591,The Sun,Harry Cole,Price of burgers to plummet by a THIRD under new trade deal with New Zealand,"FAMILIES will get a cut-price burger treat under a new trade deal with New Zealand. They will see the price of high-end wagyu beef fall by a third if agreement is reached. That would drive down the cost of two wagyu burgers by £1.50 to just £3 in supermarkets. Kiwi farmer Jason Ross said: ""Our wagyu is the Rolls-Royce of beef. We would love to make it more widely available."" Imports from New Zealand are currently hit with a 20 per cent import tax set by the EU — and that could end after Brexit. But farming unions and some ministers want to keep tariffs high to try to prop up the UK market. Now, leading farmer Denis Lynn has urged Trade Secretary Liz Truss to stare down the protectionists. Mr Lynn is boss of Northern Irish meat company Finnebrogue, which farms scores of wagyu cows — but has to import the upmarket beef because he cannot keep up with demand. He wrote to her: ""I am not worried about the competition. The brilliant British beef industry will continue to thrive. ""As an importer of wagyu, I commit to passing on every penny saved from tariff-free trade to the consumer."" Brexit-backing former Tory Minister Steve Baker said: ""A zero-tariff and zero-quota free trade agreement with our Kiwi cousins can provide a brilliant boost for British consumers. ""Leaving the European Union is an opportunity to cut the cost of our food and improve its quality at the same time."" Trade talks with New Zealand will continue through the autumn."
592,592,The Sun,Kate FergusonHarry Cole,Shamed Ofqual boss Sally Collier quits with £1MILLION pension despite disastrous time in the job,"SHAMED ex Ofqual boss Sally Collier will walk away with a gold-plated £1million pension from her disastrous time in the job. The bungling bureaucrat will pocket an eye-watering amount despite being forced to quit over the A Levels fiasco. Furious Tory MPs slammed the ""reward for failure"" and said parents and pupils will be seething over the payment. Ofqual accounts show that Ms Collier has amassed a £926,000 nest egg from her time as a Whitehall mandarin. She spent four years as boss of Ofqual, which oversaw the botched computer algorithm which unfairly downgraded some 40 per cent of A Level grades. After days of growing fury, Ms Collier quit her post. But The Sun revealed earlier this week that she could still keep a plum job at the Cabinet Office despite the fiasco. Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith blasted the cash. He told The Sun: ""It is astonishing by anyone's standards. ""As a mandarin she is not very accountable – but she has left with a fat account book. ""Parents and A Level students whose summers were wrecked by the scandal will be up in arms. ""She will get this fat cheque and just walk straight into another well paying job in the civil service. It is a reward for failure."" Tory MP Robert Halfon, chairman of the education select committee, said: ""No doubt the National Audit Office will be examining whether this represents value for money for hard pressed taxpayers."" Ofqual has been placed in special measures and bosses from the schools watchdog Ofsted brought in to help run it in the wake of the exams disaster. The Sun has contacted Ofqual for comment."
593,593,The Sun,Harry Cole,Home Office deportation flight for Channel migrants abandoned amid legal ‘quagmire’,"A HOME Office flight bound for Spain to return illegal Channel migrants had to be abandoned on Thursday morning after being bogged down in legal action, The Sun can reveal. 23 illegal migrants who had arrived on small boats were due to be deported but were successfully removed from the flight on legal technicalities. Home Secretary Priti Patel is understood to be ""furious"" at the latest attempt to stop Britain clamping down on dangerous migrant crossings in the English Channel. A Whitehall source said ""there was 100 per cent legal attrition rate on the flight due to unprecedented and organised casework barriers sprung on the government by three law firms."" The Sun has learnt that all 23 were represented by Duncan Lewis, John Street or Milestone solicitors and all were classed as a risk to themselves or others in detention. The Madrid authorities had agreed to take back 20 migrants who had passed through Spain on their attempted journey to Britain. But they were able to hire lawyers to ""bog the process down in legal quagmire"", according to the Whitehall insider. Officials will attempt the flight again in two weeks time. A Home Office Spokesperson said: ""The Government's efforts to facilitate entirely legitimate and legal returns of people who have entered the U. K. through illegal routes are too often frustrated by last minute challenges submitted hours before a scheduled flight. ""These claims are very often baseless and entirely without merit, but are given full legal consideration, leading to removal being rescheduled. This can effectively result in the timing out of a return due to stringent Dublin Regulations."" A source added: ""Due to a high volume of last-minute legal challenges which needed time for consideration, today's flight was paused. The UK only ever returns those who the Home Office and, where applicable, the courts are satisfied do not need our protection and have no legal basis to remain in the UK."""
594,594,The Sun,Harry Cole,Matt Hancock opens Cabinet rift by saying he doesn’t care if his officials work from home,"MATT Hancock opened a Cabinet rift today after saying he didn't care that his civil servants are working home - despite desperate pleas from Boris Johnson for Whitehall officials to return to their desks. The Health Secretary said he was concerned how his civil servants ""perform"" in their jobs rather than whether or not they return to the office - in direct contradiction to the PM's orders. Cabinet ministers have been infuriated by the ""ghost ship"" departments that they wanted to fill to set an example to the rest of Britain that it's time to go back to work. In July Whitehall bosses were ordered to  'change the default that civil servants should work from home, and accelerate the return to the workplace from August 1'. But amid claims only one in 20 are back in Westminster, Downing Street has consistently refused to publish how many civil servants are back at work. Mr Hancock claimed he had ""absolutely no idea"" how many of his officials were at their desks. Downing Street declined to comment on Mr Hancock's words, but a No 10 source said: ""The PM has made his views about this very clear and has said a lot on the subject."" The slap down came after CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn urged the Government to lead firms in getting staff back to the workplace. Ms Fairbairn warned that commercial centres risk becoming permanent ""ghost towns"" and said that returning employees to offices is as important as getting pupils back to schools. In an interview on Times Radio, Mr Hancock was asked if he knew what percentage of staff in the Department for Health were working at home. ""I have absolutely no idea,"" he responded. ""What I care about is how effectively people work and obviously people should come back to the office if that is what they need to do their job. ""And also employers need to make sure the offices are Covid-secure, as we have obviously in the Department for Health, as you would fully expect us to."" He stressed: ""But what I care about is that people perform and so the people I work with, some of them have been working from home, some come in sometimes, some are full-time, and what matters to me is that they deliver and, frankly, they've been delivering at an unbelievable rate. ""I mean, you know, there's sometimes this caricature that people who work in the Civil Service work a 9 to 5 day, it's just completely untrue in my experience. ""And people are working incredibly hard because, ultimately, it's a mission-driven job and, in the middle of a pandemic, the whole department has stepped up to that mission."" The Health Secretary also said that getting staff back to work is a matter for employers. Mr Hancock said: ""I think that this has got to be done across the board. If you think about the nation as a whole, it's got to be done in a Covid-secure way. ""But employers are doing that and the rules are clear about that."" Just last week No10 urged employees to speak to their employers about how to get back safely."
595,595,The Sun,Harry Cole,Ex-Cabinet Minister says UK-US relations can’t continue as normal until Harry Dunn’s family get justice,"ONE year on ""business as usual"" can not continue between Britain and America until Harry Dunn's family get justice, a former Cabinet Minister warns today. On the anniversary of the teenage motorcyclist's death today, Andrea Leadsom tells The Sun: ""What has happened is quite simple yet utterly unacceptable."" Harry was riding his motorbike last summer when he collided with US citizen Anne Sacoolas who was driving on the wrong side of the road. Washington has refused to extradite the former CIA spy who fled in the aftermath of last year's fatal crash outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire. Sacoolas has been charged with dangerous driving - but claimed diplomatic immunity and absconded to the United States. Mrs Leadsom says today: ""The UK's greatest ally continues to deny justice to Harry - a 19 year old young man with all his life ahead of him."" Harry's mother Charlotte Charles said the decision not to send Sacoolas back to the UK  ""is doing us real harm and I can't believe how cruel the US government are being."" Today Ms Leadsom, who is the family's local MP, ramps up the pressure on the Attorney General to try Sacoolas virtually in the UK. She said: ""It is clear that Anne Sacoolas must face the responsibility of her actions – as anyone would expect to in these difficult circumstances. It will bring reassurance for Harry's family, friends and the local community. For closure and healing, justice must take place."" She added: ""Harry's family have never sought revenge, but they believe strongly in right and wrong, and in being accountable for your actions. ""They have agreed that  a 'virtual' trial, whereby Ms Sacoolas faces a UK jury whilst remaining on US soil, would give them the closure that they seek, and so with their agreement, I have written to Ministers and the CPS to ask for support for this clear way forward."" Robert Buckland the Justice Secretary confirmed this week that the Government is considering the plan. By Andrea Leadsom, South Northamptonshire MP TODAY marks one year since the terrible crash that caused the death of Harry Dunn outside RAF Croughton. We all know the tragic events of that day and the immense pain and loss that Harry's family and friends continue to live with. Harry's family should have received the justice they rightly deserve, but a year on, that is still not the case. As the local MP I have tried to support Harry's parents, Tim and Charlotte, and their family since they first came to seek my help last year. Together we have pressed the Foreign Secretary, Home Secretary, Transport Secretary, Health Secretary, Attorney General, Police and Crime Commissioner for Northamptonshire, Northamptonshire Police, the CPS and the US Embassy to deliver justice for Harry, as well as to make changes to diplomatic agreements and local improvements that will minimise the risk of a tragedy like this ever being repeated. I have made the case in the House of Commons that any idea of base expansion at RAF Croughton would be inappropriate while Harry's family continue to be denied justice by the US Government. I have asked for a recent planning application at the base to be called in under the Secretary of State's power to consider plans that have a 'national interest' angle. The refusal of the US Government to allow justice for Harry puts any 'business as usual' cooperation with planning at RAF Croughton firmly in this category. What has happened is quite simple yet utterly unacceptable - Anne Sacoolas claimed diplomatic immunity and returned to America. The Crown Prosecution Service charged her in her absence. Priti Patel, our Home Secretary, requested her extradition and the US Government refused. The Foreign Secretary recently fixed the 'anomaly' that allowed Sacoolas to claim diplomatic immunity, and this waiver is now expressly extended to all dependents of US staff at RAF Croughton.  It permits the automatic waiver of diplomatic immunity should another tragic incident occur in the future. So it's clear the US Government accept the principle that walking away from the consequences of your actions is wrong.  Yet the UK's greatest ally continues to deny justice to Harry - a 19 year old young man with all his life ahead of him. Harry's family have never sought revenge.  But they believe strongly in right and wrong, and in being accountable for your actions.  They have agreed that  a 'virtual' trial, whereby Ms Sacoolas faces a UK jury whilst remaining on US soil, would give them the closure that they seek, and so with their agreement, I have written to Ministers and the CPS to ask for support for this clear way forward. This approach would allow the US to continue to deny extradition and to refuse the waiver of diplomatic immunity.  If sentenced, Ms Sacoolas could carry out her term in the US. It is clear that Anne Sacoolas must face the responsibility of her actions – as anyone would expect to in these difficult circumstances. It will bring reassurance for Harry's family, friends and the local community. I will continue to push the Government for a virtual trial. For closure and healing, justice must take place."
596,596,The Sun,Harry ColeSascha O'Sullivan,"Ex-BBC chairman blasts ‘idiotic, out of touch’ corporation over BBC proms row","THE former boss of the BBC has savaged their ""idiotic""  decision to censor Last Night of the Proms branding their journalists ""out of touch"" on Brexit and Boris. Former BBC chairman Michael Grade lashed out in astonishing on air rant warning the BBC is ""too trapped in the Westminster bubble"" and has called everything wrong from the referendum to last year's election. Beeb bosses have been heavily criticised over the ""woke"" decision to ban the words to Rule, Brittania! and Land of Hope and Glory from the Last Night of the Proms over the songs' links to slavery and colonialism. Lord Grade told the Today programme that the BBC had prove ""they are out of touch with the rest of the country, they have shown that time and again with Brexit coverage."" ""They missed the big swing at the election and they are too trapped in the Westminster Bubble"", he added. ""The big question is what is the future for public sector broadcasting? And he urged BBC bosses to have a ""long hard look and come up with a role for the BBC... which hasn't changed in 100 years."" And on the proms row he added it's ""clearly a mistake, it's just idiotic."" Boris Johnson entered the fray over Proms yesterday by blasting the ""cringing embarrassment"" over Britain's history. He said yesterday: ""I think it's time we stopped our cringing embarrassment about our history, about our traditions, and about our culture, and we stopped this general fight of self-recrimination and wetness, I wanted to get that off my chest."" THE BBC no longer seeks to represent or entertain half the population. Why should we all still be forced to fund it? It is clear from its news, its commentary, its dramas and its dismal, lazy comedy that it despises the voting majority which — to the out-of-touch corporation's disbelief — repeatedly backed both Brexit and the Tories. Its decision now to censor Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory ought to be the last straw. Boris Johnson has rightly joined many others in condemning it. And though it is not for the PM to decide the BBC's output, his Government can and should end its publicly funded financial model. The Beeb could turn this around. It just doesn't want to. It dislikes much about Britain and is ashamed of our past. Its woke staff are interested only in causes and ideas beloved of middle-class metropolitan Remainer graduates like them. Mainstream views shared by the ordinary majority, older Conservative voters in particular, are held in contempt if they are considered at all. So Tories, who won a huge election mandate only months ago, are treated with cynical disdain. Meanwhile left-wing activists are routinely given platforms on news programmes where they masquerade as ""ordinary people"" or even Newsnight journalists. The BBC has destroyed the case for its licence fee. It's time the Government stopped griping about it and took action. But the BBC said the songs would be sung next year - and said the decision to cut the lyrics was over fears of a second wave of coronavirus. A spokesman for the BBC said: ""For the avoidance of any doubt, these songs will be sung next year. ""We obviously share the disappointment of everyone that the Proms will have to be different but believe this is the best solution in the circumstances and look forward to their traditional return next year."" Outgoing director-general of the BBC, Lord Tony Hall, has said the decision to remove the lyrics was a ""creative"" one, but said the issue of the songs' association with colonial history had been discussed. He said  said it was a ""miracle"" that Proms boss David Pickard had put together a fortnight of live performances amid the pandemic. When asked if the songs' links to colonial history had been discussed, Lord Hall said: ""The whole thing has been discussed by David and his colleagues, of course it has. ""The point is they've come to the right conclusion, which is it's very, very hard in an Albert Hall that takes over 5,000 people to have the atmosphere of the Last Night Of The Proms, where a whole audience normally sing along,"" he told the BBC's media editor. ""It's quite hard creatively and artistically to make that work. I think they've come to the right conclusion."""
597,597,The Sun,Harry Cole,Aussie gov backs Boris over ex-PM Tony Abbott’s trade job – but uproar in UK,"A FURIOUS international row has broken out over The Sun's revelation Boris Johnson is to hire the ex-Australian PM Tony Abbott to join the UK's Board of Trade. The ancient body is being relaunched by ministers to drum up business for post Brexit-Britain and the PM is good friends with the former Aussie premier. Current Aussie PM Scott Morrison called it a ""good hire"" but back home there was uproar over Mr Abbott's right-wing track record. Asked about The Sun's report today that Mr Abbott is to head up the trade group, Mr Morrison said: ""well done Boris, good hire."" And under strict laws down under to counter espionage, he was asked if Mr Abbott would have to declare himself a foreign agent. ""If there's paperwork for Tony to fill out, I'm sure he'll get that done"", he told reporters. But Aussie Labor mocked the appointment as ""good for onion growers"" - in a reference to an astonishing 2015 incident where Mr Abbott ate a raw onion with the skin on like an apple. Their trade spokesman Madeleine King hit out: ""Is Tony Abbott, as a former prime minister, going to work for the UK government to promote the interests of British exporters over Australians? That's a question that needs to be answered."" And there was a row over why Mr Abbott was able to fly to London to meet with Trade Secretary Liz Truss to discuss the job yesterday despite Coronavirus flight restrictions Aussie Labor asked why the ex-PM was ""allowed to leave for a breakfast meeting about a plum job with a foreign government."" They added: ""With Scott Morrison it's clearly one rule for the privileged few while other Australians can't get exemptions to visit dying relatives."" In the UK, Shadow Trade Secretary Emily Thornberry branded it a ""staggering appointment"" due to Mr Abbott's controversies over the environment, women and immigration. She blasted: ""On a personal level, it is shameful that Boris Johnson thinks this offensive, aggressive, leering, gaffe-prone misogynist is the right person to represent our country overseas."" ""And on a professional level, this is someone with no hands-on experience of negotiating trade agreements, who denies the climate change that we believe should be at the heart of our trade policy, and who clearly has no concept of the importance of Britain's trade with the EU. She went on: ""He was ousted by his own colleagues after just two years in power, and rejected by his own constituents just last year. They are the people who know him best, and wanted rid of him, yet here we are now, hiring him to negotiate our trade deals around the world. ""It's yet more breathtaking incompetence from a government that has turned it into an art-form."" But Nigel Farage defended Mr Abbott, saying he ""is a talented and deeply principled man with a great commitment to Brexit. This is a good appointment. Mr Abbott did not comment when asked by multiple Aussie news outlets."
598,598,The Sun,Simon BoyleHarry ColeMike RidleyEmma James,BBC bosses attacked for failing to intervene and allowing ‘woke’ Proms conductor to ban lyrics,"A CHORUS of anger on Tuesday met the BBC's decision to ban the words to Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory from the Last Night of the Proms. Beeb bosses were attacked for failing to intervene and allowing woke Finnish Proms conductor Dalia Stasevska to ditch the words and play only musical arrangements. Outgoing Director General Tony Hall and BBC One Director of Content Charlotte Moore were among those in the line of fire. Boris Johnson railed against the corporation, while war veterans condemned the ban. And the daughter of forces' sweetheart Dame Vera Lynn — who died earlier this year aged 103 — hit out, too. A petition calling for the lyrics to be reinstated gained tens of thousands of signatures amid calls to defund the BBC. On Tuesday night, Dame Vera versions of Land of Hope and Glory hit No1 and No2 in the iTunes chart after anti-woke campaigners urged Brits to download the crowd-pleaser in protest. Her daughter, Virginia Lewis-Jones, 74, said: ""My mother started singing Land of Hope and Glory on VE Day in 1945. ""It's a song that was so important to her and the war generation. ""For millions of people Land of Hope personifies what it means to be British and to live here. Even now it resonates, perhaps even more so today."" Beeb bosses announced that the anthems would feature only as orchestral versions amid fears of a backlash from Black Lives Matter campaigners over their lyrics' British Empire connotations. Virginia added: ""Anything to do with slavery is appalling and I can appreciate the sentiment but, on the other hand, had the Nazis won in World War Two people in Britain would have been slaves. ""And if you weren't blond with blue eyes you probably wouldn't be here anyway, not to put too fine a point on it."" National treasure Dame Vera shot back into the charts after actor Laurence Fox asked his 230,000 Twitter followers on Tuesday to try to get the song to No1. He added: ""Would the @BBC then have to play it? What a beautiful day that would be. Please share widely. RT #DefundTheBBC."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""I think it's time we stopped our cringing embarrassment about our history, about our traditions, and about our culture, and we stopped this general bout of self-recrimination and wetness."" And on social media, Foreign Office minister James Cleverly wrote: 'I'm black. My mum was black. I have black family. I have black friends. I have black colleagues. I have black constituents. ""Number of times that the Last Night of the Proms was raised with me as an issue before this BBC nonsense? Zero."" THE BBC no longer seeks to represent or entertain half the population. Why should we all still be forced to fund it? It is clear from its news, its commentary, its dramas and its dismal, lazy comedy that it despises the voting majority which — to the out-of-touch corporation's disbelief — repeatedly backed both Brexit and the Tories. Its decision now to censor Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory ought to be the last straw. Boris Johnson has rightly joined many others in condemning it. And though it is not for the PM to decide the BBC's output, his Government can and should end its publicly funded financial model. The Beeb could turn this around. It just doesn't want to. It dislikes much about Britain and is ashamed of our past. Its woke staff are interested only in causes and ideas beloved of middle-class metropolitan Remainer graduates like them. Mainstream views shared by the ordinary majority, older Conservative voters in particular, are held in contempt if they are considered at all. So Tories, who won a huge election mandate only months ago, are treated with cynical disdain. Meanwhile left-wing activists are routinely given platforms on news programmes where they masquerade as ""ordinary people"" or even Newsnight journalists. The BBC has destroyed the case for its licence fee. It's time the Government stopped griping about it and took action. Constance Halford-Thompson, 93, who served in the Women's Auxiliary Service in Burma, said: ""It's absolute rubbish not to sing the words."" Constance, of Putney, South West London, added: ""It's part of our history and part of England."" Ex-RAF man Alan McQuillan, 97, of Cirencester, Gloucs, said: ""Not singing it is a daft idea. If there was an audience there I suspect they'd sing it anyway."" Ex-Paratrooper Fred Duffield, 94, of Leek, Staffs, said: ""It's political correctness gone mad not to sing it."" A BBC spokeswoman would only say the call was ""ultimately a BBC decision"". But the highly paid executives refused to take responsibility and put the blame on guest conductor Ms Stasevska. The traditional anthems are usually played as the Last Night audience enthusiastically waves flags and sings along. But there will be no audience at London's Royal Albert Hall on September 12 for the concert owing to coronavirus. On Tuesday night, panicked BBC chiefs insisted the songs would be sung next year — but refused to reinstate them this time. A host of managers and board members are in the chain of command responsible for the Proms, whose director is David Pickard. Big guns also include Alan Davey, James Purnell and the outgoing BBC Director General Mr Hall, who was last night being urged to reverse the decision by furious lobbyists. Asked whether BBC chiefs had discussed plans to ditch the songs over links to slavery, Mr Hall said: 'The whole thing has been discussed by David and his colleagues; of course, it has."""
599,599,The Sun,Harry Cole,Defence Secretary slams Labour calls to pause legislation to protect veterans from prosecution,"THE Defence Secretary has slammed Labour calls for a pause to legislation designed to protect our boys from prosecution. Ben Wallace branded it a ""slap in the face to veterans"" after his opposition shadow said new measures to protect troops breached human rights laws. The planned Overseas Operations Bill due before MPs next month enshrines a ""statutory presumption against prosecution"" after five years to all forces, including those who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. It has been drawn up to protect troops from vexatious complaints drummed up by tank chasing lawyers. But Labour's John Healey said: ""This clearly creates the risk that serious violations could go unpunished if an incident does not come to light for five years or if investigations are drawn out beyond that deadline."" But Mr Wallace told The Sun: ""Labour's new found facade of supporting our armed forces has been exposed for what it is - fake."" He added: ""Pausing the bill is a slap in the face to veterans who have gone through the turmoil of dealing with vexatious claims."" An MOD spokesperson said: ""This vital piece of legislation will protect military personnel and veterans from vexatious claims and the cycle of re-investigation into alleged offences. ""Pausing this bill will continue to leave our soldiers vulnerable to vexatious persecution. ""The way to demonstrate support for our armed forces is to make progress with this important legislation."""

The PM waded into the ongoing row after the BBC announced it wouldn't show the singing of Last Night of the Proms over fears over its links to the British Empire. Mr Johnson said on a business visit this lunchtime: ""I think it's time we stopped our cringing embarrassment about our history, about our traditions, and about our culture, and we stopped this general fight of self-recrimination and wetness, I wanted to get that off my chest."" It comes as: Beeb bosses instead announced they would feature — but only as orchestral versions amid fears of a backlash from Black Lives Matter campaigners due to lyrical connotations about the British Empire. Business secretary Alok Sharma told Times Radio that he thought the BBC could put subtitles on the screen for Last Night of the Proms so people could sing along at home. And Mr Fox said the decision came from a ""Britain-hating"" BBC, calling for it to be stripped of its license fee funding. He tweeted: ""Defund this shameful, Britain-hating organisation and start again. The lunatics are in charge of the asylum #Defund the BBC."" His comments were echoed by Piers Morgan, who called the decision ""absolutely pathetic"". Piers wrote on Twitter: ""The BBC needs to grow a pair & stop grovelling to such insane 'woke' cancel culture nonsense that most Britons find utterly absurd."" Over 10,000 Brits have now called for the lyrics to be reinstated, signing a petition which hopes to reach 15,000 signatures. The annual Royal Albert Hall concert, beamed around the world, traditionally ends with the flag-waving anthems. But organisers were said to be concerned about their links to the British Empire, and lyrics including: ""Britons never will be slaves."" One BBC source described the handling of the line-up as ""white guys in a panic,"" trying to appease the movement. The Government had expressed its displeasure with the move. Culture Sec Oliver Dowden told the BBC that ""confident, forward-looking nations don't erase their history"". Former Cabinet Minister Andrea Leadsom tweeted: ""Seriously? Has the Beeb totally lost touch?"" Tory MP David Morris said: ""We cannot erase our history. We have got to be proud to be British. It does not matter what colour, creed or religion you are."" It came as leader Sir Keir Starmer weighed into the row defending the ""pomp and pageantry"" as ""a staple of British summer."" Asked if he backed the move to censor the words to Rule Britannia, a Labour spokesman said ""enjoying patriotic songs does not - and should not - present a barrier to examining our past and learning lessons from it."" But they stopped short if demanding a uturn, insisting the running order was a matter for the organisers. The spokesperson said: ""The running order is a matter for organisers & the BBC, but enjoying patriotic songs does not... present a barrier to examining our past."" Labour's Lord Adonis said today: ""It's part of being English, I don't understand what the problem is. ""It seems almost laughable to think we are going to start censoring some of these great national songs. ""What are they going to next, the national anthem? It's ridiculous this whole thing."" Labour's catastrophic election defeat last year was partly down to the party's 'patriotism problem'. Party insiders said furious voters repeatedly raised the issue on the doorstep. Sir Keir Starmer had promised to change all that and called for the party to finally embrace patriotism. Speaking in April this year, he said: ""I'm really proud of my country and I wouldn't be leader of the Labour party if I wasn't patriotic. ""What I desperately want for our country is for our country to get better. In the Labour party we should be proud of being patriotic. ""We're all working, knocking on doors in the rain or shine, to try to put in place a team that can go into government to improve the country we live in because we love the country we live in. ""I don't think we should shy away from that. That is a really good thing to be proud of, and to want your country to be the best it possibly can be.""

But Kehinde Andrews, a black studies professor at Birmingham City University, said the line ""Britons never, never, never shall be slaves"" from Rule Britannia is racist propaganda dating back to the British Empire. Rule, Britannia! Britannia, rule the waves! Britons never, never, never shall be slaves. When Britain first, at heaven's command, Arose from out the azure main, This was the charter of the land, And Guardian Angels sang this strain: The nations not so blest as thee Must, in their turn, to tyrants fall, While thou shalt flourish great and free: The dread and envy of them all. Still more majestic shalt thou rise, More dreadful from each foreign stroke, As the loud blast that tears the skies Serves but to root thy native oak. Thee haughty tyrants ne'er shall tame; All their attempts to bend thee down Will but arouse thy generous flame, But work their woe and thy renown. To thee belongs the rural reign; Thy cities shall with commerce shine; All thine shall be the subject main, And every shore it circles, thine. The Muses, still with freedom found, Shall to thy happy coasts repair. Blest isle! with matchless beauty crowned, And manly hearts to guard the fair. Rule, Britannia! Britannia, rule the waves!

601,601,The Sun,Harry ColeSimon Boyle,Rule Britannia ban: Laurence Fox urges BBC viewers to cancel licence fee after lyrics ditched from Proms songs,"LAURENCE Fox today urged BBC viewers to cancel their licence fees after the Beeb ditched lyrics from two Last Night of the Proms songs. BBC luvvies sparked uproar on Monday by saying they would scrap the words from Land of Hope and Glory and Rule, Britannia! at the annual event. Bosses said the songs would instead feature as orchestral versions amid fears of a backlash from Black Lives Matter campaigners due to lyrical connotations about the British Empire.

He tweeted: ""Defund this shameful, Britain-hating organisation and start again. The lunatics are in charge of the asylum #Defund the BBC.""

""They are in breach of their contract with the British people #DefundTheBBC."" Lord Digby Jones added: ""So the BBC is considering dropping Rule Britannia & Land of Hope & Glory from the Last Night of the Proms. Is there no end to their wokeness? ""How about the enjoyment of the millions of Brits who pay the licence fee? You can't choose history on your terms. It doesn't belong to you."" It came as a BBC source described the handling of the Proms line-up as ""white guys in a panic,"" trying to appease the Black Lives Matter movement. Meanwhile Boris Johnson slammed the ""woke"" plans to axe the patriotic sing-along climax from next month's bash. Debating the issue on Good Morning Britain, freedom of speech campaigner Inaya Folarin Iman said criticism of the two songs was ""absurd"", adding that they bring ""a lot of people joy and happiness"". But Kehinde Andrews, a black studies professor at Birmingham City University, said the line ""Britons never, never, never shall be slaves"" from Rule Britannia is racist propaganda dating back to the British Empire. Organisers said they were concerned about the lyrics along with their links. TV choirmaster Gareth Malone, told The Times that he supported removing Rule Britannia lyrics in solidarity with black and Irish members of his choirs who had refused to sing it in previous years. He said: ""If people want to sing about the subjugation and enslavement of other nations, I don't think that should be given a platform in 2020."" His view was shared by Chi-Chi Nwanoku, founder of the Chineke! Foundation, which supports ethnic minority musicians. She told The Guardian: ""The lyrics are just so offensive."" The annual Royal Albert Hall concert, beamed around the world, traditionally ends with the flag-waving anthems. At the weekend, it was reported that the conductor for this year's Last Night, Dalia Stasevska of Finland, was keen to reduce the patriotic elements of the event. It led to a backlash yesterday, with the Prime Minister and Oliver Dowden, the Culture Secretary, getting involved. Mr Dowden told the BBC that ""confident, forward-looking nations don't erase their history"". And Boris Johnson said that while he understands the emotions involved, ""we need to tackle the substance of problems, not the symbols"". Former Cabinet Minister Andrea Leadsom tweeted: ""Seriously? Has the Beeb totally lost touch?"" Tory MP David Morris said: ""We cannot erase our history. We have got to be proud to be British. It does not matter what colour, creed or religion you are."" Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage told The Sun: ""The BBC should stop apologising for our history and our heritage. People will be disgusted by this level of political correctness. The only thing that needs cancelling is the BBC itself."" And North West Durham MP Richard Holden wrote: ""Another stupid move from the BBC. Just let the people sing! At every turn the BBC just dig the hole they're in a bit deeper. They need to stop with this attempt to appease the woke morons."" In a bid to defuse the row, BBC bosses announced last night that the Last Night on September 12 would still feature ""familiar, patriotic elements"". It said: ""With much reduced musical forces and no live audience, the Proms will curate a concert that includes familiar, patriotic elements such as Jerusalem and the National Anthem, and bring in new moments capturing the mood of this unique time [...]."" It added that the programme will include ""new orchestral versions of Pomp and Circumstance March No 1 'Land of Hope and Glory' (arr. Anne Dudley) and Rule Britannia"".

SAGE member and former Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Mark Walport has praised ministers for sticking to the plan which has seen infection rates slump. He told Times Radio: ""A bad flu epidemic combined with coronavirus could put enormous pressure on the NHS. ""The relatively good news, I think, is that in the southern hemisphere their winter flu wasn't too bad. ""It may be that social distancing reduced the flu as well. ""But were we to abandon social distancing, it is absolutely clear we would get a second major wave of the infection."" Sir Walport also praised Ministers contingency planning revealed by the Sun.

603,603,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Young terrorists who murder can get shorter jail sentence than those caught just plotting an attack,"YOUNG terrorists who murder can get a shorter sentence than those caught just plotting an atrocity. Ministers are being urged to close the legal loophole that means 18 to 21-year-olds planning bombings can receive longer sentences than if attacks succeed. The bungled guidelines were introduced by Tony Blair's government in 2003. But they have been highlighted by the judge sentencing Manchester bombing accomplice Hashem Abedi. Justice Jeremy Baker noted plotting to cause an explosion ""which merely involves the likelihood of endangering life rather than the fact that death has been caused"" carries a 35-year minimum term for everyone. But he pointed out the ""appropriate starting point"" for an 18-21-year-old committing murder is 30 years. Ultimately, he sentenced Abedi, 23, whose older brother Salman blew himself up in the May 2017 attack, to a minimum term of 55 years for his role in both crimes — directly helping to kill 22 and plotting the atrocity. But because he was under 21 when the massacre took place Justice Baker was constrained from slapping a total life sentence on the jihadi murderer. Dr Alan Mendoza, of the Henry Jackson Society think-tank, said: ""The Government must legislate immediately to change this."" A Justice source said they were ""looking into this""."
604,604,The Sun,Harry Cole,Boris Johnson warns parents that children’s ‘life chances’ are under threat if they don’t go back to school,"BORIS Johnson has issued a fresh plea for parents to send their kids back to school in September — warning that their ""life chances"" are under threat. But, returning to work after his abandoned Scottish camping trip, the PM faced demands from unions for more funding. As the Chief Medical Officer has said, the risk of contracting Covid-19 in school is very small and it is far more damaging for a child's development and their health and well-being to be away from school any longer. (3/4) Personally taking charge of the drive to reopen schools, he leapt on a statement made by the UK's chief medical officers that ""very few, if any"" kids would come to long-term harm from the virus by going to school, while there was a ""certainty"" of harm from not going back to class. In a video posted on Twitter, he said the risk of kids catching the virus is ""very, very, very small"" and the chances of them being very ill are even smaller still. The Prime Minister said: ""It's absolutely vital that pupils get back into school in September. ""It's vital for their education, it's vital for their welfare, it's vital for their physical, and indeed, their mental wellbeing. So let's make sure that all kids, all pupils, get back to school at the beginning of September."" He admitted parents are ""still a bit worried"" but that ""schools are safe"" as teachers have done all they can to make them secure. But Mr Johnson is now facing demands from Britain's biggest trade union for more money for cleaning and to allow teachers to wear masks before they agree to schools returning. Unison warned: ""No one wants to see schools shut down again after a few days because we haven't done enough to put necessary measures in place."" They want members to be allowed to wear masks in the classroom, claiming: ""It's still unclear why government guidance won't allow them when they're recommended for other workplaces."" Unison also wants more cash for school cleaning before they back a return, saying: ""Regular deep cleaning is also key."" Its head of education, Jon Richards, added: ""Schools need more money to pay for specially trained cleaners, rather than relying on other staff who are busy enough already."" A Public Health England report said only 0.01 per cent of pre-schools and primaries in England had a Covid-19 outbreak when pupils returned in June. WHAT must ordinary teachers think about the cynical wrecking actions of their union leaders? Dedicated classroom staff know the UK's chief medical officers are dead right to say kids are more at risk of long-term harm from staying at home than from returning to school. They appreciate more than most how youngsters have been damaged by more than five months without learning, and that the most disadvantaged kids have suffered disproportionately. Their chief concern will be for the education of their pupils. Of course they want to be safe, and they want the children to be safe, but they don't want to wait for impossible guarantees before returning to classrooms where the risk of infection is ""exceptionally small"". That can't be said of the union militants who see the Covid crisis as the perfect excuse to hold the Government to ransom. For them, pupils are just useful political pawns. The latest obstacles to learning come from Unison demanding more money for cleaning and masks for teachers before it will agree to the return to school. Wouldn't they — and flip-flopping Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer — enjoy the Government's discomfort if they turn the start of the new term into another education fiasco? And if children's futures are blighted in the process, so what? That's a risk the militants seem only too happy to take. Reopening was associated with 198 confirmed Covid-19 cases — 70 in kids and 128 in staff. Mr Johnson said on Sunday night: ""As the chief medical officer has said, the risk of contracting Covid-19 in school is very small and it is far more damaging for a child's development to be away any longer. ""This is why it's vitally important that we get our children back. Nothing will have a greater effect on the life chances of our children than returning to school."""
605,605,The Sun,Harry Cole,"Voters across the world believe China and Russia are lying about their coronavirus numbers, poll shows","THERE is a widespread belief around the world that China and Russia are lying about their Covid numbers, a devastating new poll shows. A substantial proportion of voters in the US, UK, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Denmark and Sweden believe China ""are not only misreporting their numbers but doing so on purpose."" The latest YouGov Eurotrack+US survey shows China's behaviour has ""cemented an idea in the minds of people in the West that the country has been ravaged by the disease."" As of August 6th only the Chinese Communist Party claimed 88,000 cases had been recorded in the country, compared to 4.82 million in the US, 2.86 million in Brazil, 1.96 million in India and 307,000 in the UK. But voters were asked to list the four nations they thought had been worst hit by the coronavirus Over the eight countries surveyed, China was ranked between third and sixth overall, in direct contrast to the numbers they have officially declared. People are also highly sceptical about the numbers coming out of Russia, with 46-60% making the same accusation of the Putin regime. Last night YouGov said: ""Part of the reason why so many people think China has been harder hit than the figures suggest is simply because they think China is lying. ""In all eight of the countries we studied a majority of people accused the country of under-reporting coronavirus figures on purpose."" ""People are also highly sceptical about the numbers coming out of Russia, with 46-60% making the same accusation of the Putin regime."" The survey also found that the Spanish are particularly likely to think countries are trying to make their coronavirus situations out to be better than they really are. This includes Spain itself; where 47% of Spaniards believe their own government is lying about how many COVID19 cases and deaths there have been. The French and British are both more likely to accuse their own governments of fixing the figures, but to a much lesser extent than Spain."
606,606,The Sun,Harry ColeTariq Tahir,Jeremy Corbyn gave Meghan Markle and Prince Harry book of left-wing poetry in solidarity during Megxit,"JEREMY Corbyn and his wife gave Harry and Meghan a book of left-wing poetry at the height of the Megxit wars in solidarity with the departing Royals. The Sussexes lavished thanks on the hard-left former Labour leader and his wife for their ""support"" in a bizarre alliance revealed in a new book. Harry and Meghan announced in January that they wanted to step back from their positions as senior royals and become financially independent. The outgoing Labour leader - a life long critic of the Monarchy - met the couple at Westminster Abbey for the annual Commonwealth Day service in March - where Prince Harry was snapped in stony silence not speaking to Prince William. Corbyn's wife Laura Alvarez slipped them a book of verse by the 17th-century Mexican poet Juana Inés de la Cruz, ""a nun whose willingness to attack the hypocrisies of the colonial classes had made her a target for establishment hate."" And according to the new book ""Left Out: The Inside Story of Labour under Corbyn"" the Sussexes sent a personal note of ""great thanks"" to ""Jeremy and Laura"". It read: ""Dear Jeremy and Laura. Sending our great thanks for the wonderful work of Mexican literature that you so kindly gave us at the Commonwealth Service; Sor Juna Ines de la Cruz is a fascinating historical figure, and we look forward to learning more about her life and works! Thanks for the support, Harry and Meghan."" The Commonwealth Day service was one of Harry and Meghan's last outings as members of the Royal Family. But it was marred by friction between them and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. According to Finding Freedom, a new book on Megxit, William, Kate, Charles and Camilla were allowed to walk with the Queen - much to Harry's frustration. This was changed at the last moment so Meghan and Harry entered around the same time as William and Kate. The tension between the royals is revealed in a new book about Megxit, Finding Freedom. The book says: ""While Harry and Meghan greeted William and Kate, the Cambridges showed little response. William nodded, ignoring Meghan."" After January's shock announcement, Harry and  Meghan said they would split their time between the UK and North America, and no longer be known as HRH. Earlier this month, it was revealed that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle had moved from Tyler Perry's £15 home in LA into their new £11m mansion in Santa Barbara with one-year-old son Archie."
607,607,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Leaked document reveals Cabinet’s emergency plans for perfect storm of No Deal Brexit and coronavirus second wave,"EMERGENCY plans have been drawn up to protect the UK from the perfect storm of a winter second wave of Covid-19 coinciding with a No Deal Brexit, a leaked document shows. The warnings, including needing the Navy to protect our fishing fleet from illegal EU boat incursions, pile pressure on ministers to do a deal with Brussels as well as ready the system for a virus spike. The Cabinet Office's EU Transition Task Force gave ministers and officials a horror show Powerpoint presentation marked ""Official Sensitive"" amid concerns not enough is being done to prepare for the worst-case scenario. The leak comes as the latest round of EU trade talks ended with warnings the negotiations are ""going backwards"" and the chances of No Deal in December is rising. If the restrictions on trade sparked by a No Deal scenario were combined with a bad winter of flood, flu and Covid-19, hospitals could be overwhelmed. And parts of Britain may be hit by shortages of power and petrol as 8,500 trucks get stuck at Dover. In Whitehall's ""reasonable worst case scenario"" animal disease might rip through the countryside due to shortages of medicines and the Channel Islands could need military airdrops to avoid running out of food. It warns the Navy might be needed to stop vigilante British fisherman clashing with hundreds of illegal European fishing boat incursions. The Sun has seen the doomsday classified document designed to kickstart ministers into a major planning operation to see off disaster. It reveals: Downing Street is pushing hard for a trade deal but is making  contingency plans for an ""unruly"" exit from the EU transition period at the end of December. With trade talks looking set to go the wire, there is a risk they collapse — putting up trade barriers overnight on 1 January. In that scenario planners believe France will force ""mandatory controls on UK goods from day one"" and between 40 and 70 per cent of hauliers travelling across the Channel may not be ready for this. That could see flow between Dover and Calais down 45 per cent for three months, triggering long queues of HGVs in Kent. It could lead to shortages of the 30 per cent of our food imported from the EU as well as medicines, chemicals for drinking water purification and fuel supply. This could trigger water rationing and even power cuts. Food supply across the country would be hit by panic buying at Christmas, the busiest time of year. There are also increasing fears in Whitehall that Covid-19 will return with a vengeance in the winter months. The planners warned that ""pandemic influenza, severe flooding, a Covid second wave and an unruly exit from the EU transition period could cause a systemic economic crisis with major impact on disposable incomes, unemployment, business activity, international trade and market stability."" It could be combined with likely ""coordinated industrial action"" as well as shortages risking public disorder and a mental health crisis that will hit the poorest hardest. Rising virus infections and hospital admissions would require a possible return to two-metre social distancing rules and further lockdown restrictions ""well into 2021"". But, they fear, public compliance with anti-Covid measures could ""steadily wane"". And ministers have been warned the NHS could be overwhelmed by a ""one in 40-year flu scenario alongside even a continuation of the current levels of C19 and significantly overwhelmed in any level of second peak"". The document says five per cent of councils in England ""are already at high risk of financial failure following Covid-19"". It means some town halls may go bust and need bailing out or may need to be under direct control of Whitehall. And inflation could ""significantly impact social care providers due to increasing staff and supply costs"". Ministers have also been told to brace for a further 24 months of virus infections in care homes. There are fears of public disorder as a result of shortages and a major economic slump. The outlook is also bleak for Gibraltar and the Channel Islands, both reliant on imports. Gibraltar could be cut off from Spain and economically crippled and the Channel Islands may need airdrops of medicines and food. Three quarters of UK medicine imports come through Dover, and many have a limited shelf life — making stockpiling difficult. During the pandemic the focus on Covid has led to a slump in animal vaccine production. If the borders are jammed stockpiles could deplete, risking disease among livestock. When confronted by our leaked document the Cabinet Office outlined contingency plans to avoid the chaos: It includes extensive winter planning including an extra £3billion for the NHS and an extra £600million for social care. Covid-19 testing capacity will be extended to 300,000 a day and billions of items of PPE delivered to health and social care workers. A further £775million will be spent on new border and customs infrastructure and new border rules phased in over six months to try to avoid backlogs. There will also be an advertising blitz to get businesses ready for changes and encourage them to prepare supply chains and stockpiling of critical medicines. Data and finance rules will be relaxed to keep firms trading with the EU in the event of No Deal. Cabinet Office boss Michael Gove said: ""We got Brexit done with a great deal in January. ""And we are working flat out to make sure the UK is ready for the changes and huge opportunities at the end of the year as we regain our political and economic independence for the first time in almost 50 years. ""Part of this work includes routine contingency planning for various scenarios that we do not think will happen but we must be ready for, come what may. ""Whether we trade with the EU on terms similar to Canada or to Australia, a brighter future awaits as we forge our own path."" A Government spokesperson added: ""As a responsible government we continue to make extensive preparations for a wide range of scenarios, including the reasonable worst case. ""This is not a forecast or prediction of what will happen but rather a stretching scenario. It reflects a responsible government ensuring we are ready for all eventualities."""
608,608,The Sun,Harry Cole,Fuming Boris Johnson cuts Scottish camping trip short after three days because location was leaked,"ANGRY Boris Johnson had to pack up his tent and come home after his Scottish holiday location was leaked, The Sun can reveal. The PM had taken fiancée Carrie Symonds and new baby Wilfred for a break after a traumatic six months. It was his first getaway since the start of the coronavirus pandemic which saw him fall seriously ill with Covid-19 shortly before his son's birth at the end of April. But the windswept location was leaked when photos of his secluded Highland cottage and tent were published. Bodyguards said it wasn't safe for the family to stay on and it is understood they flew home on Thursday after just three days. A well placed source said: ""They had been camping in the garden of the cottage but the security threat was too much. ""The tent could be spotted by a sniper from too far away for them to stay after the location was published."" Pictures showed a teepee-style bell tent pitched near the holiday cottage and Mr Johnson looking casual in a bobble hat. The cosy three-bed cottage has a woodburning stove and understated furniture. The property has wood panelled walls and is adorned with watercolour paintings. Located on the seashore, The Old School has views towards the islands of Raasay, Rona and Skye and costs £1,600 a week to rent in high season. Dogs are allowed so Boris, 56, and Carrie, 32, were able to take their two-year-old Jack Russell cross Dilyn with them. The PM had pledged to tase a ""staycation"" this year and his break was nothing like as glamorous as other leaders such as Tony Blair have taken. Mr Johnson had planned to spend a week in the countryside, but locals tipped off paparazzi and pictures appeared that clearly identified where he was. The risk to the family included fears that they could be mobbed by Scottish nationalists. Members of Boris's security team were seen taking down the tent and removing other camping equipment. Scottish tourism bosses admitted this week that English visitors to their countryside had been put off by threats from local separatists. Last night Downing Street did not comment on the PM's holiday plans or security threats faced. By Lorraine Kelly WHEN I was a kid my mum and dad took me and my little brother camping to the Highlands of Scotland. It never stopped raining, the midgies left us miserable and itchy, and my brother and I argued and beat each other up for the duration. The only thing that would have made it even more hellish was if we'd taken along a squawking baby. Which is why I admire Carrie Symonds for tucking son Wilfred under her arm, taking Boris by the hand and setting off for a camping holiday by the coast. I've had some of the best holidays of my life in Scotland, especially Orkney, the Outer Hebrides and the Highlands, but never in a tent and not with a child that is a long way from being potty trained. Carrie is obviously very patient and understanding, and if she can survive that with a baby and an overgrown toddler, she deserves a medal. As for Boris, he got straight back to work after fighting coronavirus and took no paternity leave — only to have his getaway ended after three days. Give the man a break. Westminster was awash with claims his location was leaked by his Scottish nationalist adversaries. A senior Tory told The Sun: ""The finger of blame for this all getting out is being pointed at the SNP, particularly Ian Blackford who is local."" Mr Blackford hit back saying: ""This is completely preposterous and at no point have I referred publicly to the PM's whereabouts. It's nothing to do with me and to be smeared in this way is unacceptable."""
609,609,The Sun,Harry ColeJonathan ReillyNatasha Clark,Britain bouncing back after coronavirus lockdown with 90% of businesses open and millions of shoppers on high street,"BRITAIN is definitely bouncing back with nine in ten businesses open again, figures revealed today. The first official statistics detailing the return from lockdown reveal High Street and shopping centre activity is picking up. And traffic is almost back to normal levels — with 100 per cent of White Van Men back on the road. Experts and MPs have welcomed statistics showing that more people are getting out and about and boosting business after the Covid-19 crisis. The figures show nine in ten drivers have returned to the road and millions of shoppers are back on the High Street. But many office staff are failing to get back to work — which is affecting city centres. PM Boris Johnson looked at the positives and hailed the ""hugely encouraging"" signs. The Office for National Statistics data showed footfall at all retail locations is up to 68 per cent from a low of around ten per cent in early April. Shopping centres and High Streets are back to 60 per cent of last year's levels of visitors. Ninety-three per cent of businesses are back open. Seventy-seven per cent of firms said there was no risk or a low risk they could go bust. WHITE Van Men are steering Britain out of the slump — with figures showing virtually all are back on the road. Goods vehicles are once again clocking up their usual mileage. And overall road traffic is just nine per cent lower than before lockdown. Tonight, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""It's great to see people back out and about, using our roads to boost business and drive our economic recovery. ""Sun readers will be happy to see that we're setting out plans to spend £27billion on improving our roads — reducing congestion, pollution and journey times. ""And we aim to cut through red tape and get projects done faster."" But while many drivers are getting back on the roads, commuters are still shunning trains and buses. Train passenger numbers are only at 23 per cent of last year's levels. And bus usage is at just 41 per cent of what it was. In London, where millions of office staff are still working from home, Tube passenger numbers are 30 per cent the level of last year. The capital's buses are only 53 per cent full. A third said lockdown had not affected their turnover for this year. But half said they had seen a decrease. Just one in eight of the workforce remains on furlough. Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Eat Out to Help Out Scheme to boost restaurants, cafes and pubs was used 11 million times last week. Data up to Monday of this week showed road traffic just nine per cent lower than the equivalent Monday in February. Britain's White Van drivers are back to 100 per cent of pre-Covid-19 rates. ONS senior statistician Chloe Gibbs said: ""Road traffic data shows the number of car journeys is returning to normal levels as people venture out to shops and travel to work."" But many huge firms are still telling workers to stay home and it is having a major knock-on effect on rail, Tube and bus commuter numbers and the wider urban economy. It is a huge blow for cities like London, Birmingham and Manchester. Their centres became ghost towns during lockdown. Cafe chains including Pret a Manger have announced job cuts as a result of having fewer customers. Rail usage has slumped to 23 per cent of last year's levels, the Tube at 30 per cent and buses at 41 per cent. NEWS that Britain is bouncing back to normality is music to our ears. Last month, behavioural scientists worried that nervous Brits might let the economy tank rather than come out of hibernation. But they underestimated our resilience: High streets up and down the country are bustling once again . . . and ever-dependable White Van Man is back out on the road. We caution, though, against getting lulled into a false sense of security. New ONS data reveals that a whopping 12 per cent of employees are STILL on furlough, proving the extent to which the job retention scheme continues to prop up the economy. As the scheme tapers off, it's inevitable that thousands of hardworking and blameless employees will be let go. We're concerned too about the future of offices — and the cleaners, shop owners and transport workers who depend on their survival for work. On the Continent, the vast majority of city workers are back behind desks. But in the UK, business districts are ghosttowns as white collar employees find they like the work-from-home lifestyle. It would be churlish not to celebrate today's good news. But celebration must be tempered with pragmatism: The scarring effects of lockdown will be felt for months, if not years, to come. For a full recovery, we must all make a concerted effort to shore up the economy by going out to work, pubs and the shops. Tonight Tory grandee Iain Duncan Smith warned: ""Office workers, civil servants, those in big companies are really being shown up by the self-employed and small businesses who are all getting back to work and are thus helping the economy. ""It's down to these businesses and their office workers to recognise their responsibility, and get back to the office so they can help all the smaller businesses, the cafes, restaurants and bars in the centre of our towns and cities, so they are able to prosper again."" A No10 spokesman said: ""This data shows our economy and society have reopened successfully — and it is hugely encouraging this has happened without a resurgence in the virus."" By Theo Paphitis, Dragons' Den tycoon WE all faced tough times during lockdown and only when it was right did Prime Minister Boris Johnson give the green light for our shops to reopen. But customers have stayed away in droves, leaving the retail landscape looking like a series of ghost towns. Figures from the Office for National Statistics estimate that around 28,000 people in England currently have the coronavirus — less than 0.05 per cent of a population of around 60million. And while our neighbours in Europe have flocked backed to their offices, we've been more wary over here. Around 83 per cent of French white-collar workers are back at their desks, 75 per cent of Italians and 70 per cent of Germans. Here, it is just 33 per cent. That has a knock-on for those city centre businesses that rely on those workers for trade, such as sandwich shops and dry cleaners. Not forgetting trains and buses that ferry workers around. Already the job losses are piling up, with Marks & Spencer announcing it is shedding 7,000 staff over the next three months. I fear it could get a lot worse with many more thousands of jobs lost across the High Street. Pre-Covid, there was the hustle and bustle of happy shoppers thronging the stores while office workers were spending in their breaks. It breaks my heart to know that shoppers are staying away in their millions and thousands of staff are losing their jobs, with countless businesses being brought to their knees. But it's not just down to the public, we need action right from the very top of government. People need to have their confidence boosted, and while everyone appreciates we are in unprecedented times and it is tough, it is also the responsibility of the Government to show the way back, just like our counterparts have done in Europe We need support for entrepreneurs with low rents in new or abandoned units. And councils could use their compulsory purchase powers to turn empty buildings into places where businesses can thrive once more with good, safe public transport. Add to that safe cycling, rent ""holidays"" and flexible-term agreements to help get businesses back on their feet. So come on shoppers, shop and office workers, let's get our High Streets and city centres buzzing again."
610,610,The Sun,Harry ColeJonathan ReillyNatasha Clark,"Shops, businesses and traffic all returning as Britain finally starts to feel normal again","THE best sign yet that Britain is bouncing back emerged today as good news stats showed things FINALLY returning to normal with nine in 10 business open again. New data from the Office of National Statistics showed that despite new laws for face coverings, High Street shopping is BACK to over two thirds of usual levels and traffic on the roads is BACK to the same level as February. And White Van heroes are back to 100 per cent of their pre-Covid driving rates. It comes as four in five businesses say that they are finally in good health - with only one per cent saying they have a 'severe risk' of going bust. The ONS said things are ""returning back to normal levels as people venture out to shops and travel to work"". It comes after 33million meals were scoffed using the Government's Eat Out To Help Out scheme launched at the start of August. Bustling restaurants were packed out and booked up across the nation as people fought to get their discounted dinners. Their stats showed: A third of businesses said lockdown had not affected their turnover for this year, the stats revealed today. However, half said that theirs had decreased. Road traffic across all motor vehicles has been gradually returning to pre-lockdown levels following a low point around the end of March 2020 when the nation was told they must stay at home. Data up to Monday 17 August showed overall road traffic was just 9 per cent points lower than traffic seen on the equivalent Monday in the first week of February. While drivers are getting back on the roads, the government has a lot of work to do to convince people it is safe to use trains and buses. National Rail services are only at 23 per cent of the same levels last year. While nationally bus usage is also only at 41 per cent. Shopping footfall in businesses is up over the last week, following a steady increase in recent weeks as people start to venture out again. In London - where millions of office workers are still working from home - the tube passenger numbers are just 30 per cent from the same time last year, while London buses are only 53 per cent full. Chloe Gibbs, senior statistician at the ONS, said: ""Despite recent economic news, it is encouraging to see that four in five businesses say they are at no or low risk of going bust. ""Road traffic data show that the number of car journeys is returning back to normal levels as people venture out to shops and travel to work."" Boris Johnson has told everyone to start going back to work if they can. Even people who are sheilding are now allowed to go into the office. But many huge firms are still telling their workers to stay home. It's having a huge effect on cities like London, Birmingham and Manchester as the centres became ghost towns during lockdown. Cafe chains including Pret have already announced job cuts as a result of fewer people coming in to use their stores."
611,611,The Sun,Harry Cole,Fresh Tory civil war after new Scots boss suggests Gavin Williamson SHOULD quit over exams fiasco,"THE row over Gavin Williamson's future exploded into Tory civil war today after the outspoken new boss of the Scottish Conservatives suggested he should quit after the exams fiasco. Douglas Ross plunged the Government into a cross-border war of words after urging the embattled Education Secretary to ""reflect on what happened"" and refused to back him staying in his job. Mr Ross took the reins of the party north of the border after spectacularly resigning himself from a junior ministerial role in protest over the Dominic Cummings lockdown saga in May. The part-time elite linesman and MP for Moray told an interview on Thursday morning: ""I'm not here to say in your report that I think Gavin Williamson has done a great job and he should continue. ""I think he has to reflect on what happened to so many pupils in England, students who were concerned for four days, because we had the exact same up here in Scotland for a week."" His comments came after Mr Williamson apologised to thousands of pupils and parents across England after abandoning a computer marking system that plunged A-Level results in chaos. A week before, Mr Ross had demanded that Scotland's Education Secretary John Swinney resign after a similar blunder, that was quickly u-turned over in Holyrood. Mr Ross told Radio Scotland: ""I think Gavin Williamson and the government and the Department for Education will be reflecting on why did they not see the problem that the SNP had to deal with as a result of their actions in Scotland."" Downing Street did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Today Mr Ross told the Scottish Sun he's not doomed to be another SNP election scalp like Jo Swinson or Jim Murphy. But he risked antagonising No10 with lukewarm remarks about Boris Johnson. And when asked if he ""admired"" the PM, the Scots Tory leader replied: ""I admire any prime minister or leader of any country."" As the Sun reported yesterday, senior Cabinet colleagues believe Mr Williamson is ""on his last life"" after the exams fiasco and will be swiftly sacked if schools reopening is botched. No10 does not dispute Williamson offered to resign but Mr Williamson is under huge pressure not to botch getting kids back to their desks next month."
612,612,The Sun,Harry Cole,Sudanese people smuggler jailed after trying to ferry two kids and seven adults across the Channel in a tiny dingy,"A SUDANESE criminal has been jailed for two years after trying to smuggle NINE migrants across the channel in a tiny boat. Altaib Mobarak, 43, was detained by a Border Force cutter on 7 July with two children and seven other adults in a dingy. He had previously been spotted trying to avoid the French coastguard to reach British waters in the inflatable boat. On Tuesday he was sent down at Canterbury Crown Court after admitting a charge of facilitating illegal entry into the UK at an earlier hearing. All 10 people on board  – Sudanese and Yemeni nationals - were transferred to the cutter and brought to Dover where they were passed to immigration officials. Mobarak was arrested and later confessed to being at the helm. The Home Office's new Clandestine Channel Threat Commander Dan O'Mahoney said: ""People should seek asylum in the first safe country they enter. ""Those attempting to cross the Channel, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, in unsuitable boats and without appropriate maritime skills are putting at risk the lives of all those on board. ""It is of particular concern when, as was the case here, vulnerable children are involved. He added: ""It is precisely because of this risk to life – a reality that we have seen confirmed in yesterday's tragic incident – that we are determined to put a stop to these dangerous crossings."" Mr O'Mahoney, who was appointed last month, is in France today urging the Paris authorities to take tougher action in France to stop the crossings. The crisis on the Channel hit a new low after a 16-year-old migrant boy was found dead on a French beach was desperately trying to reach the UK before the arrival of Storm Ellen. The Sudanese youngster, along with a companion, had got into difficulty in the sea in the early hours of Wednesday morning and was discovered at Sangatte, near Calais. The unnamed youth set off from the Descenderie de Sangatte beach with a friend in a 'small makeshift inflatable craft' soon after midnight on Wednesday morning. They got into difficulties straightaway, with the boat capsizing, and both Sudanese nationals being swept overboard. The companion, suffering from hypothermia, reported that the boy may still be in the water and could not swim after a fisherman working on the shoreline saw the boat capsize and immediately called emergency services. Philippe Sabatier, deputy prosecutor, confirmed that a criminal enquiry had been opened into the 16-year-old's death. He said: ""One young man was rescued in the sea soon afterwards, and he reported his friend missing, it is thus very likely that this missing person corresponds to the body found."" He added that a makeshift boat was later found on the beach, along with a mobile phone, documents and 'a shovel that would have been used as an oar'."
613,613,The Sun,Harry ColeDan Keane,Gavin Williamson ‘was warned A-level and GCSE grades could be wrong’ weeks before fiasco,"EMBATTLED Gavin Williamson was warned that A-level and GCSE grades could be wrong weeks before the results fiasco, it has been reported. The education secretary has defied calls to resign over the results debacle and is now said to be  'on his last life' - and could be swiftly sacked if the  reopening of schools is botched next month. In a further blow, a senior source at the Department of Education told The Times that Sir Jon Coles, a former director-general at the Department, wrote to Williamson early last month expressing concern about Ofqual's controversial algorithm. In the letter, Sir Jon warned that the model being used for GCSE and A-Level grading would at best only be 75 per cent accurate - resulting in hundreds of thousands of students receiving botched grades. Ofqual's own testing of the model found the accuracy of the model to be in the range of 50 to 60 per cent. According to the Times, Mr Williamson then held a video-conference with Sir Jon to discuss the points raised in the letter in mid-July. However, the education secretary chose to push ahead with the plans anyway - fearing accusations of grade inflation or a delay to exam results. A government source told the paper that Mr Williamson had raised the problems expressed by Sir Jon to Ofqual days after the meeting, but the regulator had given him reassurances there would be no problems come results day. The report contradicts Mr Williamson's claim that the scale of the problem  only became clear over the weekend. It comes as ministers and MPs told The Sun today that Williamson would not be able to survive another scandal next month if he blunders Mr Johnson's flagship pledge to reopen schools. And senior Tories reject claims Mr Johnson is protecting the former Chief Whip - who helped organise the PM's successful takeover of the party - amid fears he ""not only buried all the bodies but still has the shovel"". One government insider said: ""Gavin talks a good game but the People's Government will not be blackmailed by anyone."" The warnings came as Health Secretary Matt Hancock hinted that Mr Williamson had not been given the boot because of his crucial role in implementing Mr Johnson's promise to parents that pupils will be back at their desks at the start of the new term. Matt Hancock said calls for Mr Williamson to quit were a distraction at a time when he is focused on the major task of reopening schools And he insisted that all Ministers are ""trying to do their best"" in unprecedented circumstances ""and I know that is true of Gavin Williamson"". Mr Williamson is under intense pressure after he was forced to abandon the algorithm-based system for awarding A-level and GCSE grades in England. The U-turn came too late for thousands of A-level students who have already made choices about universities based on the grades they were initially awarded, rather than the new system of using teachers' assessments. But Mr Hancock defended his fellow Cabinet minister, saying that he is focused on trying to get all children back to school for the new term after their education was disrupted by coronavirus closures. ""These are unprecedented circumstances and I think everybody is working their hardest and trying to do their best in very difficult circumstances, and I know that is true of Gavin Williamson as it is of all members of the Government."" He told Sky News: ""The big focus is on getting schools back and open at the start of next month, an incredibly important task. ""I don't think we should be distracted from that task now. We need to absolutely focus on it."""

But the latest union attempt to halt a return to the classroom was branded a ""hard-left wrecking ball to our children's futures"". The demand would currently see pupils not back at desks in cities and towns including Bradford, Blackburn and Oldham, with Swindon and Rochdale also nudging the cut-off point. The Education Solidarity Network, a left-wing faction in the National Education Union, will hold street protests on Friday across Britain with a list of safety demands such as free PPE and weekly Covid tests for teachers. And it announced tonight it wants to be able to close classrooms if local infection rates hit its chosen level. ESN boss and secondary school teacher James Kerr said: ""We have already lost colleagues to the virus and will lose more if there is not action."" He added: ""It's not the Victorian era anymore. Every worker should be able to go to work in the knowledge that they will return alive and well."" More moderate bosses of the biggest teachers unions distanced themselves from the ESN's cut-off figure. But they warned: ""We have to prepare for a range of possible scenarios — including pupils and teachers having to isolate."" The NEU's spokesman added: ""We are pressing the Government on the need to have a robust track, trace and test programme in place and a Plan B in the case of local lockdowns or a second spike."" PM Boris Johnson has said schools will be the last thing to close even in areas experiencing a resurgence of the virus. And today a key ally rejected the latest plot by organised teachers and urged Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to do the same. Conservative Party co-chairman Amanda Milling hit out: ""This hard-left action takes a wrecking ball to our children's futures. ""Sir Keir Starmer and the NEU need to take a stand and put a stop to this action that puts the future of so many young people at risk. ""Getting children back to school is a key priority and we should all be working together to get pupils back safely. ""We have a detailed plan and it's time for Labour and the NEU to work with us to ensure the life chances of a generation of schoolchildren — particularly the most disadvantaged — are not lost to coronavirus."" But a Labour source warned that schools reopening risked being a ""fiasco"" like exam results due to blundering ministers. The row came as senior Tories warned Gavin Williamson is ""on his last life"" and will be swiftly sacked if the reopening of schools is botched. The embattled Education Secretary has defied calls to quit from opposition parties following the A-levels grading scandal. But No10 does not dispute Mr Williamson offered to fall on his sword. Fellow Cabinet ministers and MPs have told The Sun he would not survive another scandal next month if he botches Mr Johnson's flagship pledge to reopen schools.

615,615,The Sun,Harry Cole,Britain may boycott 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing as diplomatic relations with China head for a freeze,"MINISTERS may boycott Beijing's 2022 Winter Olympics as diplomatic relations with China head for a freeze. Rows over Covid-19, Hong Kong and Huawei may see royals and the Government snub the event. The stance would mirror that at the World Cup in Russia 2018 two months after the Novichok gas attack in Salisbury. A senior minister said: ""Awkward conversations are having to be had about it."" On Tuesday night a government source insisted that no decision had yet been made. However ex-Cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith urged the Government to lobby the International Olympic Committee to change the venue. He said: ""China is dictatorial, aggressive and intolerant. I don't see how any self-respecting British citizen could go there to endorse this regime. ""From the torture and sterilisation of Uighur Muslims, to the smashing of the Sino-British agreement over Hong Kong."" Alan Mendoza, of foreign policy think-tank The Henry Jackson Society, added: ""Until China starts playing by the rules, the only salute we should be giving them is a two-fingered one."""
616,616,The Sun,Harry Cole,Fears Swindon will be plunged into lockdown as it has highest coronavirus rate in south England – but Leicester reopens,"FEARS are growing that Swindon could be the next town to be hit with lockdown — as it has the highest covid rates in the south of England. Ministers are worried after 43 people tested positive in the Wiltshire town last week. And they fear the surge in cases will require North West style special measures. Public Health England's latest data has Swindon as the 5th highest infection rate with 48.2 cases per 100,000 and list the area as one of concern. That is the highest in the south of England however the local council insist that the outbreak is under control, and that enforcement of lockdown measures would be a ""last resort"". But a Health department source said the town was in ""the danger zone."" Health workers are patrolling with information and the mobile testing units have been set up. A council spokesman said: ""Public health colleagues are doing a fantastic job in responding to multiple small outbreaks across the town in an effort to break the chain of infection and keep all Swindon residents safe."" At the weekend Swindon South MP Robert Buckland said the council was ""working tirelessly"" to help prevent a community-based outbreak. The concerns came as Leicester was finally freed from lockdown measures slapped on in June. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock said coronavirus cases remain too high to ease all the restrictions in the city. Nail bars, beauty salons and tanning booths can reopen from Wednesday, while guidance telling outdoor music venues and theatres to stay closed will be dropped. But residents in the lockdown area will not be able to meet inside a private home or garden of someone they have not formed a ""support bubble"" with. The easing will bring the city into line with the easing of restrictions introduced for much of the nation on July 11 and 13. Mr Hancock said: ""My gratitude goes out to the people of Leicester who have all made sacrifices to keep the virus at bay and protect their local communities. ""The rate of infection has now dropped to a safe enough level to allow further businesses including beauty salons, nail bars and some outdoor venues to reopen in the area. ""Current restrictions on gatherings must remain in place to further bring down the rate of infection."" Spas, massage and tattoo parlours, and body and skin piercing services will also be able to reopen on Wednesday morning. But the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said infection rates are still too high for a full easing, so restrictions on gatherings will continue in line with Greater Manchester and parts of West Yorkshire and east Lancashire. Shielding for the most vulnerable will continue but with easing in Leicester to allow individuals to meet in a group of up to six people outdoors while maintaining social distancing."
617,617,The Sun,Harry Cole,Britain must bounce back and Boris Johnson is right to say he will not be forced into bad Brexit deal,"AS he staycations in his tent in Scotland this week, no one could blame the Prime Minister for being reflective about the past year's ups and downs. From being written off in the backbench wilderness, to king of the Tory party. From an almighty rollicking from our most senior judges, to Brexit champion. From the most successful election winner in a generation, to captain of the ship when it hit the terrifying rocks of the pandemic. Throw into that his own brush with death from the virus — and the joy of a new baby son — for good measure. It has been on one hell of a ride. But Boris Johnson needs to put all that behind him and get ready for four months that could make that rollercoaster look like a bouncy castle. Enjoy your holiday, Prime Minister, because winter is coming. As Westminster goes ""back to school"" in September, the Downing Street in-tray is heaving with mammoth tasks. Any one, in normal times, would test the most brilliant of administrations. But as the PM and his closest Cabinet colleagues admit privately, the corona crisis has revealed that the machine of Government is not in great nick. Colourful metaphors float around Whitehall: Ministers pulling levers to find they are made of chocolate; No10 pedalling on a bike that doesn't have a chain. But letting rows about reform and an internal rewiring of the system dominate will be met with short shrift by a public willing to forgive early mistakes in the crisis but who will likely be very unimpressed if the chaos continues. The first key to unlocking Britain's recovery is to get the schools back in September. We have heard good, solid words that the kids will be back at their desks by hook or by crook. But the past week of damaging A-level chaos and a potential week ahead of GCSE uproar does not exactly scream that all is well in the Department for Education. Gavin Williamson — or Frank Spencer, as he is now nicknamed in Cabinet circles — might be an easy target. But the buck stops with No10. And if anyone can talk ""vision"", it is Boris. So perhaps we need to hear a bit more from him. As furlough winds down and unemployment creeps higher, November's Budget is the next red light on the dashboard. At his first Budget in March, Rishi Sunak set aside a whopping £30billion for the emergency measures. The near-£350billion he will have spent this year makes that a comedic drop in the ocean. And now the golden boy of the Government has to work out how to pay for it all. Tory MPs will be hoping the Chancellor will return to those Thatcherite instincts he boasted about. But there will be massive pressure from the Treasury establishment for him to turn to ""revenue raisers"" — higher taxes to you and me. Yet Mr Sunak should be very careful here. Tax hikes on already strained incomes represent the quickest and easiest way to turn this recession into another Great Depression. Duty increases on booze are the last thing the struggling hospitality industry needs. Let's not clobber motorists who simply want to return to work, either. If the Treasury insists, a rise in capital-gains tax on second-home sales would be fairer. And Rishi and Boris should seek another way to solve our economic doldrums: Brexit, the PM's other huge in-tray issue. The New Year deadline for a Brussels trade deal is right when ministers fear there could be a second Covid wave. But Mr Johnson rightly says he is not going to be bounced into a deal and the chances of No Deal are growing. We have already seen economic disruption on a scale far worse than anything predicted by Remainers. The scaremongering will not work this time, with a battle-hardened public. Bouncing back Any deal must not stop Britain becoming a more tempting investment opportunity than the Continent, allowing ministers to harness our new-found freedom to fix the Covid mess. There are growing whispers that the EU's demand of so-called ""level playing-field rules"" — in reality, continued red tape and Britain bound to Brussels law for ever — could be too much to overcome. Hopes of a deal could be shelved and instead issues such as security cooperation and financial service agreements would have to be forged separately, possibly with the more pragmatic EU states. How years more of smaller side negotiations tallies with Mr Johnson's claims to have ""got Brexit done"" is a tricky one. But it's better than being bounced into a deal that will stop Britain bouncing back."
618,618,The Sun,Harry ColeKate Ferguson,Bungling Education Secretary Gavin Williamson fighting to cling on to his job after A Levels meltdown,"BUNGLING Gavin Williamson is fighting to cling on to his Cabinet job in the wake of the A Levels meltdown. No10 is livid with the Education Secretary after he presided over a string of humiliating school disasters. He U-turned on a vow to get all primary school pupils back to class before summer, and sparked nationwide fury with the marking shambles. And if next week's GCSE results end up in an A Levels-style disaster, it could be the final straw for his Cabinet career. Cabinet colleagues have sharpened their knives against Mr Williamson, with one cruelly comparing him to the gaffe-prone Frank Spencer in the sitcom Some Mothers Do Ave Em. They told The Sun: ""It turns out putting Frank Spencer in charge of running schools wasn't a good idea."" Meanwhile, a growing number of furious Tory MPs joined the backlash against the A Level marking chaos. A staggering 39 per cent of marks were controversially downgraded by a computer moderating system – sparking a mutiny among teachers, pupils and parents. Julian Sturdy, the Tory MP for York, called for the grades to be ripped up and the higher teacher marks dished out in a Scotland-style U-turn. He fumed: ""These are unprecedented times. ""We should be looking after these students' futures rather than worrying about grade inflation."" Tory MP for Telford Lucy Allan lashed: ""An algorithm that awards a 'U' to a student that did not have the chance to turn up for an exam is fundamentally flawed."" It comes as ministers are braced for an even bigger row when GCSE results are handed out next week. These grades have also been moderated by a computer, and experts have warned of absolute carnage as hundreds of thousands of kids find out their results. Another Tory MP warned: ""What has happened with A levels is going to be a cup of tea compared to next week."" Mr Williamson has insisted the results had to be moderated otherwise grade inflation would have gone supersonic, leaving kids with worthless qualifications. But the Labour Party was also plunged into chaos after they carried out a screeching U-turn on their A Levels policy. Angela Rayner hit the airwaves demanding teacher's predicted grades are used, just months after she said they could not be trusted. The deputy leader told the BBC: ""We believe the only option that the Government have got now is to go back to the teacher-awarded grades because they've made such a fiasco."" But back in April she backed the moderation of teacher grades. She told FE News: ""We have always said predicted grades are not always accurate, and can disproportionately affect the children who need the most support, and we pushed ministers to ensure students can sit an exam later if they wish."" A STAGGERING two million GCSE results are set to be downgraded next week, alarming research suggests. The shocking figures would spark chaos for tens of thousands of kids, who are anxiously waiting for their results. And disadvantaged kids are expected to be hardest hit by the grade cuts, The Guardian reported. And it would be a major blow for the Government, which is already under massive pressure over the A Levels grading fiasco. Nearly a million teens will get their GCSEs next Thursday, which for the first time ever are based on teachers' predictions which are then moderated by a computer algorithm. But between 35 and 40 per cent of grades are expected to be cut down by the computer, experts at the FFT Education Datalab research unit told the Guardian. Philip Nye, a researcher at the Datalab, said: ""We found that schools that were lower-attaining and with more disadvantaged intakes were submitting higher grades. ""So we think that GCSE results will see more disadvantaged pupils have their results lowered through the moderation process. ""There are more disadvantaged pupils taking GCSEs than there are at A-levels, so potentially downgrades could be more widespread."" Mass downgrading of GCSEs would heap yet more pressure on Gavin Williamson, who is battling to cling on to his job of Education Secretary. A staggering 39 per cent of A Level grades were cut in the markings chaos – sparking fury among parents, kids and teachers The government is facing mounting calls to U-turn on the system, tear up the results, and dish out the higher teacher grades instead. And Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham threatened to ask the courts to intervene. Mr Burnham said he believes the system used to mark A-levels is ""inherently biased"" against larger educational institutions. He said: ""Given that a higher proportion of students from Greater Manchester attend such institutions than in other parts of the country, I am concerned that the marking system has been unfairly discriminatory against young people here, in part due to the institutions they attend. ""I am considering all options to challenge this unfair process, including a legal challenge against the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation."""
619,619,The Sun,Natasha ClarkHarry Cole,Brits heading to France face 2-week quarantine when they arrive as French vow to force self-isolation in retaliation,"THOUSANDS of holidaymakers heading to France face a two-week isolation on arrival. Last night Emmanual Macron plunged thousands of sunseekers into travel chaos by vowing revenge quarantine rules on new arrivals - but no one told the Brits the details. The move follows the announcement that people arriving in the UK from France after 4am on Saturday will be required to spend 14 days in self-isolation due to rising numbers of coronavirus cases there. France's secretary of state for European affairs said the UK decision would lead to ""reciprocal measures"" across the Channel. Clement Beaune tweeted: ""A British decision which we regret and which will lead to reciprocal measures, all in hoping for a return for normal as soon as possible."" The French transport minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari also tweeted to say France ""regrets the UK decision"" and ""will apply reciprocal measures"". He said he wanted to have similar rules in place ""to ensure a high level of protection on both sides of the Channel"". But no information was provided on when it would kick in or how strict it would be. Ministers fear the furious French will slap a ban on visiting Brits going to shops, bars and restaurants as soon as the weekend or Monday. That left thousands of defiant Brits arriving in France for their holidays this weekend - and prepared to quarantine when they got home - confused over whether they will be ordered to stay locked down in campsites and hotels for 14 days, risking further holiday ruin. If brought in, it will mean that anyone who does have to travel to France will face being unable to go to the shops, or visit restaurants when they get there. Anyone visiting France will face two weeks quarantining when they arrive - and another two weeks on the other end when they return to the UK. The latest 14-day cumulative figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control show 32.1 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people in France, compared with 18.5 in the UK. The Netherlands has also responded and told its citizens not to travel to Britain after ministers put quarantine measures on returning travellers from the country. A spokesman for the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: ""This means that Great Britain will receive a code orange as travel advice, because the Dutch have to be quarantined there."" The Dutch code orange means the Government advises against travel to the UK - but they haven't imposed quarantine restrictions. Brits face a desperate scramble today to get back from France before the quarantine measures come into force. La France regrette la décision du Royaume Uni et appliquera des mesures de réciprocité dans le champ des transports. J'ai dit à mon homologue @grantshapps notre volonté d'harmoniser les protocoles sanitaires pour assurer un haut niveau de protection des deux côtés de la Manche. https://t. co/bH7LkqD3LB But already travel operators are saying they are fully booked until the weekend. Channel Tunnel said spots for car crossings had sold out and urged people not to turn up and hope for a slot. Seats on a British Airways flight from Paris' Charles De Gaulle airport to Heathrow on Friday quadrupled in price - from £100 to £407 - after the Government's announcement. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps urged people not to bother turning up to ports unless they had a booking already. It would only create queues and people would be left ""disappointed"", he said this morning. He said people shouldn't be surprised at the move as the Government warned it could happen. He said: ""I think a lot of people would have been aware that this was a possibility in France and in some of these other countries."" Last night France was forced onto the unsafe list after suffering a recent high in its number of virus cases. The country had seen a 66 per cent hike in cases in the last week, forcing the Government to act. Malta and the Netherlands have also been removed from the quarantine-free safe travel list. The Foreign Office updated its advice to warn against all but essential travel to the country because of the coronavirus risk too. Une décision britannique que nous regrettons et qui entraînera une mesure de réciprocité, en espérant un retour à la normale le plus rapidement possible @Djebbari_JB https://t. co/6pA0qDQun6 Brits were in a scramble to get back today if they could. Nurse Helen Gandy in France told the BBC: ""When we left the infection rates were low, now we are worrying we are going to have to quarantine when we get back. ""We are about 8.5 hours from Calais, right in the south. We have a shuttle booked. We are hoping we might be able to get onto an earlier crossing. that is adding to the stress as well. ""We are just hours away from the 4am cut off, which is frustrating."" Ian, who has been in France since August 7, dashed to his computer to secure return tickets back to the UK as soon as he heard the news last night. He said: ""Immediately we saw France added to the list, we got onto the internet on three computers on various booking sites, we have been very lucky and got a ferry crossing from Dunkirk."""
620,620,The Sun,"Harry Cole, Political Editor",Football fans will be able to return to stadiums next month as lockdown restrictions are loosened further,"FOOTBALL fans will finally begin returning to stadiums next month — but may not be allowed to sing. A further easing of lockdown rules will also see snooker lovers back in the Crucible this weekend for the World Championship. Rugby matches and racing at Goodwood are also on the list of approved ""pilot"" events in the coming weeks. But capacity will be capped and all fans will likely be urged not to chant or shout for fear of spreading the virus. The new Premier League season starts on September 12. Trials of allowing some fans back in stadiums will be tested later that month ahead of a planned full rollout in October. Spectators will be made to sign up to a new code of behaviour. It will make them take full responsibility for themselves and others by not attending if they have Covid symptoms or have been exposed to anyone with them. And strict crowd management plans will be enforced with one-way entry and exit and staggered arrival times. Seating will be socially distanced and hand washing and sanitiser stations set up. But no trials are scheduled for the North West, which remains under stricter control. Tonight Boris Johnson said: ""At every stage I have said our plan to reopen society and the economy is conditional. ""Today we are able to announce some further changes which will allow more people to return to work and the public to get back to more of the things they have missed. GET in there! The return of football since mid-June has been an absolute joy, with no shortage of excitement on the pitch, but something has definitely been missing. That something is the crowd. Supporters are the lifeblood of the game so it's great news that stadiums could see a return of fans for the new season, albeit at a quarter of capacity. It's just a shame they might not be allowed to sing, whether they're winning or not. ""However, as I have always said, we will not hesitate to put on the brakes if required, or to continue to implement local measures to help to control the spread of the virus."" Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden added: ""The nation's hard work to keep the virus under control means we can now make further careful progress. ""We must all continue to Stay Alert but today's welcome news means these organisations can finally get going safely, and we can enjoy more of the things we love as a nation."""
621,621,The Sun,Jonathan ReillyHarry ColeNatasha Clark,France on UK quarantine list: Half a million Brit holidaymakers in desperate dash to get home as holidays ruined,"HALF a million Brits face a desperate dash to get home after France was last night kicked off the Government's safe list. Thousands were set to spark a ""mini Dunkirk"" as they prepare to evacuate  for Blighty amid a spike in coronavirus cases across holiday spots. The Government's decision gives half a million Brits currently in France less than a day to get back if they want to avoid going into quarantine. But with flights fully booked and the Channel Tunnel packed, many will miss the deadline of 4am tomorrow. Families with children now risk missing the first week of school as  14-day self-isolation measures are re-imposed. Another 500,000 Brits due to travel to France in the coming weeks will have their holiday plans thrown into chaos. What we know so far: The Netherlands and Malta were also added to the quarantine list last night. Boris Johnson said yesterday that he had to be ""absolutely ruthless"" over imposing the travel rules, ""even with our closest and dearest friends and partners"" The PM added: ""I think everybody understands that. ""We can't be remotely complacent about our own situation. ""Everybody understands that in a pandemic you don't allow our population to be re-infected or the disease to come back in. Are you stranded in France? Call The Sun Online newsdesk on 0207 782 4368, WhatsApp us on 07810 791 502 or email tips@the-sun. co. uk ""That is why the quarantine measures are very important and we have to apply them in a very strict way."" Seats on a British Airways flight from Paris' Charles De Gaulle airport to Heathrow on Friday quadrupled in price - from £100 to £407 - after the Government's announcement. Channel Tunnel operator Getlink said extra services may be laid on but warned many passengers face missing out on the quarantine deadline. John Keefe, Getlink's director of public affairs, told BBC Newsnight the trains were ""already pretty much fully booked"" today. The Sun can reveal that concerned medics intervened to warn the PM that France's numbers were starting to spiral out of control. Ministers had hoped cases would flatten so they would not have to remove it  from the ""green list""  — countries where people do not have to self-isolate upon return. But France recorded 2,669 new Covid-19 cases yesterday — a record outside of lockdown. The infection rate over 14 days rose to 32.1 per 100,000. Anyone found breaching the quarantine rules faces a £1,000 fine. The PM risks a row with France's president Emmanuel Macron, who was on holiday yesterday in the South of France. Downing Street also fears tit-for-tat quarantine measures will be imposed by France on any Brit tourists arriving there next week. Restrictions have been imposed on 20 of the largest French cities. Paris, Toulouse, Lille and Biarritz are among those ordering people to wear masks in  outdoor areas. Travel experts warned that any quarantine decision on France — Brits' second-most popular holiday destination — will be another blow to an industry reeling from Covid. Q: What does the quarantine involve? A: ANYONE returning from France, Malta or the Netherlands will have to fill in an online passenger locator form upon arrival in the UK. You will need to indicate how you travelled, your contact details and address where you will isolate for 14 days. You can have necessities delivered but must stay away from others. Q: What if I don't quarantine? A: YOU could be fined up to £1,000. If you move address after giving one for quarantine, and fail to update to the new one you can be fined up to £3,200. Q: I've booked flights to a quarantine country. Can I get my money back if I don't want to travel? A: EASYJET and British Airways are allowing customers the chance to rebook, accept a credit note or get a refund. Ryanair will not offer refunds but will allow you to change flight dates without a change fee. Many airlines plan to continue to fly so it is important to check. Q: Will Eurotunnel and ferry crossings be cancelled? Will I get my money back? A: FERRY firms and Eurotunnel are planning to continue services for now. If you choose not to travel contact them about your options. Most are offering to postpone or rearrange crossings for later in the year if you have booked a flexible ticket. Other tickets will be considered on a case-by-case basis but you may be allowed to rebook. Paul Charles, of consultancy The PC Agency, said: ""No one in the travel sector wants France to be added to the quarantine list. ""It is such a vital market to keep open. He added: ""The Government needs to be ruthless on providing the world's best testing regime rather than the economically- damaging quarantine policy."" Monaco and Caribbean destinations Aruba and the Turks and Caicos  were also booted off the green list, meaning people returning from those places from tomorrow will also need to self-isolate for 14 days. But Gibraltar was  reprieved. Brits heading home from France last night gave their reaction. Robert Chmielewski, 33, from Basingstoke, Hants, was on a UK-bound ferry  after visiting pals. He said: ""I knew quarantine was coming. Some announcements have been chaos so I thought I should head home. ""It's a bit of luck."" Ruth Thompson, 35, of Bristol, said: ""I had to get out. ""Cases had been creeping up for a few days. It became too much of a risk. Roger Slight, 50, Gerrards Cross, Bucks, was going the other way  but said he hopes he won't be affected because he is just travelling through France in a camper van. On Wednesday there were 1,009 new cases of coronavirus in Britain — less than half the total in France. Prof Tim Spector,  at King's College London, said: ""It's encouraging to see   numbers  coming down slightly, and that isolated outbreaks in the North appear to be well contained so far. ""This is further confirmation that we aren't at the beginning of a second wave and, rather, still trying to end the first. ""The figures also suggest that the outbreaks in countries such as Belgium, France and Spain aren't having an effect here in the UK yet. ""And people flocking to beaches and parks doesn't seem to be having the predicted negative impact."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, announcing the new travel rules last night, added to the chaos by getting the deadline day wrong — saying it was Sunday instead of tomorrow. The Sun understands that Downing Street  initially intended it to be Sunday, but the Scottish and Welsh governments pressed for tomorrow. Employers cannot claim back statutory sick pay, and have no obligation to pay wages to those in quarantine, although many  do. Brits with no hope of getting back before the  changes will be able to claim Universal Credit if they are not paid during their self-isolation. However there are calls from backbench Tory MPs for the Government to pay the wages of tourists if they are caught out by rule changes while already away. The Foreign Office will advise against all ""non-essential"" travel to France —  but it will  mean  those due to head there on holiday will be able to claim their cash back."
622,622,The Sun,Harry Cole,"Face mask fines hiked to £3,200 and £10k penalties for raves as ministers fear young Brits are ignoring rules","FINES for not wearing masks are to be hiked to up to £3,200. The move comes amid fears that young people could fuel a second wave of coronavirus in Britain. Organisers of illegal lockdown raves will also be slapped with £10,000 fines. Ministers are worried that young people — who are rarely affected by the virus — are flouting social distancing and mask wearing rules. As a result, they risk spreading Covid-19 to elderly relatives, with deadly consequences. People face a £100 fine for not wearing a mask. Repeat offenders will now see fines double each time — all the way up to a maximum of £3,200. It is compulsory to wear face coverings on public transport, in shops and when collecting takeaway food. Last month Met Police boss Dame Cressida Dick said she would prefer for shoppers to be ""shamed"" into wearing masks rather than officers have to enforce the rules. But concern among ministers and medics that too many were ignoring this tactic, led Boris Johnson to last night order a clampdown. Illegal raves that have seen thousands of young people across Britain flout social distancing measures are also his ministers sights. Known as ""forest parties"", they are promoted on social media and have sprung up across the country. The Met says more than 530 illegal raves were held in July in the capital, with police across the country also battling all night gatherings. Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ""These measures send a clear message — if you don't cooperate with the police and if you put our health at risk, action will follow."""

Duncan Lewis Solicitors boasted that their legal threats meant 19 were removed from a Home Office charter flight on Wednesday. All 19 had previously been through other European countries and should have their asylum claims dealt with under the EU's Dublin Convention. That says those seeking refuge should apply in the first safe country they reach. The firm describe themselves ""as legal practitioners representing clients in matters close to Labour's heart"" and regularly attend party events. Their lawyers have been at party fundraisers and even posed for snaps with MPs including Home Affairs Committee boss Yvette Cooper and held ""exciting"" meetings with Jeremy Corbyn and Diane Abbott. On Thursday night the firm said: ""It's hardly surprising that a law firm that challenges government policies would talk to the Opposition."" But the Home Office insisted: ""These flights are a key part of the UK's strategy to stop the illegally facilitated crossings."" More migrants in dinghies on Thursday arrived in Dover, for a record 10th day in a row. More than 900 have arrived since Tuesday of last week."
