0,Real,The Sun,"CHANNEL migrants could be electronically tagged when they land in Britain, we can reveal. The tough new measure aims to crack down on black market work and deter people from making the dangerous crossing. It is being drawn up as ministers have privately accepted there is no short-term fix to the influx of small boats. Economic migrants and asylum seekers of working age would be electronically tagged and subject to restrictions on their movements while their applications to stay in Britain are processed. Plans being drawn up between the Home Office and a new Cabinet Office taskforce to tackle the issue are also looking at the possibility of curfews. It is thought that more than a million illegal immigrants are currently working in Britain, meaning many more prefer to come here rather than stay in the EU where ID cards are required for jobs. Last month France's interior minister Gerald Darmanin said that Britain must ""limit its economic attractiveness"". He insisted Paris would not be ""held hostage"" and called for a clampdown on illegal workers in the UK. He previously suggested migrants are ""attracted by England, especially the labour market which means you can work in England without any identification"". Yesterday a Home Office source said the proposal was ""a low cost, high impact way to make changes quickly"". The source said the tag plan was ""in part to stop the pull factor, and part to stop people absconding while their claims to stay are being processed"". They added: ""Illegal entry isn't a punishment-free crime. Tagging will make it quicker and easier to deport those who have no right to be here."" It has been a record year for small boat crossings. More than 27,000 people have so far reached the UK from France compared to around 8,000 last year. On Monday, authorities rescued or intercepted 82 people on three boats while the French stopped 86 on four boats. Another 82 tried to cross on Tuesday and more than 100 yesterday. Tom Pursglove, minister for tackling illegal migration, said: ""The Nationality and Borders Bill will make it a criminal offence to knowingly arrive in the UK illegally and introduce life sentences for those who facilitate illegal entry.""",Real Sun,367.0
1,Real,The Sun,"PM Boris Johnson has been warned he is drinking in the last-chance saloon after his party's huge by-election defeat. The Conservatives lost the once ultra-safe seat of North Shropshire for the first time in 200 years in the wake of sleaze scandals and Christmas party rows. Jubilant Liberal Democrats wiped out the 23,000 majority to seize the seat with their own 6,000 margin after it was vacated by the disgraced ex-Cabinet Minister Owen Paterson. Lib Dem candidate Helen Morgan took the seat with 17,957 votes, pushing Tory Neil Shastri-Hurst into second place on 12,032 — with a 34 per cent swing against him. That is the fourth largest swing in a by-election in the past 30 years. The Tories' thumping was the seventh biggest upset in a by-election since World War Two. But the Prime Minister took ""full responsibility"" for the defeat and vowed to kick-start his faltering Downing Street operation after weeks of torrid headlines and scandals. He acknowledged he needed to fix the anger over No10 parties and the controversy of his Downing Street refurbishment. But he insisted a ""constant litany of stuff about politics and politicians"" had overshadowed the Government's successes, such as the rapid roll-out of the Covid booster jab campaign. He told reporters: ""I've got to put my hands up and say, 'Have I failed to get that message across in the last few weeks? Has it been obscured by all this other stuff?' Yes, I'm afraid it has."" But last night Mr Johnson's Tory enemies spoke out to declare he was one strike away from being ousted. Devout Remainer Sir Roger Gale said: ""I think this has to be seen as a referendum on the Prime Minister's performance — and I think that the Prime Minister is now in last orders time."" The Kent MP added: ""One more strike and he's out."" Sir Charles Walker, vice-chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, said a leadership contest would be completely self-indulgent — but added Mr Johnson had a year at most to make a difference. He told Times Radio: ""The Prime Minister has got weeks, months, a year to sort himself out. If we go on making unforced errors over the next three to six months or nine months, it will become a lot more serious. It's serious now, but it's not at a critical level yet."" Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the treasurer of the 1922 Committee, said it was not the time for a ""big blame game"" but that Mr Johnson needed to stop the ""self-inflicted own goals"". However, it was not just the old guard who were calling for Mr Johnson to get a grip. North West Durham MP Richard Holden — who sensationally won the mining community for the Tories in 2019 — warned support for Mr Johnson was not unconditional. Boris faces a tough few months, with the soaring cost of living, threat of future Covid restrictions and biting tax rises next April. The PM's allies are braced for a leadership crisis after potentially painful local elections in May. The Tories hit a historic high in council seats last fought in 2019 under then PM Theresa May. But they risk of losing thousands of council seats next spring at a time described as the ""moment of maximum danger"" for the PM. This has to be seen as a referendum on the Prime Minister's performance — and I think that the Prime Minister is now in last orders time. Last night, ex-Scottish Tory leader Baroness Ruth Davidson — a long standing critic of the PM — said he was drinking in the last chance saloon and had been ""put on warning by his MPs"". She said the party was looking for him to sharpen the operation at No10. And she warned it was time ""for a bit of bloody grip to be exerted"" if he wanted to stay in Downing Street.",Real Sun,649.0
2,Real,The Sun,"DOWNING Street's probe into Christmas lockdown breaking collapsed into farce last night as the chief inquisitor QUIT after it emerged his own staff had a party last December. Cabinet Secretary Simon Case stepped down from investigating the slew of allegations that No10 staff flouted lockdown rules by boozing and playing party games last Christmas. Boris Johnson had tasked Whitehall's most senior civil servant to look into the claims, but last night they were hit by fresh allegations that Mr Case's own team had flouted Tier 3 rules last year. The Cabinet Office admitted that six members of his team had bought booze and snacks into the office on 17 December 2020 and took part in a virtual quiz with other colleagues from their desk. Email invites were sent in advance called it ""Christmas party!"" - coming the night before Mr Johnson's own team were accused of a boozy wine and cheese knees-up. Mr Case admitted he was aware of the social gathering that Labour claims appears to have broken the strict rules against social gatherings in place in London at the time. But the top mandarin denied other claims that a bigger party had taken place in his vast suite of offices in the heart of Whitehall. Last week Boris Johnson had tasked Mr Case with probing claims No10 staff had broken the rules. When asked if the Cabinet Secretary had been at any social gatherings, the PM's spokesman insisted: ""You can be assured due diligence will have been observed."" Last night one top minister branded the latest twist in the saga ""f***ing amateur hour."" Whitehall's former top sleazebuster Sue Gray was last night drafted in to take over the probe. The official served as head of the Government's ethics team for five years and has a fearsome reputation as a no-nonsense street-fighter. A statement said: ""To ensure the ongoing investigation retains public confidence the Cabinet Secretary has recused himself for the remainder of the process."" Labour said there was ""growing evidence of a culture of turning a blind eye to the rules.""",Real Sun,343.0
3,Real,The Sun,"MISERABLE Whitehall officials have drawn up plans to restrict numbers in pubs and restaurants and even close them down in the coming weeks. There are growing fears of further restrictions after Christmas as Omicron is expected to peak in January, with New Year parties in grave doubt. A government source said: ""You will be able to see your family at Christmas, but at this rate, you might not be able to do it in a pub. ""As for New Year's Eve, that is a different story."" But MPs privately warn they will torpedo any attempts to bring in former restrictions like the Rule of Six or a ban on household mixing. Health Secretary Sajid Javid insisted there were ""no plans"" for any more measures, as the Omicron variant was poised to become the dominant strain of Covid in London and it claimed its first victim. More than one in five Tory MPs will vote against Boris Johnson tomorrow night as a brutal rebellion on vaccine passports hit 80. One ex-minister told The Sun that Tuesday night's vote is a ""show of force"". No10 vowed to crack on with the vote despite the PM's majority being wiped out - amid dire warnings of a bigger backlash at any attempt at ""Plan C"" restrictions. But Covid certification for nightclubs, mega-bars and stadiums is expected to sail through the Commons with the backing of Sir Keir Starmer's Labour. Yet Mr Johnson sparked further Tory jitters by refusing to say three times that there will not be further measures introduced before Christmas. Deputy PM Dominic Raab today insisted Brits will be able to ""enjoy"" the festive period with their families but also wouldn't rule out new restrictions. Asked about the possibility of new curbs on pubs and restaurants such as capacity limits, he admitted: ""These issues are always discussed. But he added: ""We have got Plan B, that's what we think is required over the Christmas period. ""I think people can look forward to spending Christmas with loved ones in a way that we couldn't last year."" Mr Raab also defended vaccine passports saying fears about them have been ""overstated"" and they're not the start of a ""slippery slope"" of restrictions. He said that he would be ""very surprised"" if 80 Tory MPs rebel against No 10 over their introduction in tonight's crunch vote. The number expected to rebel in the Commons far outweighs the 56 MPs required to trigger an internal confidence vote in the PM - but falls short of the 181 needed to defeat him. A senior MP said: ""They may be able to get stuff through on Labour votes, but if they push things too far I have no doubt it would be curtains."" Meanwhile leading Tory rebel Marcus Fysh was slammed after comparing the planned coronavirus health passes being introduced to limit the spread of Omicron to atrocities in Nazi Germany. The Board of Deputies of British Jews called his remarks ""completely unacceptable"". Mr Fysh argued that the passes, which can be acquired by being fully vaccinated or receiving a negative lateral flow result, would be ""segregating society based on an unacceptable thing"". ""We are not a 'papers please' society. This is not Nazi Germany,"" he said. ""It's the thin end of an authoritarian wedge and that's why we will resist it."" Despite his opposition to being a ""papers please"" society, Mr Fysh voted in September for the Government's Elections Bill which will introduce photographic identification for voting.",Real Sun,579.0
4,Real,The Sun,"BORIS Johnson is facing a growing Tory mutiny as the party's newbies unite with old guard MPs to warn the PM to ""get a grip"". Five MPs from the 2019 intake are now thought to have written letters to demand Mr Johnson quits. It comes after a torrid week for the PM, engulfed in Christmas Party fury and the ongoing wallpaper-gate saga. Yesterday, Mr Johnson was in frantic talks with his anti-sleaze adviser, who demanded evidence to explain discrepancies in the PM's story about the No 10 flat redecoration. Lord Geidt, the PM's independent adviser on standards, probed the spruce-up earlier this year. But new evidence has emerged that Mr Johnson may have known the true source of decorating donations earlier than he claimed. Lord Geidt is said to be ""furious and humiliated"". And last night he was understood to be considering relaunching the probe. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson's senior spin doctor, Jack Doyle, offered to resign over the ongoing row after last year's lockdown-breaking wine and cheese event for No 10 staff. Adviser Allegra Stratton has already quit over the do after a mocking video was leaked. It comes as the PM's personal rating fell by 11 points in less than a month — with YouGov finding his approval score at a new low of -41. MPs have been spotted going to see backbench boss Sir Graham Brady to demand a leadership election. Last week The Sun reported as many as a dozen Tory MPs want a change of leader, still far short of the 56 required to formally trigger a contest. But one angry minister hit back at the Tory newbies, saying: ""It doesn't take long before these kids forget who got them their seat."" Ex-Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell has urged the PM to get a grip to keep his job. He told Times Radio: ""I hope he will still be Prime Minister in a year — but if Downing Street don't get a grip and start to deliver the governance many of my colleagues are talking about openly, then the PM will be in considerable trouble.""",Real Sun,347.0
5,Real,The Sun,"WHITEHALL's top anti-sleaze boss has demanded new evidence to explain ""discrepancies"" in Boris Johnson about the Downing Street flat redecoration. Lord Geidt, the PM's independent adviser on standards, probed the flat-gate scandal earlier this year - but now Mr Johnson has been accused of lying about when he knew the true source of decorating donations. The former Buckingham Palace aide is said to be furious and humiliated and has demanded No10 comes up with answers quickly as he considers REOPENING his probe into the saga. Yesterday the Tories were fined thousands of pounds for breaking donation rules over the No11 flat renovations. In an unexpected bodyblow in a week of chaos for the PM, the Electoral Commission rapped them for failing to report how cash was spent on Boris and Carrie's gold £112,549 wallpaper flat renovations. The watchdog said the Tories had failed to ""accurately report a donation and keep a proper accounting record"" of the money handed over by Tory peer Lord Brownlow in October 2020. The PM borrowed more than £52,000 for the refurb, paid for via a party loan from Lord Brownlow. Earlier this year the PM said he had no idea who was behind the cash for it, but yesterday's watchdog report revealed he Whatsapped the peer asking for more cash to help redo the flat where he lives with his wife Carrie and two kids. No10 said he was asking for extra cash for the Downing Street trust, but that he had no idea where the money was coming from. They insisted Mr Johnson had been honest and followed the rules ""at all times"", denying he had lied to his standards chief over what he knew. In May, his independent adviser on standards, Lord Geidt, cleared him of a conflict of interest. Labour's Angela Rayner accused the PM of outright lying in his testimony to the standards chief. She raged: ""The Prime Minister must now explain why he lied to the British public saying he didn't know who was behind No 11 flat refurb - all the while he was WhatsApping the donor asking for more money. ""Boris Johnson has taken the British public for fools. He's not only broken the law but made a mockery of the standards we expect from our prime ministers."" Mr Johnson hit back last night, saying voters can kick him out at the next election if they don't like him. He told an event: ""They have every right to cast us down and out again.""",Real Sun,414.0
6,Real,The Sun,"BORIS Johnson imposed dramatic Plan B virus rules yesterday — as the Tories faced a backlash over last year's No10 Christmas party. The Grinch PM was accused of ""one rule for them, one for us"". Senior Tory Mark Harper fumed: ""Why should people listen to his instructions to follow the rules when people inside Number 10 Downing Street don't do so?"" The PM told Brits to work from home again if they can and wear masks at most indoor public venues, while ordering vaccine passports and contact testing for Omicron. He apologised for the 2020 lockdown-breaking party, and top aide Allegra Stratton quit in tears after footage showed her joking with staff over the bash. Speaking at Downing Street, the PM said he had no choice but to impose new curbs. Statistics now show 568 Brits infected with Omicron, but scientists say 10,000 have the bug. Gloomy ministers believe infection rates will soar to one million by the end of the month. Tories slammed the ""tyrannical"" measures and said fed-up Brits cannot be expected to stick to rules when Downing Street staff do not. MP Greg Smith said: ""We are being encouraged to go to (our own) Christmas parties while being told to avoid the office at all costs. These rules are absurdly baffling to even the most authoritarian lockdown supporter."" Privately Tory MPs accused the PM of rushing the Plan B decision to distract from the row over the No10 party. One said: ""It is ridiculous. It is no way to run a country."" MPs claimed Mr Johnson had undermined the rollout of his Plan B restrictions by wrecking public confidence in Covid rules. But he insisted he knew nothing of last year's bash at No 10 and launched an internal inquiry into whether aides and civil servants had broken the law with their cheese and wine bash. Despite complaints from Labour MPs, the Met Police last night said they would not investigate the alleged breach of rules due to an ""absence of evidence"". Earlier Mr Johnson told MPs he was furious about leaked footage showing aides laughing and discussing the 2020 soiree on December 18 when London was under Tier 3 measures. Ms Stratton, 41, was filmed taking part in a mock press conference in preparation for televised briefings when she joked about the event. But yesterday in a tearful statement, she offered her ""profound apologies"" and said she will ""regret those remarks for the rest of my days"". Mr Johnson has been dogged for a week by questions over staff breaking lockdown rules, but he has repeatedly insisted he had been assured no rules were broken. Yet after the bombshell video leak, he finally admitted he had based his position on assurances from ""respected civil servants and special advisers"". Mr Johnson then asked Cabinet Secretary Simon Case ""to establish all the facts and to report back as soon as possible"". The PM added: ""It goes without saying that if those rules were broken, then there will be disciplinary action for all those involved. ""I understand and share the anger up and down the country at seeing No 10 staff seeming to make light of lockdown measures because I was also furious to see that clip. ""I apologise unreservedly for the offence that it has caused."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the PM's apology ""raises more questions than answers"" as he had been ""caught red-handed"".

10,Real,The Sun,"BORIS Johnson has been warned Sinn Fein will sweep to power in Northern Ireland and break up the UK if he does not fix the row over Brexit border checks. DUP heavyweight Ian Paisley Jr says further delay will only ""embolden republicans in Northern Ireland and those who want to rip us out of the United Kingdom."" Britain is at loggerheads with Brussels over the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol that forces checks on goods travelling from the mainland to Ulster. Mr Johnson has threatened to trigger the emergency Article 16 break clause to suspend the rules claiming they are crippling trade - but is locked in talks with the EU to try avoid having to do so. But Mr Paisley, MP for North Antrim, has warned time is running out to come good on that threat - or risk nationalists romping to victory in next year's elections in the province. The unionist big wig told The Sun that Mr Johnson risks going down in history as as a terrible PM's if he goes soft on his tough talk. Amid growing Cabinet concerns that the PM has ""gone wobbly"", Mr Paisley says Sinn Fein are on the march and risk seizing control of Stormont if the standoff continues much longer - opening the door to years of wrangling over Irish unification. He hit out: ""This is a do or die moment for the Prime Minister. The past 12 months have cost Northern Ireland dearly. ""Triggering Article 16 is long overdue. It is a legitimate and proportionate response to the failed Protocol that has disrupted internal UK trade, inflated internal UK costs, created political unrest and tensions here are festering. ""So long as Boris Johnson sticks by this failing status quo, he will only embolden republicans in Northern Ireland and those who want to rip us out of the United Kingdom. ""Let's be clear PM if this situation continues unchanged Sinn Fein are in poll position to capitalise electorally. ""And they will be given a platform to demand Ulster's removal from the Union.

""Take back control of the entire United Kingdom or history will not be kind to your stewardship of the Union."" Yesterday Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he is an ""optimist"" when it comes to the prospect of a deal with the EU on the Protocol, but triggering Article 16 is still on the table as ""substantive gaps"" remain between the two sides. He struck a hopeful tone after Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said on Wednesday that reaching an agreement on the protocol before Christmas was ""unrealistic"". Brexit minister Lord Frost previously said both the UK and the EU wanted the dispute ""settled one way or the other"" before the winter. A government spokesman said: ""The bottom line is that the EU's proposals don't go far enough to address the real problems facing people in Northern Ireland because of the Protocol. ""We're clear we'd rather agree solutions, but if we can't we'll have to use the safeguard provisions in the Protocol to preserve stability in Northern Ireland instead.

11,Real,The Sun,"LIZ Truss did a Margaret Thatcher yesterday — and climbed aboard a British tank to warn Russia against invasion plans. The Foreign Secretary said President Vladimir Putin would be making a strategic mistake if he took military action to extend his territory. Wearing a helmet and armoured vest, Ms Truss was just miles from the Russian border as she declared: ""We will stand with our fellow democracies against Russia's malign activity."" And she vowed Nato would safeguard the security of Ukraine amid growing fears Putin will annexe the neighbour state. Mrs Thatcher revived her Iron Lady status in 1986 by riding on a Challenger tank at a Nato training camp in Germany — wearing goggles and a headscarf.

In the second rejig this year, ex-Labour minister Yvette Cooper returned to the front bench. As Shadow Home Secretary, she is tasked with tackling Priti Patel over migrants and crime. And former Labour leader Ed Miliband was stripped of his business brief after angering Sir Keir on demands to nationalise energy. Leadership contender Lisa Nandy will go head to head with Michael Gove on levelling up in a demotion from the Shadow Foreign Secretary job. Rising stars Wes Streeting and Bridget Phillipson were handed the key roles at Health and Education. Emily Thornberry was demoted to Shadow Attorney General. And the reshuffle was a humiliating blow to Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner, who has made several digs at Sir Keir over recent weeks. Yesterday morning she was on the radio denying Sir Keir would conduct a reshuffle — just two hours before the Labour leader began one. She told Times Radio: ""No, I'm not aware of any plans for a reshuffle. I reckon that Keir would tell me first, yeah."" Last night Sir Keir said: ""We are a smaller, more focused Shadow Cabinet.""",Real Sun,204.0
13,Real,The Sun,"ANGELA Rayner was left humiliated today after denying Sir Keir Starmer would conduct a reshuffle just two hours before the Labour leader started moving frontbenchers. The deputy leader told a radio interview that the party was more focussed on big issues and holding the government's feet to the fire rather than discussing ""internal jobs"". But at the same time the Labour leader was beginning to shift around his top team for the second time this year - blindsiding his number 2. Sir Keir's first attempt last May went off half cocked with a doomed attempt to demote Ms Rayner ended up with the deputy leader getting a slew of promotions after she refused to be side-lined. And today's effort appears to be equally calamitous. Ahead of a big speech about sleaze, Ms Rayner told Times Radio just after 8 o'clock this morning: ""No, I'm not aware of any plans for a reshuffle. I haven't been consulted, so I don't think there's any, you know, focus on that at the moment… ""We've been holding the government to account and that's what we're focusing on at the moment, not internal what job you've got."" Embarrassingly she added: ""I reckon that Keir would tell me first yeah."" But behind the scenes Sir Keir had spent the morning calling Shadow Cabinet ministers about their future jobs. At 11.30am, Ms Rayner again told reporters ""I've been concentrating on the job that I'm doing"" and again said she was not aware of a reshuffle. But her spokesman later clarified that Sir Keir had called Ms Rayner to inform her of a reshuffle ""in the future"" but not that it was today, or any of the details. However moments later Labour frontbencher Cat Smith announced that she was quitting the Shadow Cabinet - and revealed Sir Keir was already conducting a reshuffle. Ms Smith was a key member of Ms Rayner's team posing questions on how informed the Labour deputy really was on the planned changes.

14,Real,The Sun,"HEALTH chiefs last night confirmed a third case of the new Omicron Covid strain in the UK — amid fears there are already hundreds of others. More than 75 ""probable"" cases of the mutant variant have been flagged with more than 150 possible others, according to Government sources. Ministers and scientists are scrambling to work out how contagious and dangerous Omicron is. It is feared to spread more rapidly. But one doctor in South Africa, where it was identified 12 days ago, reported its symptoms as ""mild"". Meanwhile, the UK Health Security Agency warned it was ""very likely"" further Omicron cases will be discovered in the coming days. Last night there were extensive contact tracing efforts in Westminster after it emerged the latest confirmed case had visited before leaving the UK. But Health Secretary Sajid Javid dismissed calls for a further lockdown. He said infections and hospitalisations were ""nowhere near"" the level required for restrictions beyond those announced by Boris Johnson at Saturday's surprise press conference. Mr Javid said the tighter restrictions on the border and masks for Christmas shoppers and commuters are needed to ""buy time"" to work out how bad the new variant is and whether it blunts the effectiveness of vaccines. Last night it was confirmed: But Mr Javid insisted these restrictions would not spoil festivities and urged Brits to ""keep making plans to see family and friends"" — just like he is doing. He said: ""I think people should continue with their plans as normal for Christmas. I think it's going to be a great Christmas."" But he warned it would be ""irresponsible"" to guarantee that further restrictions would not be needed. He told Times Radio: ""We've been very open with the information we have. We just don't know enough yet to make definitive conclusions. ""But if we can buy some time to stop it from being seeded quickly or to stop its spread — then we can use that sensibly to assess it more and get answers to all these vital questions."" Teams of AstraZeneca scientists are ""confident"" that they will defeat the latest Covid variant - as they conduct tests in hotspots so that the company's Vaxzervria jab can be tweaked quickly if necessary. The scientists remained upbeat about their ability to adapt their vaccine if needed to battle the new mutation. A spokeswoman told the Daily Express: ""We are looking into the Omicron variant to understand more about it and the impact on the vaccine. ""AstraZeneca has developed, in collaboration with Oxford University, a vaccine platform that enables us to respond quickly to new variants. ""AZ is also already conducting research in locations where the variant has been identified, that will enable us to collect real-world data."" Despite reassurances, vaccine task force boss Sir John Bell warned that it was too late to stop ""the monster"" from reaching the UK — and it would only be a ""matter of time"" before infections rocket. But he confirmed a ""tweak"" to existing coronavirus jabs could be done and Britain was well-placed to do so thanks to the Oxford/AstraZeneca team. Labour last night demanded workers be sent home from offices, and even tighter rules on masks and borders. Frontbencher Lisa Nandy hit out: ""There are a number of outstanding holes in our defences"" around travel. She warned: ""We don't think the Government has been getting the balance right up to now. ""That's why we support the measures to bring in greater use of masks, mandatory masks in some settings. ""And we'll be asking questions about whether the scientific basis for that suggests that that needs to go further."" A handful of head teachers even urged schools to close early for the Christmas holidays and there were calls for a return to hated social distancing. But Mr Javid rejected the moves. He told Sky News: ""We know now those types of measures do carry a very heavy price, both economically, socially, in terms of non-Covid health outcomes such as impact on mental health. ""So if one was to make decisions like that, they would have to be done very, very carefully and we're not there yet — we're nowhere near that."" Yesterday 37,681 Covid cases were confirmed, with 51 deaths. The number of patients going into hospital was 11 per cent down on last week. A DOCTOR who treated Omicron patients says symptoms are mild but unusual — including high heart rate. Dr Angelique Coetzee, who runs a private clinic in Pretoria, South Africa, said it did not cause loss of taste or smell like previous variants. She said cases were not serious but added: ""We have to worry about older, unvaccinated people. ""If they are not vaccinated, we are going to see many with a severe form of the disease."" The Omicron strain may also be able to avoid vaccines, experts fear. A VEGAN who refused a Covid jab in a stand against animal testing has died from the virus. Glynn Steel, 54, lost his fight for life after two weeks in intensive care. His wife Emma, 50, said his last words were: ""I have never felt so ill. I wish I'd had the vaccine.""",Real Sun,859.0
15,Real,The Sun,"TENSIONS between Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson's boiled over during Budget talks, The Sun can reveal. The Chancellor demanded the PM's aides leave the room for a ""reality check chat"" as he raged over huge spending promises. Allies deny claims that Mr Sunak threatened to resign. A government source said: ""Things got very bad in the run up to the spending review when No10 just kept saying more, more. It boiled over eventually and they had a long chat just the two of them."" Other Downing Street insiders confirmed the showdown in mid-October. Yesterday the Times reported that Mr Sunak's allies have grown frustrated with the chaotic nature of the No10 operation in another round of stinging briefings.

Mr Sunak's enforcer has been accused of briefing against the PM previously, but last night the Chancellor was standing by his man.

In a rowdy session of Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson was cheered by Tory MPs as he rejected claims he was not fit for office. Sir Keir Starmer highlighted Tory divisions over Mr Johnson's style and rumours of a rift with Mr Sunak. The Labour boss hit out: ""The Prime Minister's routine is falling flat. ""His Chancellor is worried that people are getting wise, his backbenchers say it's embarrassing... and senior people in Downing Street tell the BBC 'it's just not working'.""

He insisted: ""The migrant crisis hasn't even started — the numbers are only going to go up and up and up."" Mr Farage said he was being begged by donors and voters to make a return — and he was giving it serious thought. He warned ministers that voters and Tory members were losing faith in the Government. Mr Farage said: ""This was meant to be an era of hope, this was meant to be Brexit Britain. It's not just migrants, it's Net Zero and taxes, too.""

19,Real,The Sun,"SENIOR ministers and Royals are set to snub the Beijing Winter Olympics in a dramatic hardening in Britain's stance towards China. Boris Johnson last week called together the National Security Council to hammer out policy on the superpower, The Sun can reveal. Following the long session, the PM said China was never going to ""evolve towards"" being a free-market democracy and ""we should be clear-eyed about that"". There has also been grave concern this week over the fate of missing Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai, who criticised the regime. Royals and ministers are under pressure not to attend the February Games in protest. Downing Street sources insist no decision has been made — and there is the added complication that Princess Anne sits on the Olympics governing body. But Cabinet sources suggest a snub is on the cards. One said: ""We won't be going with bells and whistles, perhaps sending a very junior minister at most."" Other sources suggest a broader snub is the cards although would perhaps not be announced publicly. There are claims that while some in Mr Johnson's team such as Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and Deputy PM Dominic Raab are pushing for a major snub, they have been met by resistance so far from Mr Johnson. Security chiefs warned the PM relations with the Beijing regime will never recover from Covid lies, dire human rights abuses and escalating espionage attacks. Speaking in Washington DC yesterday, Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ""We in the UK will no longer tolerate the brazen way we have seen our national security subject to attacks.

Ministers are already plotting to raise the legal age to wed from 16 to 18 by removing parental consent. But a new clause will clamp down on arranged marriages by making it a specific crime for children, The Sun can reveal. The Government will throw their weight behind Pauline Latham's Private Member's Bill today in a victory for campaigners who say the law isn't tough enough to stop abusive parents from taking advantage of their kids. The bill will expand the definition of forced marriage so it's illegal to arrange the marriage of anyone under 18, even if the child consents to it. Throwing his weight behind the calls, Deputy Prime Minister, Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, Dominic Raab said last night: ""Forced child marriage ruins lives. ""We back this Bill to keep vulnerable young people safe, by raising the legal age of marriage to 18, and closing gaps in the law which leave them at risk.""

He also urged the bloc to end its reliance on Russia for gas supplies. He said leaders came together for last week's COP26 summit helped ""by collective embarrassment at the way internationalism failed during Covid"". Blasting the French, the PM hit out at ""crazy decisions of some countries to try to stop the export of vaccines to others"".

22,Real,The Sun,"TORY party chiefs were locked in a Bonfire Night war of words as fireworks flew over who was to blame for the disastrous Owen Paterson U-turn. Boris Johnson and his Chief Whip Mark Spencer, as well as Commons leader Jacob Rees Mogg, were all slammed by MPs and ministers over the sleaze saga. Yesterday the disgraced MP formally quit the Commons paving the way for a testy by-election in North Shropshire. But back in Westminster class war erupted, with the 2019 intake of Tory MPs said to be particularly angry at being ordered through the division lobbies to try to delay Mr Paterson's 30 day suspension over breaching lobbying rules. One said: ""All the toffs versus towns stuff is back. The 2019 intake is very different from the country-gent old guard, and we find it very patronising when told what to do by them."" Tensions peaked on Wednesday night with one newbie MP calling the embattled Mr Paterson a four letter word to his face. And there were bitter blows traded at the very top of Government after allies of the ex-Cabinet Minister said the doomed amendment to re-model Commons rules was written ""at the heart of No10"". In a day of claim and counterclaim, Downing Street sources rejected that and instead pointed the finger of blame at Jacob Rees Mogg for conjuring up the plan. But the Commons leader's allies insisted he had the full support and blessing of Mr Johnson to try find a way to save Mr Paterson - saying he ""served only at the Prime Minister's pleasure."" However anger boiled over, with one minister branding Mr Rees-Mogg's amendment ""fatally flawed"" as opposition parties immediately refused to cooperate. They told The Sun: ""Just because you can speak Latin and know your Tudor history it doesn't make you some master strategist."" And there was anger aimed at Chief Whip Mark Spencer for ""overselling the level of support Paterson had in the party"" and pressurising the PM to back the extraordinary effort to save the doomed ex-Cabinet Minister.

23,Real,The Sun,"BORIS Johnson was last night reeling from his most painful U-turn yet — with all sides of his party turning fire on No10. Comparisons were drawn with last year's debacle over free school meals pitting ministers against footie star Marcus Rashford. It was followed by doomed attempts to save then Health Secretary Matt Hancock and dithering over lockdowns. Mr Johnson is known for his desire not to throw colleagues to the wolves or bow to media pressure. But his aborted bid to save pal Owen Paterson risks being his most damaging climbdown so far. The PM is left with a Tory Party once again at war with itself and Labour cries of ""one rule for them"" starting to land a blow. Paterson allies feel bruised No10 withdrew its support. And serving ministers have been made to look like fools by following orders against their better judgment — none more than Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng. He was out on the airwaves still defending a tawdry effort to bypass Common's sleaze busters to save Mr Paterson while the No10 team were bunkered down plotting the about-turn yesterday morning. The Sun can reveal the divisions have reached the core of Mr Johnson's closest team who were deeply divided over saving Mr Paterson. While Chief Whip Mark Spencer and some political aides convinced the PM he could get away with the stunt, spin doctors and Chief of Staff Dan Rosenfeld were begging him not to do it. Mr Johnson, in Italy for the G20 and Glasgow for COP26, returned to a plan his Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg, a close pal of Paterson, assured him was watertight. Sympathetic to the tragedy of Mr Paterson's wife's suicide, the PM sided with the Brexiteer, a decision he must now sorely regret. But it is not the first time Mr Johnson has got it badly wrong when it comes to protecting allies. He came to rue standing by controversial aide Dominic Cummings over breaking lockdown rules — only to be punished when the adviser went rogue. Mr Cummings yesterday repeated his charge that the PM is a ""broken shopping trolley"" veering out of control.

24,Real,The Sun,"RISHI Sunak today confirmed the public sector pay freeze is over for millions of workers and those on the minimum wage will have their pay hiked by £1,000 a year. As The Sun revealed on Monday, up to five million public sector workers like police, soldiers and teachers will get a pay rise for the first time in two years. Exactly how much will be negotiated by sector Pay Review Bodies, but last night nurses again threatened strike action over their 3 per cent offer. But the Chancellor said the stronger than expected recovery from Covid meant it was time to relax the squeeze put on pay during the pandemic - as he also confirmed the new Minimum Wage would be £9.50 an hour. Mr Sunak said: ""The economic impact and uncertainty of the virus meant we had to take the difficult decision to pause public sector pay. ""Now, with the economy firmly back on track, it's right that nurses, teachers and all the other public sector workers who played their part during the pandemic see their wages rise."" Yesterday the Chancellor accepted in full the recommendation of the Low Pay Commission to hike the pay of the lowest-paid workers from £8.91 to £9.50 an hour – an extra £1000 a year for a full-time worker. From 1 April, young people and apprentices will also see their wages boosted as the National Minimum Wage for people aged 21-22 goes up to £9.18 an hour and Apprentice Rate increases to £4.81 an hour.",Real Sun,252.0
25,Real,The Sun,"RECORD petrol prices have forced Chancellor Rishi Sunak to ditch a 2.84p budget hike in fuel duty — a win for The Sun's Keep It Down campaign. The average forecourt price per litre hit a record 142.94p on Sunday, with soaring oil prices and retailers blamed for hiking prices. The hated levy was due to go up from 57.95p per litre to 60.79p — potentially costing drivers £66 extra a year per car. But MPs say they have been privately assured by the Treasury that the scheduled 4.9 per cent rise for 2022 will not go ahead. In a major victory for The Sun's ""Keep It Down"" Campaign, the duty will be frozen for the second time this year. Chancellor Rishi Sunak was forced to abandon the planned hike in tomorrow's Budget after petrol prices hit a record high. The average forecourt price per litre hit 142.94p on Sunday, with soaring oil prices and retailers blamed for putting up prices. Yesterday the PM's official spokesman also dropped a massive hint of the move, saying: ""We recognise rising fuel costs are a challenge for the British public."" He urged fuel providers to make sure they put drivers before profits, saying: ""We would always want to see providers ensure they are providing good value to customers."" The RAC said retailers have increased their profit margins by 4p a litre, from around 5.5p in April last year to 8.59p. They claimed smaller, independent ones were trying to rebuild profits after the steep fall in sales prompted by the first UK lockdown last year. But they also say the increase was partly due to a doubling of the oil price since last year. Brent Crude, the international benchmark, now stands at more than $86 a barrel. Some analysts believe the oil price could rise further. This is due to high demand as economies recover from the Covid pandemic — and the Opec-Plus group of oil producing countries not increasing supply. The AA said: ""Whether it's down to oil producers, market speculators, Treasury taxes or struggling retailers trying to balance their margins, record pump prices must be saying to drivers with the means it's time to make the switch to electric."" Its fuel price spokesman Luke Bosdet added: ""As for poorer motorists — many of them now facing daily charges to drive in cities — there is no escape. It's a return to cutting back on other consumer spending, perhaps even heating or food, to keep the car that gets them to work on the road."" The Chancellor has been under huge political pressure not to raise fuel duty. Dozens of MPs from Northern Tory pressure group the NRG wrote to him saying: ""Those in the North rely on cars to go to work, to take their children to school, and to put food on the table. ""Any rise in fuel duty puts a barrier in the way of people accessing well-paying jobs and taking care of their families. Cars for our constituents aren't a luxury Chancellor, they are a necessity."" Last night campaigners urged Mr Sunak to go further and cut the tax. Howard Cox of FairFuelUK said: ""The last 12 months of eye-watering pump prices, seriously made worse by opportunistic fuel supply chain wholesalers, has given the Exchequer an unforeseen VAT windfall of more than £1billion: the equivalent of 3p of fuel duty."" He said the Chancellor could use the extra VAT to reduce the duty. Drivers across the country have voiced fury over the rise in fuel prices. Victoria Bartlett, 49, of Thornhill, Hants, said: ""The prices are ridiculous. ""I have to go to have cancer treatment once a week but every three weeks it's twice a week. I have to be able to do that and my usual errands on £15 a week. If the prices go up any more, I don't know what I'll do."" Lana Fisher, 52, a carer from Southampton, added: ""It feels like a rip off — 140.9p a litre and this is the cheapest one around here."" Dean Cooper, 42, from Croydon, South London said: ""It's ridiculous. It's £1.39 for the cheapest. I'm a dad of eight kids. It's impacting everything. ""It affects day-to-day life. You go abroad, you spend £50 and you fill up a big V8 (engine). Here, £50 wouldn't even fill up a Mini. ""No fuel, no movement. The price of fuel on a low income is dreadful."" WHAT has caused the rise? Key is the jump in the cost of oil, which has doubled from around $40 a barrel a year ago to $85 now. Demand has soared as lockdowns ended. Are forecourts increasing profits too? Yes they are — taking 7.5p per litre, 2p more than at the start of lockdowns. They argue they are making up for lost earnings during lockdowns when demand for unleaded and diesel slumped. What about E10? The new greener fuel uses 10 per cent ethanol rather then five. Since ethanol is more expensive than petrol, it added around a penny a litre to pump prices. Will prices go up after the Budget? Hopefully not.

27,Real,The Sun,"NEARLY five million Brits will get salary rises as Rishi Sunak unfreezes public sector pay and hikes the national minimum wage. The Chancellor put the squeeze last year on 2.6 million teachers, civil servants and police officers' wages because of Covid. But he will use his Budget this Wednesday to end that pain. And Mr Sunak is expected to hike the minimum wage from £8.91 — with some sources suggesting it could go up to as much as £9.45. That would give the two million or so on rock-bottom figure a £1,000 annual increase for a 35-hour week from next year. The potential five per cent rise comes just weeks after Boris Johnson said Brits deserved to be paid more. And it puts the national minimum wage well on target to hit £10 by the time of the next general election, scheduled for 2024. Currently, Brits aged 23 and over are entitled to be paid a minimum of £8.91 per hour, with a lower sum of £8.36 for 21 and 22-year-olds. The rates are set on advice from the Low Pay Commission, which is due to make their recommendations to Mr Sunak today. The independent expert body has previously hinted a big rise for 2022 is coming but there is concern in the Treasury about the impact on small businesses. The PM told the Conservative Party conference in Manchester this month: ""We are not going back to the same old broken model with low wages, low growth, low skills and low productivity."" And he urged businesses to put up wages. But senior Tories are very aware such a plea would need to be matched by the Government giving support. Shops and hauliers have already been forced to hike wages in an attempt to fill worker shortages. Sainsbury's and Morrisons are both offering above minimum wage as the supermarkets look to hire thousands of Christmas temps. And aspiring lorry drivers have been offered £1,000 joining bonuses and higher wages as firms struggle with the HGV driver shortfall. Mr Sunk, asked if pay was going up, yesterday said: ""We will have to set a new pay policy and that will be a topic for the spending review."" Firms in plea for tax cuts

A £6billion package of funding to help tackle NHS backlogs across England will form a major plank of Wednesday's Budget. And there will be £5billion for cutting edge research and development. The catch up cash will go toward new mobile testing, checks and scan sites for a range of problems - with these appointments currently making up the vast majority of the Covid backlog. As well as providing more checks, tests and scans, and help get waiting lists down, £2.3billion of the funding package will be used to try to transform diagnostic services. The Treasury said there will be at least 100 ""one-stop-shop"" community diagnostic centres across England, including the 44 already announced. These centres are expected to help clear most existing test backlogs caused by the pandemic, including for CT, MRI and ultrasound scans, by the end of the parliament.

In a furious behind the scenes dust up, The Sun can reveal Michael Gove ""point blank refused"" to be sat with any builders and later walked out of the lavish fundraising bash early. Tory HQ had advertised the 4 October party conference dinner with an offer for paying customers ""to place a preference of senior minister to host your table"" of 10 guests. But The Sun and Sky News have been told a number of Cabinet ministers were angered that the £400-a-head dinner attempted to seat them near paying punters with interests directly involving their ministerial briefs. A senior minister said: ""Nobody really wants to do these dinners because there is always a risk of conflict of interest but this one was a joke."" It was claimed requests for Mr Gove to dine with property firm executives sparked a furious backlash from the Cabinet big beast who sources say ""point blank refused to come"" if he was sat with any of them.

The missile is reported to travel five times faster than the speed of sound, meaning it could potentially hit any target on Earth. The Communist regime, led by President Xi Jinping, has denied testing a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile in August, insisting it was a routine spacecraft check. But a senior government minister told The Sun: ""They would say that, wouldn't they? China always lies."" Boris Johnson's spokesman said: ""We will keep a close watch on this development but it is important that those with these capabilities behave responsibly."" Meanwhile the state's official newspaper Global Times boasted: ""It is inevitable that China will take an upper hand over US military strength."" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said: ""We have made clear our concerns about the military capabilities China continues to pursue."" Sam Ashworth-Hayes, director of research at the Henry Jackson Society think tank, warned that developing hypersonic weapons ""could make people trigger-happy"".",Real Sun,178.0

Amid soaring energy bills and the highest forecourt prices in almost a decade, Tory MPs last night urged the Chancellor to back The Sun's ""Keep It Down"" campaign. Powerful Conservative backbencher Robert Halfon told The Sun: ""With the cost of living rising and petrol and diesel prices up nearly 10p over the last few months, putting up fuel duty would be a slap in the face for workers."" ""Rishi should keep the freeze it and show families he is on their side."" Fellow Tory Craig Mackinlay added: ""With the pump price of fuel at an eight year high and other inflationary price rises hitting households this winter it would be grotesque for fuel duty to be raised at the forthcoming Budget and I hope the Chancellor will heed calls for a further freezing of duty."" And the MPs were backed by the FairFuelUK campaigned who warned: ""Hiking fuel tax would be political suicide and economically reckless. Founder Howard Cox urged Mr Sunak to not just freeze Fuel Duty, but cut it to help the pandemic recovery. He said: ""Cutting one of the most punitive motoring levies, in the world and at the same time reducing VAT on our home energy bills is the fiscally sensible way to deliver a booming post Covid economy."" Meanwhile the RAC yesterday demanded the Chancellor slash VAT on fuel. Spokesman Simon Williams said: ""With pump prices now so close to the record high prices of 2012, we think the Government should seriously consider temporarily cutting the level of VAT on motor fuel to help hard-pressed drivers. ""Unlike a reduction in fuel duty, which could just be swallowed up by retailers who are already taking more margin than ever, cutting VAT would benefit drivers immediately as it's charged on the final cost at the pumps."" RAC Fuel Watch says the average price of a litre of petrol has reached 140.22p, the highest level since September 2012 and just 2p off the record high that occurred in April of the same year. Prices have now gone up by nearly 26p a litre in 12 months, from 114.05p on this day last year – a rise of 22 per cent.

After days of Whitehall bickering, Kwasi Kwarteng presented Chancellor Rishi Sunak with a doom-laden map of British factories that could be forced to close down in weeks due to crippling energy costs. Energy intensive sectors like steel, ceramics, chemicals paper and glass production are all teetering on the edge after having to spend up to two thirds of their production costs on gas bills. The Treasury last night said they were studying the proposals for financial support, that could quickly stretch to hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayer cash in a cold winter. Last night a Business Department source said: ""Without urgent support to help British industry manage high global gas prices, factories will close – many for good - and thousands of jobs will be lost."" The Sun understands a range of interventions have been requested - with the Treasury insisting any support would be given on a case by case basis for individual companies. However targeted support for whole sectors such as glassmaking was not ruled out. Dave Dalton of British Glass told Times Radio last night that up to quarter of the 6,000 jobs employed directly in sector were under risk. A Treasury spokesman said: ""We have now received BEIS's submission and officials are looking through the details. We will do what is in the best interest of both consumers and taxpayers."" But angry Tory MP Steve Baker hit out: ""It'll be an absurdity if free marketeers like Kwasi Kwarteng and Rishi Sunak end up providing bailouts to firms or price cap policies. ""These are the kind of measures consistent with a socialist government and we shouldn't be doing them."" And the Institute of Economic Affairs warned: ""The steel, base chemicals, glass and paper sectors had previously been viewed as a serious long-term investment. ""Now they resemble twitching corpses, destined for one of two fates: another bailout, or nationalisation."" The proposals came after a weekend of bad blood between the two Cabinet ministers.

35,Real,The Sun,"TONE-DEAF ministers will next week announce plans to hike gas bills by £159, The Sun can reveal. Despite soaring energy costs and factories preparing to shutter this winter, Boris Johnson will double down on his controversial Net Zero Strategy ahead of next month's COP26 climate summit. And central to it will be the controversial Heating and Boiler strategy that will seek to make electricity cheaper and gas more expensive over the next 15 years. It will: The PM will argue that electricity - which is the cleanest it has ever been - is kept artificially expensive, hitting efforts to get people to switch to electric cars and central heating. But insiders say it will take years of listening exercises and legislation before the green levies currently slapped on electricity can be moved over to gas bills. The average green surcharge paid on household electricity bills is £159, with the money used to invest in renewable power generation and subsidise the poorest households' bills. Gas, although currently soaring in price, is taxed at a significantly lower rate despite being far more polluting. A Whitehall source said: ""As we move to a world where we use more electricity to heat our homes and charge our cars, we need to address the artificially high price of electricity."" They warn: ""Over the next decade, households will use more electricity - but pay less for it. And use less gas - but pay more for it."" However Mr Johnson faces fierce opposition from backbench Tory MPs over any plan that could see prices rise. However BoJo will argue switching away from gas will also see Britain suffer less from geo-political uncertainty. Yesterday ministers attempted to lay the blame for soaring gas prices squarely at the door of the Kremlin. Treasury Minister Lord Agnew said: ""The current squeeze on gas prices is nothing to do with the quantity of gas available. It is a geopolitical move by Russia to put pressure on Europe and we are caught up in that.""",Real Sun,334.0

37,Real,The Sun,"FRANCE swiped almost five million vaccine doses from Britain in a shocking post-Brexit tantrum. President Emmanuel Macron plotted with Brussels chiefs like a modern Napoleon Bonaparte as Britain's Covid jabs rollout humiliated the EU earlier this year. A massive batch of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine expected to arrive in the UK was instead diverted from Holland. The PM then successfully focused on keeping Pfizer jabs flowing. Tories last night said France's actions could have cost lives. In a post-Brexit strop they also threatened to stop the Pfizer vaccine being sent from Europe to the UK — despite our most vulnerable and elderly people desperately needing it for second jabs. However, Boris Johnson successfully focused on keeping the Pfizer flowing because it was so crucial to maintaining our rollout success. Raging ministers believe France's actions could easily have cost lives in the UK. They also compared their menacing threat to that of a ""hostile state"" rather than ""the behaviour of a close ally"". UK relations with France and Brussels hit rock-bottom in the spring — when Britain's vaccine rollout tore ahead of the EU's. On March 22, industry chiefs stated that a vaccine batch — enough to bottle several million doses — was expected to arrive in Britain imminently from its Halix site in Holland. But it never turned up — instead getting diverted to the EU's stuttering rollout scheme, sparking blazing rows between the Prime Minister and Mr Macron. Amid a bitter diplomatic spat, the EU blocked its transfer to the UK, making it clear it would never be granted a licence for export. This is despite the fact that France and other EU countries were sniping at the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab's effectiveness — and refusing to say if it was safe to give to the entire population. At the time an EU diplomat said: ""AstraZeneca has made promises to both the UK and the EU that it cannot fulfil. So there will need to be some sort of deal. ""But it's worth remembering that these Halix doses are in the EU, and AstraZeneca needs permission to ship any of them to the UK, so the cards are stacked against the UK."" It is also claimed France made a veiled threat to Mr Johnson that they would cut off supplies of Pfizer made on the continent, which would have destroyed Britain's jabs rollout. Senior government figures have compared the behaviour as ""akin to an act of war"", and blasted Mr Macron for acting like a mini Napoleon. One government source told The Sun: ""The French stole our vaccines at the same time as they were slagging them off in public and suggesting they weren't safe to use. WHAT a shabby, spiteful little trickster France's pipsqueak President proved to be. Macron acted like a clown over Brexit, insulting Britain for votes back home. That was the least of it. We now know he rubbished our AstraZeneca jab — doing untold, utterly unjustified and deadly harm to its global reputation — while blackmailing us out of five million doses we'd bought. He even refused to rule out cutting our Pfizer supply, despite it being needed in the spring to give second jabs to our must vulnerable and elderly people. The PM focused on keeping the Pfizer flowing — and thankfully succeeded. Yesterday a Macron aide threatened to cut the Channel Islands' power in a tantrum over fish. Macron withdrew his US and Australian ambassadors over the AUKUS submarines deal. No wonder the Aussies picked more reliable allies. Much more of Macron and France will gain pariah status. ""It was an outrageous thing to do and not the action of an ally, which was made very clear to them. ""Withholding vaccines by stopping them leaving the EU had the potential to cost lives with people waiting for both first and second jabs. ""We had a solid vaccine plan in place and this meant we were able to keep on jabbing. But it was an astonishing, outrageous thing to do."" Under the EU's controversial ban, all vaccine makers had to notify national authorities when exporting. Brussels could then step in and block shipments to countries whose rollouts were better than its own. The vaccine spat earlier this year plunged Britain's relations with the EU into crisis less than a month after it had formally left the bloc. EU chiefs launched an all-out assault on Oxford/AstraZeneca, with Mr Macron falsely claiming it did not work in over-65s and branded it ""quasi-ineffective"". EU boss Ursula von der Leyen also accused the UK of cutting corners in its approval of the jab. The result was devastating, with many Europeans shunning the life-saving vaccine amid the bogus safety fears.",Real Sun,776.0

Defence sources have claimed that 37-year-old Ben Slater, who was imprisoned by the Taliban last month has been let go and is on a plane back. The ex-soldier was arrested while attempting to help hundreds of Afghans to leave the country. The Sun understands evacuation was done under the direct supervision of the Secretary of State for Defence. Slater who ran his business Nomad Concepts Group in Afghanistan, was trying to evacuate his staff over a land border, reports Sky News. A UK government source said he flew out of Kabul to Doha on the same flight as the Prime Minister's High Representative for Afghan Transition Sir Simon Gass, and Dr Martin Longden Chargé d'Affaires of the UK Mission to Afghanistan. Slater was questioned when a coach carrying members of his staff was stopped at a border. He was planning to cross into a third country after not being able to secure spots for them on the British airlift. He was eventually allowed to cross the border with one assistant but the rest of his staff had to remain in Afghanistan, the Telegraph had reported at the time. It comes amid fears the Taliban may cancel their pledge to allow people to leave Afghanistan. Back in August a statement by the UK government along with the US and more than 90 other countries, confirmed that the Taliban had said anyone who wished to leave the country could do so.

But that would see the average Band D home see their annual bill soar by £475 to more than £2,370 by 2024.

Without extra cash they warn ""care for older and disabled people, child protection, homelessness prevention, waste and recycling, and road maintenance"" will all suffer. With widespread bankruptcies of local service providers predicted by 2024, pressure is mounting on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to use next year's National Insurance raid to to pay for social care sooner.

51,Real,The Sun,"BORIS Johnson told Emmanuel Macron to ""get a grip"" last night as he compared France's meltdown over the new UK, US and Aussie defence to the behaviour of a jilted lover. The PM slammed the door to France or any other country joining the new AUKUS agreement as he announced plans to widen it far beyond nuclear submarine secret sharing. And teasing the hopping mad French premier, BoJo appeared to compare Macron's epic diplomatic temper tantrum to the hurt of a romantic breakup. While Australia swear blind they gave the Paris fair warning that they were tearing up a £50 Billion submarine deal to go with the UK and US instead, Macron says it was a ""stab in the back"" out of the blue. Rejecting claims the French were stitched up or blindsided, Mr Johnson said ""there are no easy ways of having these conversations."" ""It's a very human thing to delay the conversation until the last possible moment...I don't know if anyone has been in that situation in their emotional life, but it's very human to put it off."" Yesterday morning the PM had called for calm despite the French being billions out of pocket. Slipping into Franglais he joked: ""I just think it's time for some of our dearest friends around the world to prenez un grip (get a grip) about this and donnez-moi un break (give me a break). But last night he risked inflaming tensions by saying France would never be able to join the new pact and it would look to widen its depth to sharing intelligence and cyber technology. He said: ""It's about three countries who have shared values and perspectives and such a high degree of trust they are willing to share very important details."" He added ""this is the right team"" to build a bulwark against Chinese aggression in fields like Artificial Intelligence and cyber security. It is understood that the allies believe the French over-reaction is due to their embarrassment at their intelligence and security services failing to spot the deal coming as well as a diplomatic haggle for higher compensation for the abandoned contract. AUKUS saw Sydney tear up a contract with Paris for new diesel-powered submarines, in favour of superior nuclear-powered US and UK boats.

Mr Biden said he would visit Glasgow ""with bells on"" for the COP26 summit, adding he was anxious to attend. But the PM was yesterday unable to say a post-Brexit agreement with Washington could be signed before the next election in 2024 — after admitting the US had other ""fish to fry"". The ball is in the US's court... it takes two to tango The President was gloomy about the prospects of a trade deal when meeting with Boris Johnson in the Oval Office. Asked by The Sun if Britain was still ""back of the queue for a deal"" as threatened by Barack Obama in 2016, Mr Biden said: ""We'll have to work that through"" and added they would ""talk a little about it today."" The lukewarm response came as he warned he felt ""very strongly"" about peace in Northern Ireland and would step into over any threat to a hard border with Ireland from Brexit. The north-American USMCA pact is a Trump-era low tariff and quota agreement and is seen as a ""backdoor"" to a full UK/US bilateral accord. Joining would mark a dramatic shift away from our traditional European ties. It is understood that new Foreign Secretary Liz Truss pitched the idea of the UK joining the USMCA to her US counterpart Antony Blinken at their first meeting on the fringes of this week's UN summit in New York.

Arriving in New York to meet 100 world leaders at the UN General Assembly the PM was tackled on the thorny issue of how to get worldwide jab rates up to the levels of developed nations. But he risks a row with some poorer nations desperate for more vaccines as the over-50s in the UK begin to get their top-up shot. Speaking on board his RAF Voyager on Sunday night, BoJo defended his booster programme saying: ""If you ask me, should we interrupt the booster programme for elderly and vulnerable people in this country, well I've looked at the evidence for what boosters can do. ""I've looked at the extra protection it can give people, and I have to say I think that that has to be our priority and we're going to continue to do that."" But he insisted the UK was leading the way in jabbing the world: ""That doesn't mean we're not making also a massive commitment to the rest of the world, because we fundamentally agree that nobody's safe until everybody is safe."" He added: ""Because of the deal we did with AstraZeneca, I think about a billion vaccines have been distributed around the world at cost to people who might not otherwise have been able to afford them.

He will urge them to step up on climate change in the last 50 days before November's get-together. And he will announce an additional £500million of UK funding to help poorer countries move away from coal. Mr Johnson said he would push the leaders to take ""concrete action on coal, climate, cars and trees"". It is still not known whether Chinese president Xi Jinping will attend Cop26, although a delegation from the globe's most polluting nation will be there. Cop26 President Alok Sharma said: ""I'm hopeful he will come."" It is thought that Mr Johnson will make an ""impassioned"" case to the US President, over why he should lift the travel ban. This could mean that fully vaccinated people in the UK may be able to travel directly into America after Mr Biden's failure to ease restrictions.

BoJo moved to soothe the explosive diplomatic spat after Paris was left massively out of pocket by a new defence pact forged between the UK, US and Australia - dubbed AUKUS. France had been due to sell the Aussies £47 billion worth of diesel powered subs - but the Australian government dramatically ripped up the contract last week in favour of nuclear boats from Britain and America. President Macron threw such a big hissy fit in response that he cut off diplomatic ties with Washington and Canberra, while his ministers went on the onslaught against Britain. But despite their rage, the PM said: ""I don't think anyone needs to worry… particularly not our French friends."" His comments came as Paris government figures queued up to slam the PM for ""stabbing an ally in the back."" French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian - who will have face to face talks with the UK in at the United Nations General Assembly in New York this week - accused BoJo of ""permanent opportunism"". Meanwhile gobby French Europe Minister Clement Beune whined: ""Our British friends explained to us they were leaving the EU to create Global Britain. We can see that this is a return into the American lap and form of accepted vacillation."" But quizzed on his way to the UN in New York, the PM laughed off the barrage of insults. He told The Sun: ""We are very, very proud of our relationship with France and it is of huge importance to this country. ""It is a very friendly relationship - and entente cordial - that goes back a century or more and it absolutely vital for us.

""Well we simulate the testing of nuclear explosions together I should add we don't actually blow anything up!

63,Real,The Sun,"ALL over-50s will be offered a booster jab by Christmas as part of a Covid winter plan, PM Boris Johnson will announce today. Ministers have also approved the offer of single jabs for 12 to 15-year-olds, triggering a row over consent. They hope the additional kids' rollout will slash transmission rates in schools and prevent any further closures in the colder months ahead. Chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said last night it will ""reduce"" the risks of shutting classes in the event of a surge in cases, but will ""not eliminate"" the possibility. He added: ""We think it's an important and useful additional tool to reduce the public health impacts that come through educational disruption."" Currently only over-16s are being jabbed but there has been widespread pressure to extend the rollout. Meanwhile, the decision to give boosters to over-50s ends months of deliberation by experts. Scientists deemed one additional dose of Pfizer is the most effective booster — regardless of what people had in their two shots. The Covid winter plan, which attempts to avoid another national lockdown, will be published today. Mr Johnson said ahead of its launch: ""The pandemic is far from over. ""But thanks to our phenomenal vaccine programme, new treatments and testing we are able to live with the virus without significant restrictions on our freedoms. ""Today I will set out a clear plan for the autumn and winter, when the virus has a natural advantage, to protect the gains we have made."" Prof Whitty added: ""Anybody who believes the big risk of Covid is all in the past . . . has not understood where we are going to head as we go into autumn and winter, where there will continue to be challenges and pressure on the NHS."" For older Brits the booster rollout will begin within days, starting with the over-80s and the clinically vulnerable. Prof Whitty insisted there was enough Pfizer to go around for old and young. There were also ""no plans"" yet to jab the under-12s.",Real Sun,333.0
64,Real,The Sun,"JABS for younger kids finally got the go-ahead last night — risking a battle between them and parents over consent. Children between 12 and 15 will be able to overrule mums and dads and choose whether or not to get vaccinated. But experts said kids faced being bullied and stigmatised in the playground for refusing the jab. And angry teachers and MPs demanded clearer guidance from PM Boris Johnson and his ministers. More than three million younger teens could start receiving Pfizer doses within days after Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said the ""difficult decision"" had been made to expand the rollout. Despite the US, Israel and several European countries soaring ahead of Britain's trailblazing jabs head-start, Professor Whitty said he had wanted time to assess as much of the evidence as possible before making a decision. Health chiefs said the decision was about ""balancing risk and benefits"" of the effect on kids missing more school. Prof Whitty added he was not saying children must get the jab, but there were benefits to them doing so, including protecting their mental health and stopping them missing more classes. Long-standing law in England and Wales means kids under 16 can make the case for why they should have certain medical procedures against their parents' wishes. Dubbed ""Gillick competence"", it means children can get vaccines or medicine if they can prove they fully understand the risks and are making a consenting choice. But ex-health minister Steve Brine said he was ""very concerned"", adding: ""I don't really want to set up a situation whereby we're setting up an argument — potentially a legal argument between children and their parents as to whether they should be allowed to have this vaccination."" He continued: ""Somebody emailed me this weekend saying they have to sign a consent form for teachers to put sun cream on their child. ""But now, apparently, it's going to be OK for the child to decide to have a vaccine of a very, very new drug — not something that's been around for 20 or 30 years like some of the other immunisations that we give to our children."" And Professor Simon Clarke, from Reading University, warned that giving youngsters the final say could lead to children being bullied by their peers into taking the jab. He said: ""You may end up in a situation where a minority, probably the unvaccinated, will get bullied and excluded by other children."" Dr Liz Whittaker, a children's doctor at St Mary's Hospital in West London, said: ""Under no circumstances should those young people who choose not to have the vaccine be stigmatised. ""It should not be a limiting factor for school access, extracurricular activities or school trips."" One doctor argued against the decision to even allow jabs for children. GP Renee Hoenderkamp said: ""The vaccine achieves nothing. ""Kids can still catch and transmit Covid and will get sent home when they do."" But Professor Whitty threw his weight behind kids to make their own decisions — while echoing warnings there was a risk of them being bullied in class by others who don't share their views. He insisted: ""I would not underestimate the ability of children and young people to understand important issues that affect them directly. I think it is easy to do so."" However, he added: ""It is very important there is no stigmatisation, either for accepting or not accepting vaccinations — this is critical."" He said that in the ""great majority of cases, children and parents come to the same decision"", but accepted that there was ""some debate"" about what to do if there was a family clash. Meanwhile, head teachers' union boss Geoff Barton warned his members had been threatened as the debate over jabs for kids raged. He said: ""Many have been receiving letters from various pressure groups, threatening schools and colleges with legal action if they take part in any Covid vaccination programme. ""This is extremely unhelpful and we'd ask those involved to stop attempting to exert pressure on schools and colleges. ""The question of whether or not to offer vaccinations to this age group has been thoroughly considered and the decision on whether or not to accept this offer is a matter for families."" Office for National Statistics data indicates that most parents would be likely to accept a Covid vaccine for their child. Around 86 per cent reported they would definitely, or probably, say yes. In comparison, six per cent of secondary school parents said they would definitely not want their child to have a vaccine.",Real Sun,758.0

67,Real,The Sun,"BORIS Johnson will unveil his Winter Plan to avoid a Christmas lockdown tomorrow — with booster jabs for the over-50s at its core. The Sun can reveal third doses are to be rolled out in a similar way to the first vaccine drive, starting with the most elderly and vulnerable. As the vaccines are taken up they will then be offered to younger and younger age groups. The PM is pinning his hopes on avoiding widespread disruption this winter with top-up jabs and a massive flu shot blitz backed by a giant ad campaign urging people to get the double protection. If that does not work and the NHS starts coming under too much pressure, vaccine passports, more indoor masks and interventions such as working from home will have to return. Health Secretary Sajid Javid also suggested to Times Radio yesterday that ministers were considering giving children just one shot of the vaccine as part of a rollout to 12 to 15-year-olds. But he promised everything will be done to avoid another shutdown of the economy. He added: ""Of course we get Christmas. I'm not anticipating any more lockdowns. I just don't see how we get to another lockdown."" He also revealed that ministers have bowed to Tory pressure and ditched a plan for vaccine passports for clubs and stadiums at the end of this month. Mr Johnson had vowed to make jabs compulsory for big venues from the end of September, but climbed down after a major backlash from his own party. Opinion in Westminster was split over whether Mr Johnson was simply using the passports as a threat to get more people to take up the vaccine — or whether he had been warned he may not have the votes to pass them into law. In a morning of mixed messages, the Health Secretary first said no final decision had been made on Covid passports for clubbers — before confirming they would not go ahead just one hour later. Half an hour after that, Mr Javid said they would be kept under review, adding: ""What I can say is that we've looked at it properly and whilst we should keep it in reserve as a potential option, I'm pleased to say that we will not be going ahead with plans for vaccine passports."" A lot of these powers can go and we should dispose of them, but some of them are necessary to keep, such as requiring people to self-isolate if they test positive He also confirmed that some measures — such as the ability to shut workplaces and schools — will be stripped from Covid Emergency laws, but others will be rolled over for another six months. He told the BBC: ""A lot of these powers can go and we should dispose of them, but some of them are necessary to keep, such as requiring people to self-isolate if they test positive — we will keep that power."" Mr Johnson will unveil the package at a press conference tomorrow before trying to shoehorn his new health tax through the Commons the same day. There is also mounting speculation he will reshuffle his Cabinet as soon as Wednesday, before the Commons rises for the annual party conference season and Mr Johnson heads away on international travel. Last night the U-turn on vaccine passports for venues was welcomed by the hospitality industry. The co-founder of Parklife Festival, Sacha Lord, who is also night time economy adviser for Greater Manchester, said: ""The plans were untenable and illogical and there were multiple factors which would have been discriminatory and legally questionable. Today's announcement is not something to celebrate, it's merely common sense returning and I thank all those that campaigned against them. ""As a sector, we can now move forward, without hesitation or vague regulations."" Adam Brooks, landlord of the Three Colts pub in Buckhurst Hill, Essex, told The Sun: ""Since Boris threatened vaccine passports I have hardly slept with worry — worry over my industry. ""It's businesses and it's jobs. I was fearful for my kids and the possibility of an authoritarian future. ""Today's announcement is not something to celebrate, it's merely common sense returning and I thank all those that campaigned against them."" But asked whether ministers were removing too many measures designed to keep the public safe, he said the Government should not be introducing coronavirus rules ""just for the sake of it"".",Real Sun,735.0

Jail bosses have launched an investigation after the reply to the lag fell foul of sophisticated drug screening equipment and was not passed on. When the letter — written on House of Commons headed note-paper — arrived at the jail, it was found to have been exposed to a significant amount of ecstasy powder MDMA. Further investigation showed the envelope and letter, franked with the postmark of the House of Commons, contained traces of the drug, it was revealed last night. A prison source said: ""It was a very odd case but someone who has handled the letter somewhere along the line could have had enough on their hands for our scanners to pick up."" The letter was sent by a junior official in the Palace of Westminster on March 22 to HMP Coldingley in Surrey. The inmate had requested information from the Commons' library, which holds statistics and reports about parliamentary matters. This evening prison bosses confirmed to The Sun that they had launched a formal investigation. And the prison's guards have also raised the issue directly with the Ministry of Justice. The Prison Service said: ""Diligent security staff at HMP Coldingley stopped a suspicious letter reaching a prisoner. An investigation is under way.""

The now-Labour leader repeatedly blocked his party from supporting a compromise that would have got us out of the EU quicker, No10 aide Gavin Barwell claims. His stance collapsed cross-party talks and was allegedly a ""colossal misjudgment"" that triggered Labour's catastrophic 2019 election defeat. Sir Keir, tasked with his party's Brexit strategy, even attacked proposals that he himself had put forward. Former PM Theresa May was so desperate to get any form of Brexit deal through parliament the dying days of her premiership, that she threw open her negotiation strategy to the Labour Party. Barwell says of a compromise deal to break the bitter Brexit deadlock in spring 2019: ""Jeremy Corbyn wanted to do it, but Keir Starmer stopped it. ""It seems fitting that he's now dealing with the consequences."" He adds: ""Starmer was not prepared to settle for anything that didn't include a confirmatory vote"".",Real Sun,159.0
70,Real,The Sun,"SENIOR Tory Gavin Williamson vowed to unleash ""the world's biggest s**tshow"" on the Government, a new book claims. He allegedly made the threat while fighting for his job as Defence Secretary in 2019. The book says Mr Williamson warned then PM Theresa May he would not go quietly if she fired him. But he was given the chop after being accused of leaking state secrets — a claim he has always denied. The punchy memoir from ex-No10 chief of staff Gavin Barwell comes after a bruising week for Mr Williamson, who is widely tipped also to be sacked from his current role as Education Secretary. He was dubbed ""gaffe-a-day-Gav"" after blundering into a race storm by confusing footballer Marcus Rashford for rugby ace Maro Itoje. He has also faced flak over schools and exams chaos. In his book ""Chief of Staff — notes from No10"" — published next week, Mr Barwell says: ""Having set out why he felt he was being badly treated, Gavin moved on to threats. If the Prime Minister tried to get rid of him, there would be the world's biggest s**show. ""If we thought he was the kind of person who would take the blame for something he hadn't done, we were misjudging his personality. ""And if the Prime Minister tried to get rid of him, there would be the world's biggest s***show.""

71,Real,The Sun,"BORIS Johnson will next week unveil a ""toolbox"" of contingency measures to see off a winter lockdown and keep Britain open, The Sun can reveal. Ministers will give the go-ahead to vaccine booster shots, Covid passports for clubs and stadiums and the biggest flu jab rollout in history to ease pressure on the NHS. An advertising blitz will urge the most vulnerable to get a third Covid jab and a flu shot to try to stop hospitals being overwhelmed if cases keep rising. The PM is privately vowing another lockdown is out of the question and has ordered the Government to do everything possible to avoid future restrictions. He will stress it is time to ""learn to live with Covid forever"" but wants to see the hated Coronavirus Act 2020 renewed as a precaution. The emergency powers within it expire at the end of this month, so the PM will force a vote on extending them for another six months. Dozens of Tory MPs are opposed to the move, with one MP branding renewals a ""tyranny"". Allies of the PM say the jabs rollout means this winter will be ""different"" but ministers refuse to rule out a return to some restrictions if the NHS looks under stress. It is hoped the double shot whammy will keep pressure on the health service to within seasonal norms — despite hospital admissions steadily ticking up Figures published last night reveal that 8,085 Brits are in hospital with Covid — a six-month high. The number has gone up by six per cent in a week and is at its highest since early March. However, it is still well below the second peak in January when 39,254 were in hospital — the most since the pandemic began. Hospital numbers have been rising slowly since the third wave of the virus began in May. A key ally of the PM told The Sun last night: ""The strength of our vaccination programme has changed how we tackle and live with this virus. ""It's going to be different this year. ""We will have the booster programme to give the most vulnerable an extra shot of protection and the highest number of people yet will be offered a flu jab."" Yesterday Health Secretary Sajid Javid said he felt sure the vaccine booster programme would start before the end of this month. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has said the Pfizer and AstraZeneca jabs are safe to use as boosters. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has yet to give its advice to ministers. Mr Javid said yesterday: ""We are heading towards our booster programme, so the news from the MHRA today is welcome. ""But also I want to wait for the final opinion of the JCVI. I'm confident our booster programme will start later this month but I'm still awaiting the final advice."" Leading lockdown sceptic Sir Iain Duncan Smith warned that the economy would ""drop to the levels of the Third World"" if the UK is forced into a third lockdown. He told The Sun: ""The only 'toolbox' we need is a crystal clear commitment never to shut down this country again. ""Boris promised we are on a road out and there can be no turning back. ""Unless the toolbox means no lockdowns ever again, frankly the Government will be a box of tools."" Meanwhile, ministers said last night that NHS staff could be assigned office jobs if they refuse to get a Covid jab as they floated proposals to make them mandatory. Care minister Helen Whately said: ""If you don't want to get vaccinated, how can it be right to continue to look after people who are really vulnerable from Covid?"" Vaccination will become a legal requirement for care home staff from November and it could be widened to cover everyone who comes into contact with patients. But unions warned staff will walk out, worsening shortages, if colleagues are compelled to be jabbed. Sara Gorton, of Unison, said: ""The key to convincing hesitant staff is persuasion, not force."" So far 88 per cent of NHS staff have been double-jabbed and 92 per cent have had one dose — higher rates than the public. But only 69 per cent of care workers have been double-jabbed with 82 per cent on one dose — lower than the public. COVID cases shot up in schoolkids when term started last week — but they are still stable overall. Figures show the infection rate in ten to 19-year-olds in England surged 42 per cent in the seven days to 681 per 100,000 people. The UK yesterday recorded 38,013 more cases and another 167 deaths.

72,Real,The Sun,"BORIS Johnson today unveiled a massive raid on shareholder profits to raise billions for the NHS and Social Care. The PM today revealed a 1.25 per cent hike to National Insurance contributors from workers and firms today - as well as a new tax assault on investors. Cabinet sources say people paid in dividends will still be allowed a personal allowance before the the new tax hike kicks in, with only the most profitable investors affected. The PM and Chancellor Rishi Sunak will hope the move will offset claims that their raid on workers' wages is unfair as well as raise additional billions every year to plug fiscal black-holes in both the NHS and social care budgets. Boris said in his Commons statement: ""We will be asking better-off business owners and investors to make a fair contribution too. ""In fact, the highest earning 14 per cent will pay around half the revenues, no-one earning less than £9,568 will pay a penny, and the majority of small businesses will be protected, with 40 per cent of all businesses paying nothing at all."" But the move is likely to trigger an angry backlash from Tory MPs who claim to be the party of capitalism. Boris Johnson today broke a key election promise by hitting millions with more taxes.",Real Sun,216.0
73,Real,The Sun,"BORIS Johnson will today warn the NHS will never recover from Covid without tax rises as he shreds his manifesto promise not to hike National Insurance. In a bid to see off a massive Tory rebellion, the PM will vow to use the cash to increase current NHS capacity by a million treatments a year to try to shift the pandemic backlog by the next Election. His allies claim that boost will see a 10 per cent increase in current capacity in the next two to three years as BoJo vowed not to ""duck the tough decisions needed to get NHS patients the treatment they need."" A 1.25 per cent raise to NI contributions from both workers and firms will then be used to fund the ""catastrophic"" black hole in social care - with care costs capped at £80,000 a year. The point at which the elderly begin to pay for their own care will also be significantly raised. Last night Downing Street said: ""Under the current care system, anyone with assets over £23,350 pays for their care in full. ""This can lead to spiralling costs and the complete liquidation of someone's assets. Around one in seven people now pay over £100,000, and there is an unfair and often catastrophic discrepancy between someone who has dementia paying for their care in full, while someone cared for by the NHS receives care for free."" No10 also claimed 5 million people are still waiting for surgery and treatment since the virus hit and that could more than double to 13 million without an urgent cash injection. Mr Johnson will use a press conference today flanked by the Health Secretary and Chancellor - who signed off the plan over the weekend - to insist Covid has ""changed the NHS for the foreseeable future"". Last night the PM said: ""The NHS is the pride of our United Kingdom, but it has been put under enormous strain by the pandemic. We cannot expect it to recover alone. ""We must act now to ensure the health and care system has the long term funding it needs to continue fighting COVID and start tackling the backlogs, and end the injustice of catastrophic costs for social care."" But his plan has been hit by a torrent of criticism as the retired do not pay National Insurance and it disproportionately hits the lower paid. Senior Tory MP John Redwood branded the plan stupid and one of the PM's closest friends warns in today's Sun he must think again on his ""inherently unfair"" raid. Former Northern Powerhouse Minister Jake Berry writes: ""Young working families who struggle to pay their mortgages and put shoes on their kids' feet will be paying for the care of wealthy pensioners who don't pay NI. That's inherently unfair. It's the opposite of this Government's levelling up agenda. It's levelling down."" Mr Johnson was swept to his landmark 2019 election win on a pledge not to touch NICs, but last night ministers insisted the ""unforeseeable"" pandemic had left the manifesto in tatters. Mr Johnson is also expected to announce a temporary pause on his pensions triple lock promise - to stop pensioners getting a whopping 8 per cent rise this year. But the move will require legislation setting up a major parliamentary showdown. Last night Mr Sunak told Tory MPs there was a ""tough autumn ahead"" with ""disagreements"" coming. However, Red Wall poster girl Dehenna Davison, who turned Bishop Auckland in Durham blue, blasted: ""I was elected on this manifesto… we absolutely cannot go against this manifesto"". And Rother Valley MP Alex Stafford warned: ""Conservatives should not be raising taxes willy nilly."" That's inherently unfair. It's the opposite of this Government's levelling up agenda. It's levelling down. Yesterday Mr Berry - who left the Cabinet last year- also turned fire on Health Secretary - accusing him of being a tax rise turn coat. The Northern Tory ringleader hit out: ""When I was sat round that Cabinet table and Sajid Javid was the chancellor of the exchequer writing the Conservative Party manifesto, he was a great believer in not racking up the jobs tax and I just wonder why he's had a sort of Damascene conversion when becoming the Health Secretary to seeing the jobs tax as the way forward."" Mr Johnson's Cabinet will meet tomorrow to rubber stamp the plan - with as many as five said to be privately opposed to the tax raid. There was also anger last night that the majority of ministers were kept in the dark about the details ahead of the meeting. One branded the plan ""electoral roulette"" after Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg warned publicly that voters have long memories for broken promises over tax. In a bid to quell Tory anger at the move, both Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak pressed the flesh last night in person at a party welcoming MPs back to Westminster after the summer break and lockdown. Mr Sunak made a public show of loyalty to the PM and urged all Tories to get behind Mr Johnson, saying: ""I, like all of you, take our lead from the Prime Minister.

Boilers produce nearly 15 per cent of Britain's carbon emissions - which the government has vowed to abolish by 2050.

Boris Johnson is falling woefully short on his vow to level up Britain according to a study that lays bare the North/South divide. In the 43 mainly northern and midlands areas that switched from Labour to Conservative in the 2019 General Election, around a third more adults have no qualifications when compared with the rest of the country. Big private investment firms plugged just £83.20 per head into those regions, compared to a national average of £145.60 last year. And businesses in other parts of the country were able to borrow at rates 42 per cent higher, and start up rates are almost a fifth lower in the red wall. A landmark study by Legatum Institute on prosperity in Britain shows just how far Boris Johnson is falling short of his vow to level up the nation so far. Their UK Prosperity Index 2021 found there are 13.8 per cent more deaths between the ages of 20 and 64 in the ""red wall"" and 31 per cent more homicides compared with the national average. The ""red wall"" seats swept the Tories to an historic Election win in 2019, but those voters are still amongst the most left behind in Britain. The study compared more than 256 different indicators of prosperity across all 379 local authorities in Britain. And it found that the Red Wall areas that put Mr Johnson into power remain significantly less well off that the rest of the country. But 35 of the 43 areas - four fifths - are in the bottom half of the league table. Voters there are also more likely to have diabetes, be disabled or be obese and rates for alcohol misuse are higher and life expectancy is more than a year lower. Last night, the PM's own Tory MPs in the North and Midlands called for action. Hartlepool came 361th out of 379 on the prosperity rankings - and their MP Jill Mortimer said: ""My town voted Conservative for the first time in a generation because of our promise to level up and create better opportunities. ""After two years of a pandemic and lockdown, that task has been made so much harder. ""My constituents don't want Government handouts - they want targeted solutions that empower them, their families and their communities to earn their way to prosperity.

Government scientists have raised the alarm that rates of the seasonal vomiting and tummy bug are way down this year - and could explode from September. Because we have all been washing our hands more, wearing masks and staying at home, there has been a drop in colds, flu and other seasonal illnesses spreading. So the boffins fear Britain is ripe for an unusually large outbreak because the ""transmission dynamics"" have changed. They point to September and October as ""particularly risky points"" and flagged the grim norovirus as a particular cause for concern. They had already warned that flu could be particularly bad this year - with more flu jabs rolled out in preparation - but now norovirus has been added to the list of concerns. Noro's most common symptoms include diarrhoea, vomiting and a high temperature. But scientists warn that could make spotting Covid cases ""more difficult"" if there is a big peak of both bugs. An inner committee of the SAGE group of scientists that advises Downing Street have now warned ministers it could get so bad that pressures on the NHS would be ""exacerbated"". Last month top doc Chris Whitty warned the NHS to ""brace"" itself for a hard winter – with a flu surge likely. He told a medical conference ""the coming winter may well be quite a difficult one"". On Covid he warned: ""We know that winter and autumn favour respiratory viruses, and therefore it'd be very surprising if this particular highly transmissible respiratory virus was not also favoured."" There is also a fear that such a big outbreak could trigger unknown problems that the NHS is not yet prepared for should there be ""interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and other infections, both in combination and in competition"".

If you or members of your household are ill: It reads: ""During the past 18 months, diseases such as influenza, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and norovirus, have been circulating much less in the population than in previous years.

New analysis of the Office for National Statistics crime data by the opposition shows that households in the very poorest areas of the country are more than FOUR times more likely to have their car stolen and TWICE as likely to have it damaged. Labour have studied the Crime Survey of England And Wales for the first quarter of 2020, comparing the rates of crime hitting the poorest 20 per cent of areas, compared to the richest fifth. Overall the poorest areas have 14 per cent more violent crime hitting the under 18s. And across nearly all categories of household crimes, those living in the most deprived areas are far more likely to be victims than those in the least deprived. The study was undertaken by Labour's new Child Poverty Secretary Wes Streeting, who told The Sun: ""Boris Johnson's Tories have become the party of crime and disorder, letting down the most vulnerable kids in our country."" The revelations are particularly concerning given that just last month the Home Office admitted the Covid crisis and poverty are causing growing alarm about soaring crime rates.

83,Real,The Sun,"MISCARRIAGE support groups have praised Carrie Johnson for discussing her heartache. Courageous Carrie, 33, revealed she lost a baby earlier this year but is now expecting her second child with Boris Johnson. In a statement on Instagram, the PM's wife said they were expecting a brother or sister to their first child Wilfred due to arrive in the winter. Ruth Bender Atik, of the Miscarriage Association, said talking about pregnancy after losing a baby was important as it can be an anxious time for a couple. She added: ""It's vital we think about partners and remember their needs and ask them how they're doing."" And Zoe Clark-Coates, of the Mariposa Trust, a baby loss and bereavement charity, told the BBC: ""We see a massive influx of people asking for support if anybody of note, or even a TV show covers the story of baby loss in their shows, we see a real influx of people. ""When people of note talk about their own loss it gives a lot of people the confidence to start speaking about it — and sharing their own personal stories."" Baby charity Tommy's said: ""Baby loss at any stage in pregnancy is one of the most devastating things that can happen to any family – and as Carrie said, this heartbreak is endured frequently but often silently because of the taboo in society."" Boss Jane Brewin added: ""Our research estimates that 1 in 4 pregnancies ends in loss but it's shrouded in secrecy, stigma and shame; mothers like Carrie sharing their stories is a vital step in tackling that. ""Some bereaved parents choose to grieve privately, but they can still find comfort and connection in reading others' stories, and people like Carrie speaking out sends a powerful message: this may feel incredibly lonely, but you are not alone.

Uber confirmed yesterday it will offer them £10 off a journey or takeaways such as kebabs this autumn. Bosses of the ride-hailing and food delivery apps said any fresher who posed for a selfie outside a vaccination centre would receive the voucher treat. Rivals Bolt and Deliveroo, as well as restaurant Pizza Pilgrims, were among two dozen other big brands tonight in talks with the Government to offer similar incentives. Ministers are concerned that only 67 per cent of people aged 18 to 29 in England have received a first dose of a vaccine. They are trying to use a ""carrot and stick"" approach to encourage greater take-up — especially before university terms start next month. The students' return will spark fears of a new Covid wave. Two jabs will be compulsory to enter a nightclub from the autumn. However, early efforts to look at forcing all students to be double jabbed were ditched after a backlash. In the coming weeks, a number of other incentives will be rolled out to sit alongside the threat of banning unvaccinated younger adults from venues. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said yesterday: ""Thank you to all the businesses who are stepping up to support this important vaccine drive."" And he urged young people: ""Once available, please go out and take advantage of the discounts."" Jabs minister Nadhim Zahawi added: ""Thank you to the businesses who have backed this mission — please get your jabs as soon as you can and grab a bargain."" Uber said it was proud to be working with the Government on this ""important campaign to encourage everyone to get their jab"". It said it would send a push notification to millions of its users' mobile phones next week to remind them to get jabbed as soon as possible. Bolt was ""delighted"" to support the campaign, declaring: ""Get a Bolt, grab a jab, get living."" The taxi firm will offer free ride credit for people to get to a vaccination centre across university towns and cities after a similar £250,000 offer to London vaccination facilities this year. Pizza Pilgrims founder Thom Elliot said: ""By making getting your jab as easy as grabbing a pizza, hopefully we can help our teams and our customers get their first and second doses as easily and quickly as possible."" Opinion was split on the latest move, with some of the most outspoken critics of vaccine passports giving the plan a cautious welcome. Broadcaster and former politician Nigel Farage said: ""It's better than bullying us I suppose."" But Tory MP Steve Baker hit out, saying that it would be ""simpler just to pay them a straight fee"". And Tim Blake, professor of politics at London's Queen Mary's University described the scheme as a ""gimmick"".

He added: ""Gimmicks are great and the Government should get some credit for thinking outside the box.

Forced isolation will no longer apply for the double-jabbed from August 16, but the Labour leader has now demanded it be brought forward to August 7. His plea yesterday came just weeks after he opposed lifting lockdown rules and scrapping masks — and his blasting of the relaxation of travel restrictions. Tory party chairwoman Amanda Milling compared Sir Keir to a weather vane as well as the ancient sex manual, saying: ""He points different ways depending on which day it is, changing position more often than the Kama Sutra to chase headlines and play politics."" Labour had said the latest border rules were ""reckless"" and that Boris Johnson was opening up the UK too fast.

He also previously criticised calls for the NHS app to be altered to stop so many people being ""pinged"" after contact with a Covid sufferer. In his latest about-face yesterday, Sir Keir urged the PM to follow Labour's lead in Wales after its First Minister Mark Drakeford confirmed August 7 as the day when double-jabbed adults can escape isolation. Scotland is expected to remove the need for fully vaccinated people to isolate on August 9. But Mr Johnson has insisted England is ""nailed on"" not to make the same move until August 16.

But in an interview with LBC radio, Boris Johnson said he did not think ""for one minute"" that the alterations, designed to account for shifting threats in the digital age, would be allowed to prevent journalists from carrying out investigations. The former journalist said: ""We don't - I don't - want to have a world in which people are prosecuted for doing what they think is their public duty and... in the public interest.

He will appear with Home Secretary Priti Patel this morning for a visit. Announcing the massive crime crackdown, the PM said: ""When I first stood on the steps of Downing Street as Prime Minister, I promised to back the police and make people safer, because we cannot level up the country when crime hits the poorest hardest and draws the most vulnerable into violence. ""That is why my Government has remained unstinting in its efforts to protect the British public and this plan delivers a fresh commitment, as we emerge from the impacts of the pandemic, to have less crime, fewer victims and a safer society."" The flagship measure will be a permanent uplift for sweeping powers for the police to Stop and Search suspected criminals to drive down soaring knife crime. So called Section 60 powers allow police to dramatically increase their Stop and Search tactics in areas where they anticipate violence - or following a stabbing to help find weapons and stop reprisals. The move consigns Theresa May's legacy to the dustbin of history. As both Home Secretary and PM, she battled against Stop and Search suggesting it was discriminatory and capping its use. But within days of taking over in 2019, Mr Johnson began unpicking that. Pilots have been running since then to allow all 43 police forces to use Stop and Search powers more often - and that will now be put on a permanent footing. MEASURES in the crime crackdown include: Home Office sources say the test schemes had led to officers having more confidence using Stop and Search and a knock on deterrent effect to would-be offenders.

97,Real,The Sun,"BORIS Johnson and Rishi Sunak are close to agreeing to hike National Insurance Contributions by at least one per cent to raise billions to pay for social care, The Sun can reveal. The planned new Health Tax is modelled on Gordon Brown's 2002 NICs raid - that the Tories dubbed at the time a ""tax on ordinary people"". The then Labour chancellor was accused of breaking election promises not to raise income tax by hiking national insurance to boost NHS spending. Senior sources say the PM and Chancellor were ""almost there"" at crunch talks on Friday aimed at filling a £7 Billion funding shortfall. But plans to announce the package later this week were plunged into chaos after the pair were forced into isolation when Health Secretary Sajid Javid got Covid. One Downing Street source said: ""It's going to be controversial and you can't really do much when the three salesmen pitching this to the country are locked up."" Voters and MPs have been crying out for a solution to the funding crisis, as thousands of people face crippling costs in old age. But such a move would smash the Conservatives manifesto commitment not to raise NICs, VAT or income tax in this parliament. However government sources say no other taxes are broad enough to raise money quickly to fill the blackhole in Britain's elderly care provision and the 2019 manifesto has been eclipsed by the pandemic. NICs are currently the Treasury's second-biggest revenue raiser, bringing in more than £150 billion in 2021/22 – accounting for one in five pounds raised in taxation. The tax is levied on the earnings of all individuals aged 16 or over and their employer. Most contribute around 12 per cent on their weekly earnings up to £967. A further 2 per cent is paid by the rich with any earnings above £967, with the self employed paying a lower rate. But using a hike to pay for social care risks a major row as over 67s do not pay it even if they are still in work - despite older people being the ones that will need the care soonest. Senior figures involved in the discussions say it would be pitched as an insurance option for younger people against bigger bills later in life, but did not dispute the fact the Tory manifesto ""tax lock"" is hanging by a thread. Last night The Sun probed the PM directly on whether his manifesto commitment not to raise National Insurance still stood. And Mr Johnson refused to answer.

101,Real,The Sun,"BORIS Johnson will today confront those Tory critics who believe he is too focused on the North. The Prime Minister will try to cool tempers within his party amid claims he cares only about the Red Wall seats he won in 2019. In the wake of last month's by-election defeat in a southern Tory stronghold, Mr Johnson will launch a passionate defence of his ""levelling up"" agenda. It comes as there are calls from his own MPs not to forget more traditional Conservative areas down South. And there was new pressure on the PM last night after polling showed his government was hit by its worst ratings since last October. But today he will vow to plough on pumping cash into ""left behind"" areas, adding: ""It is vital to understand the difference between this project and levelling down. ""We don't want to decapitate the tall poppies. You can't make the poor parts of the country richer by making the rich parts poorer. ""Levelling up is not a jam-spreading operation."" Mr Johnson insisted that plans to spend more in the North were ""not robbing Peter to pay Paul — it's not zero sum, it's win win"". Last month, the Lib Dems seized Chesham and Amersham in Bucks — a Tory seat since 1974 — amid rows over planning rules and the HS2 rail route that carves through the constituency. But Mr Johnson will insist that big building plans and travel projects to tilt the economic growth away from the ""overheating"" South will help all parts of the country. He will point to ""areas where house prices are sky high and where transport is already congested"". And he will blame his predecessors for putting too much focus there. On a visit to the West Midlands, he will say: ""By turbo-charging those areas — especially in London and the South East — you drive prices even higher and you force more people to move to the same expensive areas. ""The result is their commutes are longer, their trains are crowded, they have less time with their kids."" But a blow to him came with a survey by Ipsos MORI for the Evening Standard that showed 55 per cent of adults are dissatisfied with the Government — up seven percentage points from last month. Just 35 per cent are satisfied, down nine points. It gave ministers a net satisfaction rating of minus-20, compared to minus-four in June — with a strong collapse in support from female voters in the wake of the Matt Hancock affair scandal.",Real Sun,422.0
102,Real,The Sun,"GARETH SOUTHGATE looks set to become a 'Sir' in the New Year Honours list. Boris Johnson wants to give the England boss a knighthood after his side's scintillating run to the Euro 2020 final lifted the entire nation. Southgate was handed an OBE when the Three Lions made the 2018 World Cup semis — but now a knighthood is in his grasp despite the pain of Sunday's penalty shootout heartbreak against Italy. Sources say the Prime Minister is ""supportive"" of the top honour after England's first major final in 55 years. Last night Johnson declared: ""They made history. They lifted our spirits and they brought joy to this country — and I know they will continue to do so. Like millions of people across this country I woke up sad and rueful but also filled with pride and hope. ""And with thanks to Gareth Southgate and the whole England squad for the best campaign by any England team in any tournament that I can remember."" And last night a senior No 10 source told The Sun that gongs await the squad, with a knighthood likely to come for the gaffer: ""There's a process to go through but Gareth's achievements have been incredible. ""He's brought the country together in an amazing way. The PM would certainly be supportive of a knighthood."" The honours system recognises people who have ""committed themselves to serving and helping Britain"" and made achievements in public life. They must be ""outstanding"" in their field, or make life better for others — which millions of fans will argue England have done. After a nomination, the decision to proceed — and which honour they will receive — is decided by the sports honours committee in Whitehall. The body reviews applications, sending their recommendations to the PM and the Queen, who awards the honour. Health minister Edward Argar told LBC radio: ""I'm sure there will be many ways to say thank you to them and recognise that, and I suspect that will be looked at in the coming days."" Southgate's next mission is to lead England to glory with his young stars at the World Cup in Qatar next year. The Three Lions boss will honour his deal, which runs to 2022, but will not yet commit any further. Southgate, 50, said: ""I don't want to commit to anything longer than I should and I never want to outstay my welcome. ""I'd want to be taking the team to Qatar. I feel we've made progress in four years. It's probably as good as any team in Europe bar those who won the tournaments themselves."" Southgate was gutted by the final defeat but sees great hope in young stars like Bukayo Saka, 19, Phil Foden, 21, Jude Bellingham, 18, and Jadon Sancho, 21. He said: ""When you're so close it's more painful — it feels like my stomach has been ripped out. ""But our young ones are two, four years from peaking.

103,Real,The Sun,"RISHI Sunak has sprung a vote on slashing Britain's bloated £14 billion international aid bill TOMORROW. The Chancellor has been under mounting pressure to give MPs a say over his plan to reduce the UK's legally binding pledge to giveaway 0.7 per cent of the country's output to the needy. He insists that the cut to 0.5 per cent of GDP is needed to help plug the Covid black hole - and would save more than £4 billion every year. But Labour and a significant number of Tories are firmly against the plan, even though No. 11 say it will be a temporary pandemic fix. After the plan was announced at last November's Spending Review, the Commons Speaker ruled that Mr Sunak needed the legal underpinning of a vote to go ahead. But Conservative MPs including ex-Aid boss Andrew Mitchell and ex-PM Theresa May had warned they would vote against the move. Voting it down would plunge Treasury spending plans for the next year into chaos - prompting the government to initially try avoid a Commons showdown. But The Sun understands Mr Sunak has spent the weekend working on a compromise  - promising the reduction will automatically expire when the nation's finances are more stable. Under the compromise plan, the Aid budget will be restored once the independent Office of Budget Responsibility rules that we are no longer having to borrow cash for day to day spending, and our national debt falls to a specific percentage of GDP. Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg announced today that MPs will debate the cut - and details of the Treasury compromise - in a three hour session and vote on Tuesday. He told MPs ""it will be a yes or no answer."" ""If the House were to negative the motion.. then the government would consequently return to spending 0.7 on international aid"" with ""consequences for taxation.""

Nearly one in 12 state school pupils did not attend classes last week after coming into contact with a fellow student who tested positive. That was up 384,000 on the previous week, plunging schools across the country into disarray. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson announced last night bubbles would be replaced by focused testing and contact tracing from August 16. Under current guidance, children have to self-isolate for ten days if another pupil in their bubble — which can be an entire year group — tests positive. Schools will be able to continue with that system for the rest of term if they wish but the legal requirement will end before September. Instead, NHS Test and Trace will carry out contact tracing on pupils rather than the school or college working out who is at risk. The Education Sec also announced... Mr Williamson told MPs: ""Keeping children in consistent groups was essential to control the spread of the virus when our population was less vaccinated. ""We recognise that the system of bubbles and isolation is causing disruption to many children's education. ""That is why we'll be ending bubbles.""

105,Real,The Sun,"DRINKERS will be back standing at the bar ordering pints in TWO weeks time, Boris Johnson will declare today. The Prime Minister will address the nation this afternoon to set out his plans for Freedom Day - set for July 19 - that will see masks become voluntary in almost all settings and the end of table service in pubs and bars. Life will ""return to normality as far as possible"" with the one-metre plus social distancing rule lifted so punters can mingle and stand once again and will not need to scan QR to enter venues. And the rules telling people to avoid the office if they can will be changed to allow firms to choose how and where people work from July 19. Nightclubs will get the green-light to reopen without masks, although Brits will be urged to wear them in enclosed spaces like buses and trains - but only if they want to - with no fines for refusing. Tomorrow, the Government will finally publish their long awaited review into social distancing and vaccine passports - with widespread domestic use expected to be rejected. Mass events outdoors like full stadiums and festivals are also expected to get the go ahead, but with some element of testing or proof of vaccination. But plans for double jabbed Brits to no longer have to isolate after coming into contact with a Covid victim and mass-testing to replace bubbles that sees thousands of school kids sent home every week will NOT be announced today. A final decision on replacing both of those measures could come within days subject to Cabinet signing them off. And The Sun understands travel rules for fully vaccinated to visit amber-list countries without the need to quarantine are also set to be updated later in the week. We're going to now move into a period where there won't be legal restrictions, the state won't be telling you what to do Freedom Day will go ahead on July 19, subject to a final review in seven days time - even though cases continue to rise. Yesterday, another 24,258 positive cases were confirmed - but only 15 deaths were reported down nearly two per cent on week on week. Hospitalisations were up 24 per cent, with 1,953 admitted suffering from the disease in the last seven days. But with the arrival of upbeat new Health Secretary Sajid Javid - who declared on Sunday that lifting lockdown will actually help suffering Brits be HEALTHIER as well as boost the economy -  Boris Johnson has won his battle against Cabinet naysayers and overly cautious docs to push on for a ""maximalist"" approach to lifting Lockdown when Freedom Day comes. Yesterday top Cabinet Minister Robert Jenrick declared the data was looking ""very promising"" for a July 19 to go ahead, and top NHS boss Stephen Powis agreed the vaccine had ""weakened"" the link between Covid cases and deaths. Mr Jenrick confirmed the Freedom Day good news, telling TV interviews: ""We're going to now move into a period where there won't be legal restrictions, the state won't be telling you what to do"". He added: ""You will want to exercise a degree of personal responsibility and judgement - different people will come to different conclusions on things like masks, for example"" . The PM is expected to say:  ""Thanks to the successful rollout of our vaccination programme, we are progressing cautiously through our roadmap. Today we will set out how we can restore people's freedoms when we reach step 4. But Mr Johnson will warn the nation that cases will continue to soar and hospitalisations and deaths WILL go up in the coming weeks and months - but the time has come to live with the virus like the flu as the jab has slashed serious illness and deaths from Covid. He will add: ""I must stress that the pandemic is not over and that cases will continue to rise over the coming weeks. ""As we begin to learn to live with this virus, we must all continue to carefully manage the risks from Covid and exercise judgement when going about our lives."" As 20,000 a year die from influenza, with PM likely to face a barrage of questions on what he feels is an acceptable number of annual Covid deaths. Mr Johnson also faces a rearguard action from medics who want mask wearing to continue for months to come yet. Professor Adam Finn, from the Government's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said mask wearing is extremely valuable under certain circumstances and he does not plan to ditch his masks this month. He told Sky News: ""Well on a personal level I shall certainly be continuing to wear a mask if I've got any symptoms or if I'm in an enclosed space with lots of other people for a prolonged period of time, indefinitely in fact.""

106,Real,The Sun,"MORE than three million manual workers will have to retrain to meet Boris Johnson's green targets, experts warn today. In carbon-heavy industries such as building nearly a third of employees will have to be taught skills for equivalent roles in a net zero future. Brickies and bus drivers are among those who may have to learn to adapt if the UK is to meet its commitment to decarbonise industry completely by 2050. Think-tank Onward reckons 3.2million workers could be left behind without ""radical"" policy action now. It calls for new apprenticeships in green industry and ""net zero academies"" for regions with most high carbon jobs such as the North East and East Midlands. The organisation also wants to see tax credits for firms training workers in new jobs. It points out that the transport and construction industries are ""woefully prepared"" for the changes. But wages for the new green jobs, it adds, are almost a fifth higher than the national average and a third higher than existing roles in carbon-heavy jobs. Ted Christie-Miller, of Onward, says in a report that Whitehall has not woken up to the ""scale and urgency of the labour market challenge"". He states: ""Radical policies will be required to retrain or upskill millions of workers in both high-tech roles and low and medium-skilled technical qualifications to meet the challenge of net zero."" Caroline Flint, co-chair of the Getting to Zero commission, backed the report. The former Labour minister said: ""As Britain emerges from the economic trauma of this pandemic there's not a moment to waste. ""Onward has laid out in stark detail how ill prepared the British workforce is to meet the net zero skills challenge.

113,Real,The Sun,"MATT Hancock's career at the top of the Conservative Party was hanging by a thread last night as he was engulfed in a sleaze scandal. The shock development follows a torrid 18 months for the Health Secretary in which he has been battling the Covid pandemic — even catching it himself last year. Mr Hancock has spent the past few weeks dodging claims he bungled his handling of the bug — and was left embarrassed over leaked texts in which the PM branded him ""f***ing hopeless"". Just this week, the Queen was overheard describing the exhausted minister as a ""poor man"" but still ""full of promise"". Despite the runaway success of the vaccine rollout, it was already shaping up to be a bruising summer for the usually energetic Tory amid rumours he was for the chop at a pending reshuffle. He has been dogged by ""chumocracy"" claims that he had hired his mates and given party donors special VIP access to Covid contracts. Earlier this month, he was hauled before MPs for a gruelling evidence session to defend his record. But it is our bombshell revelation today that will be cricket-mad Matt's toughest wicket yet. And this afternoon, Mr Hancock apologised for his actions, saying: ""I accept that I breached the social distancing guidance in these circumstances. ""I have let people down and am very sorry. ""I remain focused on working to get the country out of this pandemic, and would be grateful for privacy for my family on this personal matter."" He has been privately canoodling with a glamorous pal he hired as his aide — in the very office from which he is meant to be leading Britain's response to the virus. After a meteoric rise through the backrooms of Westminster, he even had a tilt at the party leadership in 2019 — but bowed out to Boris Johnson after a poor show of support from colleagues. Already in his third cabinet post, aged just 42, he has had a relatively blemish-free career until this year. Like many a Tory MP before him, he drifted from an elite public school to Oxford to read philosophy, politics and economics — the training manual for Britain's modern political class. It was at Oxford that his path first crossed with Gina Coladangelo, a fellow undergraduate who would remain a close pal for the next two decades. But it was his fateful decision to hire her — first as an unpaid adviser last April and then as a £15,000-a-year non-executive director at the Health Department — that could yet be his undoing. After a masters at Cambridge in economics, Mr Hancock walked into a plum job at the Bank of England. While at Threadneedle Street, the rising star first caught the eye of the Conservative Shadow Chancellor at the time, George Osborne. And the lure of Westminster was too much for the nerdy twenty-something to resist. In 2006, Mr Osborne drafted the young whizzkid in to be his top adviser. But it was soon clear to colleagues that Matt was not content on a career in the shadows and eyed his own path to power. He married Martha, an osteopath, in 2006 and the pair have three children together. Elected MP for the ultra-safe seat of West Suffolk in 2010, he set his eyes on climbing the greasy pole as quickly as possible Sticking close to his powerful mentor Mr Osborne, he quickly drew ire from jealous colleagues who could see Matt destined for the fast track. One joke levelled at other ambitious MPs back then was they were ""so far up George Osborne's a*** they could see Matt Hancock's shoes"". Although he made enemies, the blessing of Mr Osborne soon saw him on the Government payroll, first as a junior minister in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in 2013, entering the Cabinet in 2016 as Minister for the Cabinet Office. Under Mr Osborne's guidance, he voted Remain in the 2016 referendum, and looked to be in the wilderness when his political godfather was dramatically sacked by new PM Theresa May in the wake of the historic vote. He accepted a demotion to a junior role at Culture, winning him plaudits as other key figures flounced off to the backbenches — and going some way to countering his Westminster reputation as an arrogant upstart. And his loyalty to the party and the new PM was rewarded with a Cabinet return in 2018 as Culture Secretary, and a massive promotion to Health shortly after. While seen as a ""safe pair of hands"" in Cabinet, regularly tasked with tricky media performances defending the Government, the pandemic that began to engulf Britain early in 2020 would be Mr Hancock's biggest test. A regular face seen fronting Government press conferences, with boundless enthusiasm for the jabs rollout, that handling of the crisis has come under fresh scrutiny in recent weeks as a massive row with No10 exploded into public view.

Plans to allow adults with two doses to travel in August to amber list countries are due to be announced within days. However, ministers are under growing pressure to bring forward the move to next month to save school holidays overseas. Some MPs are even said to be pressing Boris Johnson for travel curbs to be eased at the same time as restrictions are lifted at home  - on July 19. At the moment only people going to green-list countries are automatically free once they return home from travelling - although they do have to take at least two expensive PCR tests. Anyone coming back from an amber-list country has to quarantine for ten days at home. But a new system to allow adults who have had two doses to travel in August to and from such countries - including holiday France, Spain, Italy and Greece - without quarantining are set to be announced within days. And unjabbed family members aged under 18 will be able to fly too as they have not been offered the vaccine. Brits will find out later this week about any updates to the important green and amber travel lists. It comes as: Ministers will meet on Thursday to decide if any new countries should be added to the list of destinations where foreign holidays are currently allowed. However it's been reported official scientists have advised ministers that the Balearic Islands are now safe to be given green status. That would mean quarantine-free breaks to Ibiza, Mallorca Menorca and Formentera could resume within days.  Malta is also being tipped to be added. They would be the first mainstream holiday destinations on the list since the sudden removal of Portugal last month. However, mainland Spain will remain on the amber list, meaning that travel is advised against, and quarantine is required on return. Meanwhile, akey ally of Chancellor Rishi Sunak has already called for the changes to kick in sooner rather than later. Tory MP James Cartlidge has written to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps to demand double jabbed Brits be given freedom next month. He said: ""The proposal to restart international travel by allowing fully vaccinated people to go on holiday would be an absolute lifeline for this industry."" He added: ""I believe that allowing fully vaccinated people to travel is reasonable, and an important step we can take to support our fantastic travel business."" Sources have said Mr Sunak was supportive of the call but did not put his  right hand man up to writing the letter Earlier today Matt Hancock revealed that ministers were indeed looking at plans for whether double-vaccinated Brits might be able to avoid quarantine in future when they travel abroad. The Sun understands the new rules will mean under 16s will be able to go with their parents on holiday - but only if both parents have had two jabs. And it's likely they will have to wait two weeks after that for their protection to kick in - as is already the case in the EU travel rules. An announcement is expected as early as this week, alongside an update on the green, amber and red-list destinations. But as The Sun revealed yesterday, it's unlikely that many will be added - if any. At the moment only people going to green-list countries are free once they return home from travelling - though they do have to take at least three PCR tests. Anyone coming back from an amber-list country has to quarantine for ten days at home. And those returning from a red-list destination have to stay in dedicated quarantine hotels, paying a whopping £1,750 for the privilege. Boris Johnson has been accused of letting Germans steal a march in the sunbed wars - as double-jabbed Brits still have to stay away from many beach destinations thanks to strict travel rules. Germans are free to travel and have wasted no time getting the towels down despite the EU's bungled jabs rollout and the country averaging more than 100 deaths a day. Scientists, MPs, travel bosses and holidaymakers last night warned Brits risk being left behind despite our plummeting death rate and the fact that almost all adults have had at least one vaccine shot. Mr Johnson did say the country was ""looking good"" for domestic unlocking on July 19 but he was downbeat about foreign holidays. Government adviser Professor Robert Dingwall, a public health expert at Nottingham Trent University who sits on the government's Nervtag advisory group, told The Sun last night that it was time to ""stop jumping at shadows"" and give Brits their holiday freedoms back. He said: ""Fully vaccinated people should have freedom of movement, or as much freedom of movement as any other country will allow them. ""We have a persistent misunderstanding of risk. If you're double vaccinated, there is very little risk to you from travelling anywhere else on the planet, because the vaccines would work just as well in Kathmandu as in Kenya. ""The concern is that vaccines do not stop you getting a mild infection with some local variant.",Real Sun,866.0

""There's a failure to think this through from a risk management perspective perhaps rather than a public health perspective."" Prof Karol Sikora, of the University of Buckingham, said: ""It's cruel to ruin everyone's summer holiday for reasons which simply aren't backed up by the science. ""Current travel restrictions will not stop new variants coming in anyway because the actual procedures are not rigorous enough. Cases will inevitably slip through. ""The Government should either shut down the borders completely and not let anyone in, or open up travel for the rest of us. ""It's no good preaching about the risks while allowing world leaders to enjoy a jolly on the beach in Cornwall."" His plea was echoed by senior Conservative MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith, who urged: ""Let's just get this all into some perspective and re-evaluate the risks faced by people."" The former Tory leader warned: ""We cannot totally eliminate the risk but the vaccines should be acknowledged as the game-changer they are. ""There is no reason for the summer to be tough for people who have been double jabbed."" Asked about the proposals to let double-jabbed Brits out of quarantine this morning, Mr Hancock said: ""It is absolutely something we're working on, it's something I want to see. ""We're working on plans to allow the vaccine to bring back some of the freedoms that have had to be restricted to keep people safe. ""We'll get there when it's safe to do so. We want to do this right, we want to do this carefully and properly. ""But of course we do want to get those freedoms back. That's the whole point of the vaccination programme. ""When I'm in a position to be able to say something more concrete then we will do."" A top Public Health England medic also hinted double-vaccinated Brits won't have to isolate after foreign trips in future. Dr Susan Hopkins said there may be ""alternatives to isolation"" for holidaymakers who have received both of their Covid jabs. But she warned that Brits should stick to home holidays this summer.",Real Sun,875.0
118,Real,The Sun,"BORIS Johnson will launch a post-pandemic tidy up of Britain with criminals scrubbing graffiti and chewing gum producers paying to clean streets. A new industry-funded Chewing Gum Taskforce will be unveiled this summer to direct cash to Town Halls to fix up blighted high streets. And The Sun can reveal ministers are finalising plans to use criminals on probation to pick up litter instead of undertaking unpaid work as well as scrub graffiti from railways and busses. Graffiti and gum on the streets said to be a pet peeves of the PM's with ministers told to ""pull every lever"" as part of a bid to get the nation ""sparkling"". One Downing Street insider told The Sun: ""whenever he is driving around the country on visits, he always remarks on the graffiti and mess and says more needs to be done."" The Taskforce is being led from No10 bringing in a wide range of Whitehall departments including the Environment, Communities and Justice. Industry sources say ministers threatened gum producers with taxation if they did not help voluntarily. But so far they have pledged just £2 million - far less than the £100 million needed to clean up the whole country. In 2010 Mr Johnson branded chewing gum ""an awful self-inflicted impetigo on the face of modern London, and it costs a fortune to treat."" ""The manufacturers spend only a couple of pennies to produce every stick or chiclet of gum, yet once they are gobbed on to the pavement and trodden flat by human traffic they adhere with such barnacle-like ferocity that they cost up to £1 each to remove."" Last night Downing Street refused to comment, but confirmed plans to get the high streets spring cleaned would be announced in due course.",Real Sun,292.0
119,Real,The Sun,"LIZ TRUSS was on her fifth coffee of the morning after a night of negotiations with the Australians when Britain's first post-Brexit trade deal was sealed. ""Everyone's a winner"" she declared as she ushered The Sun into her Whitehall lair on Tuesday morning — just moments after Boris Johnson shook on the terms with visiting Aussie PM Scott Morrison in the No10 garden. Since Britain left the EU, ministers have been scrambling to ""roll over"" trade deals Brussels had with other countries — but yesterday's Aussie deal was brand new. The hyperactive Trade Secretary — nicknamed the Duracell bunny — had been up all night powered by wine and espresso as she hammered out the finer details of the historic accord that will save British households up to £34million a year, according to government statistics. ""This is our first post-Brexit deal that we've negotiated from scratch,"" she beamed – ""the first entirely British-shaped deal."" Britain and the Aussies have agreed to scrap all export and import taxes, but beef and lamb tariffs will be phased out over 15 years after a backlash from British farmers and some Cabinet ministers fearing a deluge of cheap meat exports. But the terms of the deal are a big win for the devout free trader Truss and will build on the £13.9billion of trade between the two countries last year. Sitting beneath a giant Australian flag, she hailed ""the most advanced deal Australia has signed, apart from with its closest neighbour New Zealand. ""It really reflects the closeness of our two countries, but it also shows the more outward-facing approach the UK has taken now we're negotiating our own trade deals."" Brexit naysayers said these sort of deals would never be done. Now they say the deal is poor and will do little to make up for lost trade with Brussels. Brexit convert Truss, who voted Remain in 2016, was having none of it. ""Take the North East of England. We're currently exporting 10,000 cars from the North East to Australia every year. And part of this deal is getting tariffs removed on that trade. ""It removes tariffs on all British goods, everything from cars to machinery and clothing."" And she pointed to the 450 businesses in Wales that exported to Australia last year insisting ""life science companies and chemicals manufacturers are set to benefit in particular"". Australia is also the world's eighth largest market for Scotch whisky exports, worth £113million last year. Truss insisted the agreement is a major boon for this industry, too. She says: ""We've also agreed measures to improve sales of Scotch whisky, so every part of the UK benefits from this deal, which will lead to more jobs."" Critics say the deal is small fry as it only boosts UK GDP by 0.02 per cent, but Truss disagrees. She says it is the ""keys"" to Britain's trade leaping on to the emerging markets of Asia. She adds: ""This deal opens the gateway to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which is a huge market. ""By 2030, 66 per cent of the world's middle classes are going to be in Asia, and that is where the opportunities for our farmers, Scotch producers and car markers lie."" Britain is in talks to join the TTP bloc of 11 countries, including Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan and New Zealand. Between them they produce £9trillion of GDP every year. Seeking membership is a key part of Britain's tilt away from Europe to making big trade gains in the East. ""It is a partnership for 500million consumers,"" she explains ""so more consumers than the EU, and they have rising demand for products like beef and lamb. ""This is all about our future opportunities."" But in recent months, Truss has been fighting a battle to get to these zero tariff terms. She was pitted against Environment Secretary George Eustice, who wanted to keep caps on the amount of agricultural goods the Aussies could sell to us. The Conservatives are split between free traders, such as Truss, and protectionists like Eustice, but after blazing Cabinet rows, Boris sided with the former. MPs have dubbed the warring tribes the ""Waitrose Tories"" who want to keep goods local but pricier, versus the ""Lidl Tories"" who want cheap bur- gers and sausages on shelves for the consu- mer to choose. Ever the diplomat, Truss insists ""I shop at both Wait- rose and Lidl"". She uses her local but-cher, too. She also resists the urge to gloat at her victory: ""The PM is a massive proponent of free trade. Of course, George is a winner too,"" she teased with a smirk, ""everyone is a winner"". Yet she has given ground on the transition phase, and admits: ""It's natural that there would be concerns in some quarters, but we have addressed those concerns with a very strong transition period to give our farmers time to adjust."" A Cabinet reshuffle is looming, and with this deal under her belt Truss is in a far stronger position than she was last time Boris rearranged his top team. But she did not shy away from reminding her boss: ""I'm loving this job and this Australia deal is just a start.""",Real Sun,863.0
120,Real,The Sun,"BORIS Johnson is at odds Joe Biden over whether Covid leaked from Chinese lab. Asked by The Sun about the fears the bug escaped from a Wuhan research facility, the PM said: ""At the moment, the advice that we have had is that it doesn't look as though this particular disease of zoonotic origin came from a lab."" He added: ""Clearly, anybody sensible would want to keep an open mind about that."" However the US president did not scotch the claim, saying it was not yet certain whether or not ""a bat interfacing with animals and the environment caused this Covid-19, or whether it was an experiment gone awry in a laboratory"". G7 leaders yesterday renewed calls for a further investigation into the origin of the Covid pandemic amid questions over whether it leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. ""We haven't had access to the laboratories,"" Mr Biden told reporters. Speaking at the Cornish summit on Saturday, the head of the World Health Organisation, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that after almost 3.75 million deaths worldwide, people deserved to know the source of the outbreak.

121,Real,The Sun,"BORIS Johnson will make a major announcement on Monday that June 21's lockdown lifting will be delayed until July 19, The Sun can reveal. A two-week review will be included meaning coronavirus restrictions could be dropped on July 5 if hospitalisations stay down. But sources told The Sun the chances of lifting restrictions as planned on June 21 were close to zero due to a 240 per cent surge in the Indian strain, now known as the Delta variant. This is a huge blow to Wembley's hosting of some crucial Euros matches. Group games will have a 25 per cent stadium cap - 22,500 fans - with that hopefully rising to around 45,000 people for the Semis and the July 11 Final. It had been hoped Wembley could be full of fully vaccinated or tested fans by then, but the delay to the last phase of the roadmap has scotched that. Running the big matches as pilots for Covid certification trials means the capacity numbers can be stretched, but there will still be thousands of seats left empty. Whitehall sources involved in the planning for the delay point to the fact that all UK adults will have been offered at least one jab by the end of July, with a short delay considered far better than having to U-turn and reintroduce restrictions. One source said: ""The last thing they need is a hokey cokey of in out, in out of restrictions. ""No one wants to go backwards, and we have to get this right first go."" The delay will be used to work out if the jab rollout really means rising cases numbers do not spark a surge in hospitalisations - and it will allow millions more people to be double jabbed.

Brits are two-thirds more likely to catch the variant from close contacts - with cases more than tripling in 11 days. Doubling rates for Delta infections were as high as 4.5 days in some parts of England. And 96 per cent of all cases are now due to the new strain. Experts found family members are 64 per cent more likely to be infected with the bug compared to the Alpha or Kent strain. And worrying research suggests the latest strain more than doubles risk of hospitalisation. However, patient numbers have grown at a much slower pace than cases – suggesting the vaccines are currently working to save lives. Just six per cent of all Delta variant infections were in people who had both jabs. More than half of the 42 deaths due to the mutation were in unvaccinated Brits. Dr Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said: ""With numbers of Delta variant cases on the rise across the country, vaccination is our best defence. ""If you are eligible, we urge you to come forward and be vaccinated. Remember that two doses provide significantly more protection than a single dose.

Air Force One touched down at RAF Mildenhall, Suffolk, just before 8pm where Mr Biden, 78, and his wife Gill, 70, addressed US troops as they began their eight-day trip to Europe. Mr Biden said his visit would show that ""the United States is back"" and democracies are standing together.

He is set to meet Mr Johnson today when they will discuss resuming flights. They were stopped more than 400 days ago because of the pandemic. The leaders will also forge a post-Brexit accord focusing on global health, climate change and Covid recovery. It will mirror the Atlantic Charter signed in 1941 by the then British PM and US President, Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Mr Johnson said: ""While Churchill and Roosevelt faced the question of how to help the world recover following a devastating war, today we have to reckon with a very different but no less intimidating challenge — how to build back better from the coronavirus pandemic. ""Co-operation between the UK and US, the closest of partners and the greatest of allies, will be crucial for the future of the world's stability and prosperity."" PRESIDENT Biden would be a disaster for Britain, gleeful Remainers claimed. His Irish ancestry left him ill-disposed to us. He hated Brexit and loved the EU, which he would always prioritise.

Last night a spokesman for the couple declined to comment on a ""private family event"". The only other PM to marry in office was Lord Liverpool who wed Mary Chester in 1822. Boris and Carrie were first seen together at a 2018 fundraiser. They have already become the first unmarried couple to live in Downing Street, moving there in July 2019. He reportedly proposed on holiday on the Caribbean island of Mustique, shortly after his landslide victory at December 2019's General Election. Commons sleazebusters are currently probing who exactly paid for the five-star trip amid a donations row. The engagement — and news that Carrie was expecting their first child — was announced publicly in late February 2020. The pandemic hit weeks later and the PM faced an intensive-care battle with Covid that April. Son Wilfred was born on April 29, 2020, and given the middle name Nicholas after two doctors who saved the PM's life. Mr Johnson has since remained tight-lipped about his wedding plans. Asked this March if he would be tying the knot when lockdown restrictions lift fully, the PM would only say to The Sun: ""The wedding industry is certainly going to come roaring back in common with many other sectors of the economy."" News of the pending nuptials will spark plenty of speculation about where the biggest political wedding in decades will be held. Wilfred was christened at Westminster Cathedral in central London in September. Boris also has access to Chequers, used by Prime Ministers as a retreat since the 1920s, and 40 miles from No10. He quit as Foreign Secretary in July 2018, days after a meeting at the estate in which then-PM Theresa May urged her warring Cabinet to hammer out a Brexit plan. Boris also used Chequers' 1,500 acres to convalesce following his virus battle. A source told The Sun tonight: ""It would be nice for Chequers to be in the news for happy reasons for once."" Looking to read more on the Prime Minister's life? We have you covered... The Port Lympne Reserve and hotel in Kent is also thought to be in the running for next summer's bash. Carrie works for conservation charity the Aspinall Foundation that runs the zoo, home to giraffes, zebras, rhinos and gorillas. The vast reserve also hosts quirky weddings as well as safari tours. Mr Johnson's own country house in his former constituency of Henley, Oxfordshire, could easily have played host to the bash — but it was recently rented out. Commons registers show the farmhouse near Thame is bringing in at least £10,000 a year in rental income. One estate agent's advert offers it for £4,250 a month. The PM also shares a farm and land in Devon with his siblings but it is not thought to be under consideration for the wedding. It had previously been reported that the pair could marry in Italy, where Carrie has relatives. But pals said that would be impractical with travel restrictions for a large party. Another option for the couple could be No10 Downing Street itself. It has plenty of vast state rooms and a large garden that could easily fit hundreds of guests. THE wedding will be the third for Boris — and Carrie's first. He tied the knot with first wife Allegra Mostyn-Owen in 1987. That marriage was annulled in 1993 — the same year he married Marina Wheeler. The couple had four children but separated in 2018. They formally divorced weeks before news emerged of Boris's engagement to Carrie. The only other PM to marry in office was Lord Liverpool who wed Mary Chester in 1822. His first wife Louisa, 54, died the previous year. Boris is also thought to be the first PM to divorce in office since Augustus FitzRoy, the 3rd Duke of Grafton. An act of Parliament allowed him to leave first wife Anne in 1769. He went on to marry Elizabeth Wrottesley and they had 13 children. The couple's flat has been recently renovated, triggering a number of investigations into who paid for the work. Mr Johnson says he met the costs himself, but declined to say who stumped up the original bill, reported to be £38,000.",Real Sun,870.0
128,Real,The Sun,"BORIS Johnson will offer Australia a 15-year transition to an historic zero-tariff, zero-quota trade deal, The Sun can reveal. Trade Secretary Liz Truss has the Cabinet's blessing to ink such a post-Brexit accord with our longstanding ally despite fierce resistance from Britain's farmers. Agriculture has been running sore in the trade negotiations - with the Aussie's pushing for a rapid five year slashing of all import and export taxes on goods. But amid fears our farmers could be undercut by an influx of cheaper Aussie beef and lamb, the decade and half bulwark was agreed by the inner-Cabinet committee in charge of talks. The offer will now be made to the Australian side - with ministerial sources confident an agreement is now in sight despite further haggling to be done on the exact length of the transition. Advocates for the deal say food and wine will get cheaper in British supermarkets when import levies are abolished. But the tariffs on imports and exports on all goods would be ""tapered out slowly"" to allow Brit farmers to adjust after a major row over the deal had erupted. Dubbed the ""battle for the soul of Brexit"" the PM threw his weight behind Cabinet free traders led by Ms Truss in a blow to protectionists Michael Gove and George Eustice who wanted to limit the terms of the deal. Environment Secretary Mr Eustice had been pushing for quotas on meat imports from down under to be included in the deal, but a government source said he was ""left isolated"" with his plea. Brexiteers had argued keeping tariffs and quotas would undermine the point of breaking away from Brussels to strike out with new deals, and Australia should be able to trade on the same terms we trade with the EU. Mr Johnson's trade strategy committee - that included the Foreign and Business Secretaries as well as the Chancellor - are understood to have agreed to include other protections to maintain high standards of farming, but concluded to the ""grand principle"" that the tariff barriers should be dropped. Australia and the UK could now sign the new treaty when their PM Scott Morrison jets to Cornwall next month for the G7 summit. Declining to comment on the details of the meeting, last night No10 said the PM ""wants to maximise the massive opportunities presented by post-Brexit trade deals."" The PM's spokesman insisted that any agreement would include protections for our agriculture industry and won't undercut UK farmers, adding: ""We want a deal that is good for the British public and any agreement would have protection for the agriculture industry.""",Real Sun,435.0
129,Real,The Sun,"BRITAIN and Australia are haggling over a decade long phasing out of all taxes on meat imports amid a major rift in the Cabinet. The two governments are on the cusp of a post-Brexit trade deal but a Whitehall war of words has erupted over claims ""Waitrose Tories"" want to block cheaper food on store shelves. Ministers are under massive pressure from farmers and rich landowners to water down the deal over fears it would be too much competition for Britain's struggling agriculture sector and see a decline in standards. But a row has exploded in Cabinet with supporters of the deal arguing it will slash the price of high quality steaks and burgers in British supermarkets. Oz trade negotiators are pushing for a rapid five year slashing of all import taxes on their beef and lamb heading to our stores. But amid a major backlash from farming unions, Environment Secretary George Eustice backed by ally Michael Gove say it must be at least 15 years and some restrictions could remain even then. But a faction led by Trade Secretary Liz Truss, backed by Brexit guru David Frost and Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, are seeking the blessing tomorrow from Boris Johnson to settle on about 10 years. Allies of the free trade backers were confident they had Mr Johnson onside, but one cautioned BoJo could often change his mind during big set piece showdowns. Ahead of the crunch meeting of the PM's inner-Cabinet committee in charge of trade deals on Thursday, tension bubbled over last night. Supporters of Ms Truss accused Mr Gove and Mr Eustice of being ""more Waitrose than Red Wall"" - claiming their go slow approach will keep prices high for consumers. One Whitehall source said: ""I really don't know why George Eustice even voted for Brexit if he does not want to take advantage of actually leaving the EU."" And last night Mr Kwarteng went public with his concerns, telling the BBC: ""If we can't do a trade deal with Australia, two countries with a shared culture, I think any other deals are looking very challenging."" The business secretary added that he was confident it would be ""a good deal"" and it would be bolstered by a transition of around a decade to give British farmers ""plenty of time to adjust."" But the National Farmers Union said ministers must avoid signing the deal in its current terms and ditch their target of inking it at next month's G7 summit. NFU president Minette Batters said ""If we are taking back control we are taking back control regardless of time limits. Let us take as long as it takes."" ""The British Government faces a choice. It must recognise that opening up zero-tariff trade on all imports of products such as beef and lamb means British farming, working to its current high standards, will struggle to compete."" BREXIT will be a roaring success — only if we grasp its golden new opportunities. So it would be insane not to sign the free trade deal with Australia negotiated by Liz Truss. It is the first that isn't just a tweaked and improved version of what we had under the EU. But it is fiercely resisted by those, some in the Cabinet, who claim imports will harm our farmers. Rubbish. Not only will they have a decade before it is fully implemented — but can they really not compete with Aussie rivals who operate to similarly exacting standards and have to ship their meat 10,000 miles? We must sign this deal and one with New Zealand too. Both will mean cheaper grub for millions. Leaving the EU was about taking back control of our laws, money and borders while opening Britain up to the world for trade. The ""full fat"" Brexit we did handed us total freedom to do so. What a catastrophic signal it will send if ""global Britain"" rejects its first brand-new trade deal and pulls up the drawbridge.",Real Sun,660.0

""Adult entertainment venues"" have been added to stadiums and places with large crowds like nightclubs that will require punters to show proof a jab, negative test or antibodies before entering. Ministers are close to concluding their review into the controversial domestic vaccine certification, with Boris Johnson and lead minister Michael Gove both understood to have moved away from their wider use for pubs and restaurants. Strip clubs are due to open in June according to the PM's lockdown lifting roadmap, but will be slapped with the extra restrictions as they turn on their red lights for the first time since March 2020. The review in Covid papers is due to be published in as little as two weeks time. While ministers are enthusiastically pushing their use - via an updated NHS app - to help sunseeking Brits get abroad this summer, there has been a major backlash to widespread use domestically. The review led by Mr Gove has already made clear that vaccine proof will never been needed for essential shops, medical facilities or places of worship. However there has been a bitter debate in Whitehall at how far they could be used in pubs, bars, clubs and seedier venues. A government source told The Sun: ""The tide has gone out on pubs and restaurants but the reasons for proving you are protected against the virus in venues with much closer contact should be obvious."" Last night Downing Street sources insisted no final decisions on the review had been made and an update would be given by the end of the month.",Real Sun,278.0

Boffins are on board with the plans by the National Economy Recovery Taskforce. Boris Johnson also aims to scrap the work-from-home order. An insider said: ""The current thinking points to social distancing going and mask wearing only in limited settings like buses, trains and the Tube. ""Obviously this is all dependent on final sign-off but the data is looking good and the political will is there for a proper lift-off."" The Sun has learned that the National Economy Recovery Taskforce have discussed a ""maximalist"" approach to lifting ""non-pharmaceutical interventions"" like masks and staying apart everywhere except for a small list of confined places. More unlocking measures, such as meeting indoors, are due on Monday, but social distancing and mask wearing have been kept under separate review. Government scientists are now said to be on board with the taskforce's plans as virus rates plummet while jabs soar. Masks on trains and buses remain an option but possibly without the fines to enforce the measure. Yesterday Boris signalled a return to offices was likely next month. He told the Commons that towns and cities ""depend on people having the confidence on going to work"". He added: ""That is certainly our intention, provided we stay on track. ""I want to be sure we are able to say that with more clarity, a bit later on. We must be guided by what is happening with the pandemic."" Any plans will only get the nod as long as a variant like the one from India does not rip through Britain. Sources say scientific advisers have told the PM that the bug will naturally retreat in the summer, and by winter Britain should be at peak immunity due to the vaccine rollout. Every Brit will be offered a first jab by the end of July, and by the autumn everyone will be double dosed. Some of the most vulnerable could be onto their third.

133,Real,The Sun,"FRIENDS and family will finally be able to hug and kiss from next week — with Boris Johnson revealing today Britain is ""on track"" for a return to normality. Loved ones will be able to hold each other for the first time in months after the Prime Minister confirms Covid-19 rates have sunk low enough to proceed to the next stage of lockdown lifting a week today. The penultimate phase will allow indoor mixing and increase the cap on outdoor get-togethers to 30. ""Friendly contact"" will also get the go-ahead in the first easing of social distancing measures. Hotels can reopen, alongside cinemas and theatres as well as indoor exercise classes. But people will still have to wear masks and stay 1.5 metres apart when meeting indoors unless they are with close family. This morning a cautious SAGE scientists warned that embraces should be kept to a minimum, and Brits should avoid face-to-face contact as much as they can to stay safe. Professor Cath Noakes, who sits on SAGE, has urged caution ahead of the relaxation, warning that too much hugging could ""perpetuate"" Covid's spread. Yet the PM has been warned that it would be ""morally wrong"" to keep such social distancing measures in bars, shops and offices beyond next month. Tory backbencher Steve Baker, from the Covid Recovery Group, an organisation of 50 MPs, claims that it is time now that ""freedom truly means freedom"". Step three of Mr Johnson's recovery plan will kick in next Monday after the latest virus data confirmed plummeting death rates and case levels. Yesterday there were just two confirmed deaths from the bug registered in the UK. Infection rates are at the lowest level since September and hospital admissions and patients continue to decrease or stay at low levels previously seen in July last year. The PM will meet with his Covid war committee on Monday morning to sign off scrapping the Rule of Six outdoors and giving the green-light to mixing indoors. Two households of any size, or six people from separate homes, will be allowed to come together in pubs and homes. Mr Johnson is preparing to address the nation this afternoon to confirm the further easing of restrictions in seven days' time. Last night he said: ""The data reflects what we already knew — we are not going to let this virus beat us. ""The road map remains on track, our successful vaccination programme continues — more than two-thirds of adults in the UK have now had the first vaccine — and we can now look forward to unlocking cautiously but irreversibly. ""It is because of the British public's unwavering commitment that we are saving lives, protecting the NHS and controlling the virus."" And yesterday Cabinet big beast Michael Gove confirmed ""intimate contact"" between family and friends will be restored from the expected May 17 date. He told the BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""All being well, the Prime Minister will confirm that there will be a relaxation. ""We have already indicated a proportionate relaxation on international travel, very limited at this stage because we have to be safe. ""In the same way, as we move into stage three of our road map, it will be the case that we will see people capable of meeting indoors. ""And without prejudice to a broader review of social distancing, it is also the case that friendly contact, intimate contact, between friends and family is something we want to see restored."" But Downing Street is to face growing pressure in the coming days to lift all social distancing restrictions in June. Ministers are currently reviewing the restrictive measures, but they will remain in place until further notice for office workers, shops, bars, pubs and in factories. Yet the fears are that keeping the restrictions risks hampering the economic bounce back from the financially draining pandemic. The Duchess of Cornwall has revealed she enjoyed ""half a hug"" with her grandchildren. Camilla, 73, made the surprise admission despite this being forbidden until Mr Johnson confirms that projected May 17 easing is official. She had spoken last year of the wish she had to hold her grandchildren once more. When asked if she had been able to do that more recently as Britain continues to reopen, she said: ""I have been able to. I have had a hug. I am doubly jabbed so we've had a sort of half a hug. ""It has been so lovely just to be able to see them again and talk to them. ""Telephones and machines and these Zooms are fine, but nothing is ever the same as being able to give somebody a good hug."" BORIS Johnson is set to announce today that hugging will soon be allowed again.

After the SNP fell just short of majority in the Scottish Parliament elections, the Cabinet bigwig swerved questions on whether the Government would use the courts to block her vowed attempt to hold another vote on breaking up the UK. But notably he stopped short of outright rejection of another vote in a significant step back - instead he said now was not the time because of Covid. He told ITV Scotland it was ""not now"" for a second vote. The SNP fell one seat short of an overall majority during the Super Thursday elections, securing 64 seats in Holyrood. Eight seats for the Greens, also pro-independence, paves the way for Scotland to once more hold a vote for independence from Great Britain. But many fear the UK government would not give approval to hold a referendum, with Ms Sturgeon making her feelings clear on what that could mean. She slammed such a scenario as ""no longer a union based on consent"", continuing to the BBC: ""In this election they have voted overwhelmingly for the SNP and we stood on a manifesto commitment to firstly... continue to steer the country through the Covid pandemic. ""But after the crisis to give the people of Scotland the opportunity to choose our own future in a referendum. ""The fact that we are sitting here having a debate about whether or not that outcome is going to be respected says a lot about the lack of respect for Scottish democracy that this UK government has demonstrated for quite some time now."" But Mr Gove said the Scottish First Minister's failure to recapture the dizzy heights of 2011, when her predecessor and now rival Alex Salmond won a healthy 69-seat majority in Edinburgh, indicated there was not a fervour among the public for another independence poll. He told the BBC: ""It is not the case now - as we see - that the people of Scotland are agitating for a referendum."" And he insisted that ""it's not an issue for the moment"" and the SNP's focus on securing a second referendum was ""a slightly skewed set of priorities to imagine that that is the most important issue"". Instead he urged the SNP leader to ""concentrate on recovery"" from the coronavirus pandemic, following the Prime Minister's invitation for her and other devolved leaders to contribute to economic revival plans. Health minister Nadine Dorries also insisted the SNP chief should focus on the promise she made to voters to get on with building back from Covid rather an another ""expensive"" referendum. She said: ""When people asked her in Scotland 'we're not concerned about independence now, what we're concerned about is getting out the pandemic, who should we vote for?' Nicola Sturgeon said vote SNP. ""The recovery is not about legislating for another divisive, expensive referendum. It simply isn't on our radar. ""All we are focused on as a government, and frankly all Scotland should be focused on, is the recovery from the pandemic. ""We are still in the tail end of the pandemic in the UK, the world is still in the grips of this pandemic, we are not out of the woods yet. ""We should not be talking about a referendum, we should be talking about moving forward as a nation and recovering."" Today, Ms Sturgeon said she would be ""delighted"" to attend Boris Johnson's Covid summit, but warned she would push on with plans for another vote when the crisis has passed. With help from the Greens, there are enough separatist votes to get a referendum proposal through the Scottish Parliament, but it cannot go ahead legitimately without approval from Westminster. If the SNP government attempted to go ahead with the vote regardless, it would likely head to the Supreme Court to be rendered illegal. But Sturgeon hit back telling Andrew Marr, that any legal challenge to a referendum from the UK Government would be ""such a grave and serious and undemocratic situation that I don't believe, on either side, anybody wants it to get to that point"". Mr Gove repeatedly avoided saying that Westminster ministers could intervene via the Supreme Court to block legislation from the Scottish Parliament that attempts to engineer a second independence referendum, saying: ""We're not going near there."" But previously senior Tories have vowed to simply say no to another vote at any time. Ms Sturgeon, who said she ""wouldn't rule out"" putting legislation for a referendum before MSPs early next year, claimed a battle in the courts would be ""absurd and completely outrageous"".

Cabinet Secretary Simon Case also tore up Cummings' incendiary blog claims Boris had suppressed a probe into last year's leak to protect a pal of his fiancee Carrie Symonds. Hauled before MPs to explain why no one has been caught five months after the planned November lockdown was leaked early, the newbie mandarin insisted that one had yet been found guilty or cleared. But the head of the civil service was forced to admit the ""source or sources"" may never be found, despite top secret intelligence agency work trying to track them down for months. However Case all but confirmed the security services had been brought into probe the leak, but he admitted no criminal activity or breach of the Official Secrets Act had taken place. However he hinted the methods used to try to snare the 'Chatty Rat' were top secret spy craft, telling MPs he was ""under restraints related to classification."" Case infuriated the MPs during a sometimes painful evidence session, hiding behind classified secrets and ongoing investigations to avoid giving straight answers. The youngest ever Whitehall boss, 42, was compared to a ""badly scripted version"" of hit BBC satire ""Yes, Minister"" after the 130 minute sleaze roasting. Sacked Downing Street aide Mr Cummings claimed in his incendiary ""Nuclear Dom"" blogpost last week that Mr Case had told him last year that he was not a suspect for the leak. But speaking before the Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee Mr Case declined to back up that version of events. Mr Cummings also accused Mr Johnson of wanting to shelve the probe as one of the suspects was Henry Newman, an aide who is a close pal of Ms Symonds. But Mr Case insisted ""at no point has this investigation been in any way de-prioritised, it is in the hands of professional investigators who have a range of tools and techniques at their disposal"". Asked if he accepted what was said in Mr Cummings' blog, Mr Case would only say: ""I am constrained in what I can say because it's in the context of an ongoing investigation."" Probed by Tory MP David Jones if he had authorised Downing Street to tell the media that neither Mr Cummings nor then communications director Lee Cain were the leakers, Mr Case said: ""I am not trying to frustrate, but this is drawing me into details of an ongoing investigation which - for reasons I have set out - I can't go into in this setting."" He said Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle was being updated on the investigation in secret, under Privy Council terms. Committee chairman William Wragg suggested that ""relatively few"" people would have known the information leaked in October ""so it's a rather small pool in which to fish"" in order to find the culprit behind the leak of the lockdown. Mr Case said: ""I'm not trying to frustrate you or other members of the committee on this but we are going here into the details of the investigation and who knew what and this is an area where I am constrained because if I go further on this it will start to reveal the details of the investigation."" But angry MPs on the Committee accused Case of stonewalling, comparing it to satire. Labour's John McDonnell said: ""I don't want to be rude Mr Case but this is coming across as a badly scripted version of 'Yes, Minister'."" And Tory Mr Wragg hit out: ""Mr Case you have known you are coming to this committee for a number of weeks now and there are a number of topical issues… I am surprised you have not been better furnished with the answers to give to the committee.""",Real Sun,650.0
141,Real,The Sun,"DOMINIC Cummings has accused ""incompetent""  Boris Johnson of committing ""possibly illegal"" acts, in a nuclear bomb dropped on Downing Street. No10 had been braced retaliation after they accused the ""bitter"" former aide of leaking embarrassing texts from the Mr Johnson's personal phone. But the Brexit architect stunned Westminster with an incendiary blast branding Mr Johnson's behaviour as ""unethical, foolish, possibly illegal"". Denying some of the accusations levelled against him, Mr Cummings claimed: ""It is sad to see the PM and his office fall so far below the standards of competence and integrity the country deserves."" In a lengthy blog posting he also claimed the Prime Minister had tried to stop an inquiry into the leak last year of plans for a second lockdown because it implicated a friend of his fiancée, Carrie Symonds. He said that he had also warned Mr Johnson against plans to have donors secretly pay for refurbishment of his Downing Street flat, saying they were ""unethical, foolish and possibly illegal"". Yesterday The Cabinet Office confirmed Mr Johnson had met the cost of refurbishments made to the flat himself. However it had been revealed that originally Tory donors had been approached the secure funds. The astonishing row follows Mr Cummings' dramatic departure from No 10 last year amid the fallout from a bitter power struggle with Ms Symonds. All-out war erupted between the Brexit architects after the livid Prime Minister sensationally pointed the finger at his ex-aide for a string of private text messages handed to the BBC. Insiders say Mr Johnson was ""deeply disappointed and saddened"" over his ""suspicion"" that his former senior adviser made public text messages he had sent to a billionaire business chief and the controversial leader of Saudi Arabia in a bid to damage him. All of the leaked messages were received or sent by Mr Johnson during Mr Cummings time in Downing Street, with the PM understood to often share messages with his inner circle. But yesterday Mr Cummings hit back at the claims, denying he had possession of the Dyson texts. He made no mention of the communication with Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman in the fiery statement. His blog post claimed Mr Johnson had ""stopped speaking"" to him about renovations to the Downing Street flat last year. He went on ""I told him I thought his plans to have donors secretly pay for the renovation were unethical, foolish, possibly illegal and almost certainly broke the rules on proper disclosure of political donations if conducted in the way he intended"". ""I refused to help him organise these payments. My knowledge about them is therefore limited,"" Cummings added. ""I would be happy to tell the Cabinet Secretary or Electoral Commission what I know concerning this matter. Last night Mr Johnson told reporters on a campaign stop to Hartlepool, he was ""mystified"" as to why some people have ""chosen to attack"" his communications with Dyson who was trying to help build ventilators. ""I think people aren't so much interested in who is leaking what to whom as the substance of the issue at hand. ""The issue is really the question of the ventilators as you will remember James Dyson was offering to make. Let's be absolutely clear I think it was right to talk to him.""

143,Real,The Sun,"RAGING Boris Johnson has accused his former right-hand man Dominic Cummings of trying to destabilise him with vengeful leaks. Insiders say the PM is ""deeply disappointed and saddened"" that texts he sent were made public. His advisor was forced out of No10 last November. The PM has ordered his staff to cease all contact with his former ally. The man who once pulled the strings in Government as an all-powerful advisor is now suspected of ""treachery"" against the Prime Minister and of being the 'Chatty Rat' behind a series of leaks. Mr Johnson has told allies that Downing Street's soaring poll lead and the success of the vaccine roll-out may have enraged him further. A political row has ignited after text messages sent by Mr Johnson to billionaire business chief James Dyson and a Saudi prince were made public. Whitehall security chiefs launched a formal investigation into the ""damaging"" leaks. But Mr Johnson has only one suspect — and is ""deeply disappointed"" by his attempts to ""undermine"" the Government. A No10 source said: ""The Prime Minister thinks Dominic Cummings is responsible for a series of damaging leaks about his personal communications. ""He is deeply disappointed and saddened by what he thinks his former adviser has been doing and believes he is attempting to undermine the Government and the Conservative Party. ""He fears Dom was responsible for the text message leaks about James Dyson and Mohammed bin Salman."" All of the leaked messages were received or sent by Mr Johnson during Mr Cummings' time at No10, with the PM understood to often share them with his inner circle. Mr Cummings left No10 last November and the top insider added: ""There is a worry that he is bitter about how the government has moved onwards and upwards since his departure."" Downing Street was rocked this week after the BBC revealed texts the PM had sent billionaire Brexit backer Sir James at the height of last year's first Covid wave. Mr Johnson had promised him he would not be slapped with extra taxes if he sent staff to the UK to help build ventilators. The row dominated PMQs on Wednesday, with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accusing the PM of doing favours for those who have his personal mobile number. Sir James, now based in Singapore, had texted the PM last March to say he is ""ready"" to help in the fight against Covid. But he asked for reassurance his staff would not be walloped by a stinging tax bill if they travelled to the UK. The PM replied: ""James, I am first lord of the Treasury and you take it that we are backing you to do what you need."" It came after days of lurid claims of lobbying, sparked by former Tory MP David Cameron's unsuccessful bid to get Treasury loans for toxic firm Greensill Capital. Sir Keir blasted: ""What this shows once again is the extent of the sleaze and the cronyism that is at the heart of his Conservative government."" No10 had initially said there would not be a probe into how the exchange was made public. But a change of course emerged yesterday, when it was announced that an internal inquiry will be led by the Cabinet Office. Downing Street has said it will officially publish correspondence between Mr Johnson and Sir James ""shortly"". The PM also told the Commons he was ""happy to share all the details"" of the exchanges. It came just two weeks after another leak of text messages from Mr Johnson's personal phone appeared in the media. They showed Saudi Arabia's controversial Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had urged the PM to ""correct"" the Premier League's decision to block his £300million Newcastle United takeover bid. Messages revealed Mr Johnson then asked another senior aide to investigate the matter in July 2020. Last night, Mr Cummings did not respond to the incendiary accusation that he had leaked the texts. He and Mr Johnson were once the closest of allies — winning the historic 2016 Brexit vote together, taking over the party and crushing Labour in the 2019 election. However their relationship turned sour after Mr Cummings' infamous lockdown-breaking trip to Durham's Barnard Castle in April 2020. A toxic Downing Street turf war then erupted last November that pitted Mr Cummings against Mr Johnson's fiance Carrie Symonds. The Brexit hardliner was eventually forced out and has been lying low ever since, occasionally tweeting his thoughts on the government. Critics said the string of leaks - especially between foreign leaders and No10 - could pose a risk to national security. Security think-tank the Henry Jackson Society called for urgent action against the leaker. Boss Alan Mendoza hit out: ""This string of leaked private messages from the PM's phone could constitute a national security risk. ""The government needs to urgently investigate who is obtaining them and for what purpose they're leaking them."" Senior MPs also hit out at the security around Mr Johnson's phone, as he has had the same number for more than a decade.

The renovations were completed earlier this year but the special high tech room will now only be used by ministers after the expensive u-turn. Mr Johnson had hired ex-ITV News journalist Allegra Stratton as the face of his Washington inspired daily press operation. But last night she was instead appointed his climate change spokesman ahead of November's landmark Cop26 summit in Glasgow. In February The Sun revealed the soaring costs of the new TV renovations next door to the PM's office in 9 Downing Street. Plan for on camera briefings three times a week was quietly iced after Mr Johnson got cold feet on the idea during the recent lockdown. Bitter rows over Ms Stratton's appointment had helped trigger the downfall of Mr Johnson's powerful aide Dominic Cummings and chief spin-doctor Lee Cain in furious Downing Street civil war late last year. Since then the state of the art studio has only been used for a handful of Covid press conferences. The revamped briefing room is modelled on Washington's West Wing but had been criticised as too lavish and expensive. Last night one source told The Sun: ""The daily briefings had always been a recipe for a disaster, it just took a little while for everyone to come round to that.""

145,Real,The Sun,"NANNYING health chiefs are to slap calorie counts on pints ordered in pubs, leaked plans seen by The Sun reveal. Matt Hancock's Health department has horrified Cabinet colleagues with orders to force bigger pub chains to reveal the amount of calories in all beer, wine and spirit served in their bars. Menus or even pump labels would have to carry the information. The push would also see all alcohol sold in shops have to publish calorie information and a health warning by law. All pre-packaged booze labels would have warnings about drinking from Professor Chris Whitty, as well as the risks of drink-driving and the amount of calories. The Government's own figures say that there will be a £92 million hit to the already Covid-ravaged booze industry - but ""the benefits to consumers has not been quantified"". Public Health Minister Jo Churchill has told colleagues she wishes to launch a 12-week consultation on the plans. They would force any business with 250 or more people to publish the calorie information about drinks - meaning the change in the law would hit most major pub chains. Churchill points to the fact that 7-8% of drinkers' calorie intake come from booze, with lower socio-economic households and those already overweight benefiting the most from the policy. But last night critics slammed the plans as ""madness"" saying they would be a hammer blow to an already struggling part of the economy.

Ex-SNP star Margaret Ferrier, 60, was condemned for making the 700-mile round trip to Westminster while suffering from the bug in September. Now, expenses claims published by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority show that she charged the taxpayer £175 for her overnight hotel stay. The claim shows her paying for three nights in a central London hotel but getting a refund for the cost of two nights after she tested positive and dashed back up north. The claim is within the rules but likely to spark uproar. Ms Ferrier made the journey on September 28 despite displaying symptoms of the virus and spoke for four minutes in the Commons. She tested positive that evening but still stayed at a hotel in London before getting the train back to Glasgow the next day. Ms Ferrier was booted out of the SNP by leader Nicola Sturgeon when the scandal broke last year and was arrested in January for putting lives at risk.

Facebook, Google and Twitter face fines of billions unless they take action now — with Whitehall drawing up laws that could take ten per cent of their global revenue unless they do more. Mr Dowden said he held ""shocking"" chats with players, including Sun columnist Troy Deeney, and it was clear that abuse has migrated from ""the stands to social media"". He said inaction could cast a shadow over the decade of football ahead in which the UK hosts Euro matches this summer and the Women's Euros come here next year, and we bid for the 2030 World Cup. He added the time had come for firms to ""deploy their brilliant engineers"" to strip the sites of hate. His call in The Sun comes after a government race relations report sparked a row by concluding that the country is a ""beacon"" to the world. Dr Tony Sewell wrote in his report: ""We no longer see a Britain where the system is deliberately rigged against ethnic minorities."" The report did say that social media firms don't do enough to tackle racism. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called its findings disappointing. And race campaigners rejected the dossier, saying it failed to take into account the ""lived experience"" of many Brits. By Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden Sadly, racism in football seems to have moved from the stands to social media. I recently spoke to a group of footballers, including Sun columnist Troy Deeney, to hear directly about the abuse they face and what they'd like their Government to do about it. They were very open, and it was shocking to hear about the racist abuse they deal with on a daily basis. As Thierry Henry said, this situation is too toxic to ignore - and I'm determined to tackle it. After a terrible couple of seasons due to Covid, we should be looking forward to a golden decade of football. The enthusiasm of the post-lockdown kickoff on Monday shows the strength of the grassroots. The women's game is flourishing. We are building better all-weather facilities in every corner of the country. We will be proud hosts of the Euros this summer and the Women's Euros next, and we are starting exploratory work on our bid for the World Cup in 2030. So let's not allow online abuse to tarnish our game. Let's not force footballers to choose between either engaging with their fans and having to see racist comments all hours of the day, or come off social media altogether. We've been working on new laws to make the online world safer. It's complex, and we have to get it right, and ensure freedom of expression. But I firmly believe we can have a free and open internet without hateful, racist comments going unchecked. Companies have a clear picture of what our laws will do. They can deploy their brilliant engineers right now to stop racist remarks being posted and shared. I believe them when they say they want their platforms to be positive and safe places.

WE almost feel sorry for Keir Starmer. There he is, maintaining the fiction that he has moved Labour on from Corbyn, when a leftie shadow minister is caught branding business ""the enemy"". The reality is that far too many Starmer MPs are just thinly-disguised Corbynites. Their adolescent politics align them instinctively with every fashionably woke or anti-capitalist cause, no matter how toxic with voters. And, let's face it, Starmer — who campaigned devotedly to install the old Marxist in No10 — is not immune either. Which may explain why Labour, opposing a Government engulfed by the gravest crisis since 1940, is nose-diving in the polls. ""That is still my dream, but we haven't got time to do that and save the climate."" The Hartlepool by-election will be a key test of Sir Keir's leadership. The May 6 contest will give an indication of whether the Labour leader can shore up support in the party's former industrial heartlands after large sections of the so-called ""red wall"" crumbled in the 2019 general election.",Real Sun,309.0
156,Real,The Sun,"POLITICIANS sanctioned by China have suffered a crippling cyber attack just days after being hammered by Beijing, The Sun can reveal. A group of MPs and Lords campaigning for tougher global action against the Communist superpower were hit by an attack on their website's server - now being probed by spooks. IPAC, the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, saw their website taken offline on Monday evening in a mysterious digital blitzkrieg. The group includes ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith and former minister Nusrat Ghani - who were both slapped with personal sanctions by Beijing last week. Now IPAC have turned to GCHQ's National Cyber Security arm to boost their online protection. The culprits have yet to be identified but key figures in the group have pointed the finger firmly at Beijing-backing hackers and vow they will not be silenced. Relations between Britain and China sunk to a new low last week after the Eastern powerhouse banned a number of critical MPs and peers from entering the country. Their crime is accusing the Communist regime of genocide against the Muslim Uighur population in Xinjiang. Beijing retaliated after Britain, the US, Canada and the EU introduced restrictions on Monday on Chinese officials responsible for abuses in the province. Last night IPAC's coordinator Luke de Pulford told The Sun: ""This isn't the first time we have been attacked. ""But – while Beijing's mysterious supporters might be able to knock us off the internet for a few hours – nothing will stop our members standing up for the Uyghurs, Hong Kongers, and everyone else oppressed by China."" Last night the National Cyber Security Centre said: ""We understand the website is now running as normal.

157,Real,The Sun,"BORIS Johnson's alleged use of an ultra-secretive messaging app that destroys texts after sending faces a courtroom challenge. Last year The Sun revealed the PM had joined Signal, the most secure digital communication app on the open market, alongside a host of other ministers and officials. It gives users the option of being able to self-destruct their messages within a set period of time, from a week down to just five seconds. Disappearing messages are liked by senior Government figures because they help limit leaks. But transparency campaigners fear it is a loophole to avoid scrutiny from  Freedom of Information laws and are threatening legal action. The law states all such communications must be retained forever like emails but there are growing concerns ministers and aides are bypassing this by using the self-destructing instant messages. A spokesperson for campaign group Citizens claims: ""Government business is being conducted under a cloak of secrecy enabled by the tech platforms."" They added: ""This entire period of British history is going to be one giant black hole. We are in an unprecedented national emergency and we are going to have no records of how decisions were made or even who made them."" They have joined forces with anti-big tech group Foxglove as they mull legal action. Their boss Cori Crider said: ""We're deeply concerned by this government's approach to data - it seems to involve collecting more and more information on all of us, while we have less and less information on our own representatives. "" And she threatened: ""Privacy is for the people – transparency is for the government. And if we have to sue to tip the scales back in favour of the citizen, so be it."" The campaigners have given ministers 14 days to give a clear explanation of how the secret messages are monitored and stored - and accessible by FoI - or they will begin Judicial Review proceedings. Asked about the PM's social media habits his spokesman said last night: ""We abide by all the relevant data laws. We are transparent."" They added: ""We of course abide by the FoI laws to ensure that any questions asked are responded to in a timely fashion."" FAR too much Downing Street business is done in secret. That has worsened since everyone from the PM down began using Signal, a highly-encrypted messaging app which automatically deletes texts. It means hugely important conversations — about policy failures, or maybe worse — are impossible for the public or Press to scrutinise via Freedom of Information requests or even court order. It is a licence for cover-ups. The Sun revealed this practice last May. Now the Government faces a legal challenge — and we hope it succeeds. Ministers do need to secure  communications against hostile states' hackers. But they must be accountable too for how critical decisions are arrived at. That is not possible if no one can ever prove who said what and to who.",Real Sun,491.0
158,Real,The Sun,"AN online junk-food ads ban is to be axed as it would have almost no effect on obesity. The proposal would cut a child's annual calorie intake by just 700 — equivalent to four packets of crisps. Following a review, Whitehall insiders say ministers now accept that a boycott would be ""disproportionate"" as it would cost businesses tens of millions. PM Boris Johnson backed an online crackdown following his battle with Covid, saying he and the nation were too fat. But food and drink manufacturers said the proposal was flawed and would banish adverts for family favourites such as Marmite and mustard. A letter from firms behind 3,000 brands said there would be many unintended victims. They asked if it was really the plan to stop, for example, a wedding cake maker from sharing product details on its Instagram account to grow its sales. Campaigners welcomed the impending climbdown which would also have stopped pubs struggling with Covid from putting menus on social media. The Adam Smith Institute said: ""It's right the Government has realised the plan to ban online ads for Great Britain's food heroes was well and truly mad. ""It's a commonsense victory for every local bakery, coffee shop, pub, chippy and curry house."" WHAT took the Government so long to scrap the ludicrous proposed ban on online ads for fast food? The scientific evidence showed it would cut a child's daily calories by about two . . . that's a biscuit crumb. All at a monstrous cost to businesses. The Sun pointed this out last November. It shows the power of the nanny-state lobby that this mad idea wasn't immediately laughed out of the room. But we welcome No10 seeing the light now. How about applying the same common sense to other failed measures? Like the sugar tax, which won't trim an ounce off anyone's weight.

When lockdown began to be eased last May, the very effective slogan ""Stay home, protect the NHS, save lives"" was replaced by the confusing ""Stay alert, control the virus, save lives"". But people complained it was meaningless and even dangerously muddled.

Boris Johnson ordered everyone to stay at home once again in January, but 29 March sees a slow return to freedoms. The next stage of the lockdown easing roadmap will see a return of the rule of six or two households able to mix in outdoors and in gardens. With the prospect of BBQs in gardens and picnics in parks this Easter bank holiday weekend, a TV and radio advertising blitz has been scheduled to remind people its outdoors only.

160,Real,The Sun,"BORIS Johnson should have used sweeping civil contingencies powers to cut out Nicola Sturgeon from the Covid response, Cabinet colleagues claim. And a year on, some around the top table say the PM regrets his decision not to do so. Ahead of Tuesday's anniversary of the first Lockdown, The Sun can reveal a major rift at the top of government last March over how to respond to the emerging pandemic. The PM was urged by some ministers and aides not to use 1980s Public Health laws to respond - as Health matters are devolved meaning Edinburgh and Cardiff  were given the chance to go their own way in response. Instead they wanted Mr Johnson to rely on the doomsday 2004 Civil Contingencies Act which gave Whitehall supreme authority for a ""catastrophic emergency"". Insiders say the issue was raised multiple times at Cobra and around the Cabinet table. At one tense early meeting it is understood Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg was particularly vocal at using the sweeping Act rather than writing a new law for Covid that sat alongside the 1984 Public Health Act. However Downing Street were said to be concerned that extreme Civil Contingencies powers would have to be approved by MPs every 30 days, whereas writing a new law gave them emergency control for a whole year. Mr Johnson opted for the special Coronavirus Act 2020 instead that also gave the police massive powers, suspended elections and paved the way for the furlough scheme. But insiders say they were blindsided by the fragmented response to the bug across the four nations of the United Kingdom. Scotland and Wales have been able to set their own lockdown measures and easing timetables as a result - at times creating tension with Westminster. The Scottish first minister has been openly critical of the UK government's response for England, infuriating Whitehall. Not only did the decision lead to confusing different rules for different parts of country,  it also saw Nicola Sturgeon's poll ratings rocket. A former aide who has now left government told The Sun: ""At the time I think everyone just assumed there would be a joined up response across the whole country and we didn't really think at the time it would splinter. ""But obviously that turned out to be wrong and was pretty naive."" ""I have no doubt that it will be done differently next time. The PM knows that."" A Cabinet Minister said: ""I have no doubt that it will be done differently next time. The PM knows that."" Others around the Cabinet table agree, but another added that ""hindsight is a wonderful thing."" They insisted: ""It was bonkers back then so no one is to blame."" Asked if Mr Johnson had any regrets, Downing Street insisted that their customised Covid law was needed as their response to the crisis was so broad. A Government spokesperson said: ""Without the Coronavirus Act, the most crucial support and interventions such as the furlough scheme and people claiming Statutory Sick Pay and other benefits would not have been able to continue during the pandemic, as well as other public services including virtual court hearings.""

161,Real,The Sun,"CHILD rapists, terrorists and serious criminals as well as failed asylum seekers will be stopped from exploiting modern slavery safeguards to stay in Britain. And lefty lawyers who help them face a major clampdown and punishing costs for wasting court time. Asylum appeals will be ""expedited"" too to stop delays in deportations. The landmark Modern Slavery Act was designed in 2014 to protect vulnerable people being trafficked but is regularly used without merit to delay the expulsion from the UK of serious criminals. The number of people claiming to have suffered it has doubled since 2017 and 2020 from 5,141 to 10,613. Home Secretary Priti Patel tells The Sun today criminals and terrorists are ""diverting resources away from genuine victims of trafficking, persecution and serious harm – which is completely unacceptable."" Upcoming reforms to the asylum system due to be unveiled on Wednesday will stop deportees being able to frustrate their removal using Modern Slavery laws. And its protection is to be withheld from dangerous criminals who have received prison sentences of over a year, as well as individuals who pose a threat to national security. The reforms will also tackle spurious last minute legal challenges to pull illegal immigrants off deportation planes. The Home Office wants to use the new Sovereign Borders Bill to target ""dinghy-chasing"" firms with strict rules similar to the Fixed Recovery Costs faced by  accident lawyers. Instead of long haggles over costs for cases, there will be a flat fee for unsuccessful bids. And judges will have the power to slap massive costs on have-a-go lawyers who use template papers and every excuse they can think of to try to stop deportations without merit. They will have to sign up to a ""good faith"" agreement promising not to use false or jumped up excuses not to expel failed asylum seekers. If they breach it they face newly toughened ""Wasted Costs Orders"". A government source said last night: ""Cases will be heard fairly, they just won't be heard over and over again. ""Some of the tactics some law firms use to keep people with no right to be here in the country are scandalous and we want to make sure they, not taxpayers pick up the bills."" The Home Secretary told The Sun: ""Our generous safeguards for victims are being rampantly abused by child rapists, people who pose a threat to national security and failed asylum seekers with no right to be here.

Dr Williams tweeted: ""Am I the only one to read the sentence containing Liam Fox, burglary and young man in spare room to think of a scene in Withnail and I?""

""They were from a decade ago, which doesn't diminish the fact that they were wrong, but I want to reassure people that I wouldn't dream of making comments like this now.""

165,Real,The Sun,"NICOLA Sturgeon is facing mounting calls to resign after she was found to have misled the Scottish Parliament in her war with Alex Salmond. The Scottish First Minister was being investigated by a Holyrood committee that has ruled by a 5 to 4 majority that she was not truthful in her evidence given to them. Heaping pressure on Ms Sturgeon to quit, they found she misled the committee itself and therefore misled parliament and potentially breached the ministerial code of conduct. But it's likely she will try to avoid having to resign because it does not accuse of her of being ""knowingly dishonest"". However the findings are a major embarrassment for the Scottish National Party leader on the eve of crucial Scottish Parliament elections. The Tories and Labour both say that in misleading parliament, she has breached the ministerial code of conduct. Tonight, Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross stepped up his calls for Ms Sturgeon to resign. ""We cannot set a precedent that a First Minister of Scotland can mislead the Scottish Parliament and get away with it,"" he said. ""We have to trust that the First Minister will be truthful. We no longer can."" In a statement on Twitter, he added: ""We have called out the First Minister based on overwhelming evidence that she misled Parliament. ""We will continue to hold her to the same standards as previous First Ministers of Scotland and demand that she resigns."" Former first ministers have quit over far smaller incidents of breaching the rule book but Ms Sturgeon will try tough out the row. She appeared before the committee last month giving evidence in both writing and in person claiming she had not offered to intervene in a harassment probe into alleged bad behaviour by her predecessor Mr Salmond. But he blew that claim out of the water by testifying the opposite, and was backed up by his legal team who were present at meetings with Sturgeon. Duncan Hamilton QC, his legal adviser said he heard Sturgeon tell Salmon in 2018: ""If it comes to it, I will intervene."" The report is expected to be formally published next week but its key finding was leaked tonight. Ms Sturgeon's spokesman hit back: ""It is clear from past public statements that opposition members of this committee had prejudged the First Minister at the outset of the inquiry and before hearing a word of her evidence, so this partisan and selective briefing - before the committee has actually published its final report - is hardly surprising."" It comes after senior Tory MP David Davis claimed a top aide knew about the allegations two months before the First Minister claimed she found out. Mr Davis said he knew of messages between top civil servants from February 2018 which suggested Ms Sturgeon's chief of staff Liz Lloyd had ""interfered"" in the internal investigation of Mr Salmond. He also said a whistleblower passed him messages between senior SNP officials, including Mrs Sturgeon's husband Peter Murrell. Mr Davis said those messages suggest a ""concerted effort"" to encourage complaints about Mr Salmond.

Plans to force drivers over to electric cars risk being fatally undermined if low-income families are unable to pay for the charging points needed, according to the Social Market Foundation. From 2030 the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans will be banned as ministers try to accelerate the switch to electric vehicles - currently one in ten cars sold is electric. But the plans will need 600,000 charging points installed across Britain outside homes, on streets in car parks and at workplaces. But renters and the lower paid look set to miss out without support. And resentment to the high price of going green could derail the whole agenda. The SMF think tank say: ""The perception of unfairness is a grave threat to the mass adoption of electric vehicles."" And they argue ""if the costs and disruption of the EV transition fall too heavily on people who feel no benefit – because they cannot afford an EV or access convenient and affordable charging for one – public consent for Net Zero will be dangerously weakened."" They cite polling from Opinium that shows while 35pc of richer voters object to meeting the cost of charging points, that soars to 47pc of the lowest paid voters. 57pc of rich back the petrol and diesel ban, compared to 43pc of lower social class voters. Industry chiefs warn going green will remain the preserve of ""leafy suburban avenues"" without a major rethink.

And she added that there is ""no perfect solution"" for exam results this year but that teacher assessments were ""a good attempt at creating the best we can do in very, very unsatisfactory circumstances"". It came as the Education Secretary said proposed changes to the summer holidays and longer school days were being considered for helping pupils catch up on lost learning during the pandemic. Summer holidays could be slashed with a five-term year and longer school days in the biggest reform since the Second World War. Mr Williamson said education catch-up tsar Sir Kevan Collins was looking at ""a whole range of different proposals"" And he vowed the government would be ""enhancing support to teachers and making sure they can be the very best of themselves."" Speaking ahead of schools reopening, Mr Williamson said the education sector was ""leading the way"" He told the BBC: """"This is our first step, our real first step in terms of moving out of national lockdown and it is our schools that are leading the way."" ""We are very much factoring in as part of the road map that actually schools will be staying open. ""That is why we are taking a cautious approach because we intend for it to be an irreversible approach and that schools will continue to remain open."" And he gave a guarantee that schools would return again after the Easter holidays, saying that would always be the government's intention. Despite the pivotal role teachers have played in the pandemic and easing of lockdown, Mr Williamson used his Sunday morning tour of the TV studios to confirm they would not be getting a pay rise like nurses. He told Sky News: ""What we all recognise is that this is a period of making sure we have restraint right across the public sector. ""But we aren't nervous about investing in those key public services such as the NHS, such as schools."" Defending the teachers pay freeze, he added: """"We saw this year the largest pay increase for teachers since 2005. ""But there is going to be pay restraint, there is going to be a pay freeze for the coming year but we are continuing to invest in schools.""",Real Sun,812.0

Asked about Royal dramas due to be broadcast at 1am UK time, Mr Johnson said it was too late for him to stay up and it was ""unlikely"" he would watch it on catch-up as he was too busy rolling out the Covid jab. Speaking on a vaccine visit in Brent, Northwest London, the PM said ""of course I'm interested in all sorts of stuff around the world."" But he added: ""It's quite late our time so I'll probably miss it and I'll be focussing, as I'm sure you would expect and the people of the country would expect, I'm focusing on rolling out the vaccine."" Downing Street sources say Mr Johnson will be fully briefed on the developments and accusations made by Meghan and Harry first thing on Monday morning. Asked if he would be ""setting the Sky+ box"" to record the turbulent event instead, the PM quipped: ""I think it unlikely. We're focusing on the vaccine rollout and economic recovery."" Meanwhile Education Secretary Gavin Williamson declared ""the whole nation stands up for the Queen"" in the Royal soap opera.

But the government could yet u-turn on to to see off a strike, Gavin Williamson hinted. The Education Secretary said the offer was ""part of a process"" but added ""no one wants to see a industrial action."" Mr Williamson stressed NHS workers the only part of the public sector to see any rise this year because of a ""period of restraint"" sparked by £407 billion of pandemic spending. Mr Williamson said on Sunday morning TV that that the Department of Health had ""put forward what we believe we can afford"" for nurses during ""difficult economic challenges"". He stressed teachers and others in the public sector will face a pay freeze, with NHS staff the only group to be exempted following their efforts during the crisis. Speaking on a visit to a vaccine hub in Northwest London shortly after, the PM added he was ""massively grateful to all NHS staff"" insisting ""what we have done is tried to give them as much as we can."" Mr Johnson said: ""the independent pay review body will obviously look at what we've proposed and come back."" ""Don't forget that there has been a public sector pay freeze - we're in pretty tough times - we've tried to give the NHS as much as we possibly can, and that means in addition to the £140bn annual money we've got another £62bn that we've found to help support the NHS throughout the crisis."" But Labour have branded the offer ""reprehensible"" and nurses unions are mulling a walk out. Dame Donna Kinnair, Chief Executive and General Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ""Boris Johnson is still failing to understand the situation he has stumbled into - more of these warm words for nurses are not going to cut it."" She warned: ""The prime minister must put his money where his mouth is."" Mr Williamson told Sky News: ""What we all recognise is that this is a period of making sure we have restraint right across the public sector. ""We're facing almost three-quarters of a million people who are unemployed and we have in the context of that decided to exempt the NHS from the public sector pay freeze, which is the only part of the public sector that has been exempted from that."" And speaking to the BBC he left the door open to a climbdown, adding: ""We've put forward what we believe we can afford and is part of a process and that is what will be looked at."" But Labour frontbencher hit back Lisa Nandy said the rise recommended by ministers to the independent pay bodies amounts to a ""real-terms pay cut"" as it will be outflanked by inflation. The opposition say a newly-qualified nurse earning a £24,907 salary would face a real-terms cut to the tune of £174 if the rise goes ahead. Ms Nandy told Sky News: ""The Government, to be clear, is not planning a pay rise. ""That is a real-terms pay cut because it doesn't keep up with inflation, and for nurses to be offered a pay cut is just reprehensible in our view.

And killer drivers who were under the influence of drink or drugs will also be able to be locked up for life. The current maximum sentence for each crime is 14 years. The idea was first suggested in 2015, and more than two thirds of respondents backed it when it was put to public consultation a year later. Last year Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said: ""This government has been clear that punishments must fit the crime, but too often families tell us this isn't the case with killer drivers."" The new bill will also double the maximum sentence for assaulting an emergency worker from 12 months to 2 years. It will also toughen up early release for dangerous criminals and terrorists.

178,Real,The Sun,"JOE Biden has paused Donald Trump's tariffs on whisky exports to the United States in a half a billion pound Brexit bonanza. The US slapped crippling 25pc taxes on British exports like Scotch or JCBs in 2019 in a row with the EU over aeroplane parts. Research by the Scotch Whisky Association research shows it has cost the industry more than £500million so far in lost business. But free from Brussels, Liz Truss negotiated a new deal with the White House that will see the punishing tariffs suspended from Monday. It's a massive boost for Scottish industry - and will also boost exports of cashmere and cheese. The UK exported £340million of single malt to the US in 2018, as well as £60million of construction vehicles and £45million worth of cheese. The UK and US governments have today committed to ""a joint de-escalation"" of the long-running dispute between aerospace giants Airbus and Boeing. Britain suspended tariffs on Boeing parts last December in a good will gesture. On Monday, the United States will temporarily suspend all retaliatory tariffs on direct exports from the UK to the US resulting from the Airbus dispute for four months, in an effort to reach a negotiation solution to the 16-year long row. Trade bosses say the move will help struggling producers protect jobs in Scotland, where the Scotch industry supports 50,000 workers, with whisky tariffs being slashed from 25% to zero. Scotch was the UK's largest food and drink export in 2020. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said today: ""From Scotch whisky distillers to Stilton-makers, businesses across the UK will benefit from the US decision today to suspend tariffs in this dispute. ""It shows what the UK can do as an independent trading nation, striking deals that back our businesses and support free and fair trade. ""I now look forward to strengthening the UK-US relationship, as we drive economic growth and build back better together."" From Scotch whisky distillers to Stilton-makers, the US decision to suspend tariffs on some UK exports today will benefit businesses right across the UK. Fantastic news as we strengthen the UK-US trading relationship and work to build back better from the pandemic. https://t. co/p5XO8RTA9T Trade boss Liz Truss said today: ""I am delighted to say that our American allies – under their new President and his hard-working staff at the US Trade Representative - have embraced our move to seek a fair settlement. ""This is Global Britain in action: securing new opportunities as a newly nimble nation. ""And the benefits will be felt across our nation, especially in Scotland, as Scotch whisky, the UK's largest food and drink export in 2020, will be even better value for consumers in the United States, its most valuable market. ""The easier it is for Americans to buy a bottle of Macallan, Talisker or Glenmorangie, the more money those producers will have to invest in their businesses, their staff and futures. This news shows– put simply – that trade equals jobs."" Ms Truss also cited the benefits for cashmere producers in Ayrshire, who export goods worth £12million to the US annually, and English cheesemakers. The UK and US are continuing to work towards an ambitious trade deal, which could eliminate almost £500million in tariffs on UK exports to the US. Chief Executive of the Scotch Whisky Association Karen Betts hailed the news today. She said: ""This is fabulous news, and our industry is delighted. ""The tariff on Single Malt Scotch Whisky exports to the US has been doing real damage to Scotch Whisky in the sixteen months it has been in place, with exports to the US falling by 35%, costing companies over half a billion pounds.

180,Real,The Sun,"FEARS were today sparked of ANOTHER national lockdown as the furlough scheme is extended until September. According to Boris Johnson's lockdown plan, all Covid restrictions should be lifted by June 21. However, Rishi Sunak today revealed the government's furlough scheme had been extended until the end of September in his Budget - three months after all Brits were told the pandemic would be over. The Budget announcement means millions will have been paid to stay at home for 17 months by the end of the furlough scheme. The government will continue to pay furloughed workers' wages up to a maximum of £2,500 a month until the end of June. Employers will then be required to meet 10 per cent of those wages in July and 20 per cent in August and September as the scheme winds down. Mr Sunak told the Commons today: ""The furlough scheme will be extended until the end of September, there will be no changes to the terms. ""As businesses reopen, we'll ask them to contribute alongside the taxpayer to the cost of paying their employees. ""Nothing will change until July, when we will ask for a small contribution of just 10% and 20% in August and September."" But Brits took to social media concerned with the move, with one writing: ""Furlough ending in September… we're not being released in June are we!?! Lockdown 4.0 is imminent."" Another added: ""Furlough extended? Hello Lockdown 4.0."" A third wrote: ""They've just extended the furlough scheme until September. ""If we're lifting all restrictions on the 21st of June, why would we need a furlough scheme? Don't be surprised to see us in lockdown 4 by the 21st of June"" The Chancellor's vow ""to do whatever it takes"" to protect jobs and support businesses will add £5billion a month to the pandemic's £280billion support bill. But he also warned today that the time to get the nation's books in order is rapidly approaching. Mr Sunak is gambling on buying some time to allow the economic recovery to strengthen in order to weather the unemployment hit. The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has protected more than 11million jobs since its creation last March, with Mr Sunak promising further help in the ""challenging months ahead — and beyond"". Employees taking part will continue to receive 80% of their salary — up to a maximum £2,500 a month — for hours not worked until the scheme ends. Today's Budget also extended the Universal Credit uplift of £20 for six months and business support measures such as five per cent VAT for pubs and restaurants. The Chancellor also announced further support for the self-employed, with more than 600,000 people eligible for cash. A fourth grant from the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme is available from April, worth 80 per cent of three months' average trading profits up to £7,500. In his speech to MPs, Mr Sunak promised to help struggling workers with the ""full measure of our fiscal firepower"" but warn that the time is approaching to ""begin fixing the public finances"". He vowed to use every means ""to protect jobs and livelihoods"". But Mr Sunak is staring at a £400billion black hole created by the Covid crisis. He set out ""a three-point plan to protect jobs"" but also gave a reality check over the dire economic situation. The Treasury said the Budget will focus on ""support, honesty and building the future economy"". Mr Sunak told MPs: ""Once we are on the way to recovery, we will need to begin fixing the public finances — and I want to be honest today about our plans to do that."" It is hoped some of the money will be clawed back through a hike in corporation tax on businesses and capital gains taxes on millionaire second property owners and investors. Mr Sunak has also frozen the rates at which workers start to pay different levels of income tax, meaning more people will be caught in a higher band over the coming years. Last week, The Sun revealed he had been warned the deficit needs reducing by around £30-40billion now to stabilise borrowing and prevent debt from rising as a percentage of national income. THE Budget is when the government outlines its plans for tax hikes, cuts and things like changes to the minimum wage. It's different to the Spending Review, which sets out how much public cash will go towards funding certain departments, devolved government's and services, such as the NHS. The Budget is read out in the House of Commons by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It will be Rishi Sunak's second Budget as Chancellor. Mr Sunak's first one in March last year has been dubbed the ""coronavirus Budget"" after it focused on supporting Brits financially through the crisis, rather than the government's ""levelling up"" agenda as promised in the 2019 general election. Normally, the Budget is held once a year but the unprecedented circumstances of the pandemic in 2020 saw Mr Sunak give a ""mini-budget"" in the Commons on July 8 The CBI's chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said extending the furlough scheme will keep ""millions more in work and give businesses the chance to catch their breath"".

They are furious over China's infringement of Hong Kong, Uighur slave camps and lying to the world about the outbreak Covid-19. Mr Johnson's pro-China rhetoric came amid growing confusion in Whitehall over whether the UK is pursuing a trade deal with the communist state or not. Business minister Lord Grimstone told peers in January: ""China is an important trading partner for the UK, and we are pursuing increased bilateral trade."" But last month Trade minister Greg Hands told the Commons ""we do not have a bilateral trade agreement with China… and we have no plans for a bilateral trade agreement with China."" Last night the Inter-Parliamentary Group on China, an anti-Beijing bloc of MPs, said: ""The Government need to come back to parliament and explain the reasons for this change in position."" Their spokesman added: ""The public have a right to know exactly how big the trade deal with China will be and when the PM will be signing it."" Speaking to The Sun on Monday, Mr Johnson also said he had seen ""no conclusive evidence"" of the theory pushed by the US State Department that the Covid pandemic was sparked after an accident at lab in Wuhan. But he urged the Chinese government to be more open about the early days of the bug. He said: ""It is very important that China should share with the world all the data about how the disease may or may not have originated. ""If it was a zoonotic disease, if it originated in a you know... I don't know, a meeting between a bat or a pangolin, or whatever, we need to know."" Mr Johnson was asked about reports he had recently told a group of business leaders that he was a ""Sinophile"" - someone who loves China.

""The more I read about other stuff, the more convinced I am that that's what we should focus on."" The PM added: ""What the electorate in Scotland want is a government that focuses on their needs for education, fighting crime, governing sensibly with sensible policies on taxation and everything else. ""I don't see that from the Scottish National Party. I don't see that at all and I'd rather hold them to account for that.""

Then-Home Secretary Sajid Javid tore up her citizenship on national security grounds when she was discovered pregnant in a refugee camp in 2019.

Ministers challenged it in the highest court of the land, which presents its judgement today. Priti Patel said Begum coming back to the UK ""would create significant national security risks"" and expose the public to ""an increased risk of terrorism"". Government lawyer Sir James Eadie QC told the court the intelligence assessments gauged that Begum presented a serious threat ""justifying the removal of her British citizenship and … the placing of serious impediments in the way of her return to the UK"".

188,Real,The Sun,"RISHI Sunak's Budget next week will be an expensive and painful sandwich of giveaways and tax hikes. Insiders are calling it ""two big slices of bread with very thin jam"". Slice one is a £30billion Covid support bundle that will see furlough, business relief, the Universal Credit uplift and stamp duty holiday all extended to June. Doing this for three months more, to bring those measures in line with the Government's programme for coming out of lockdown, leaves ""thin jam"" — or little to spend elsewhere. Slice two is a painful package of tax hikes to start raising billions to close the UK's budget deficit, which will hit £400billion by April. Experts say that needs reducing by around £30-40billion now to stabilise borrowing and prevent debt from rising as a percentage of national income. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said: ""Even if the Government was comfortable with stabilising debt at 100 per cent of national income — its highest level since 1960 — it would still need a fiscal tightening worth 2.1 per cent of national income, or £43billion."" In a bid to prove to the world that Britain's spending is not out of control, Chancellor Mr Sunak will likely announce a hike in corporation taxes — up to as much as 25 per cent from 19 per cent over a number of years. Raising capital gains will target the rich, such as second-home owners. A government source said: ""Action needs to be taken now, not in November and not next year, but now. ""The Budget will make a start on that stabilisation. It can't go the whole way in one fiscal event but it will make a start."" Covid spending means ""thin jam"" for other giveaways. Mr Sunak is under pressure to keep the freeze on fuel duty rises and give a lockdown recovery gift of slashed booze levies plus allocating cash for infrastructure plans in the North. Labour has insisted: ""Now is not the time for tax rises for families or businesses."" WE couldn't believe our ears. Who was this politician yesterday, soundly agreeing with The Sun that ""now is not the time for tax rises for businesses""? None other than Sir Keir, the Starmer chameleon. A little more than a year ago,  this same man campaigned to install  mega-taxing, business-wrecking, Brexit- reversing Marxists in Downing Street. Yet here he was, for once making sense. Sadly, Chancellor Rishi Sunak seems focused on tax hikes to whittle down the vast Covid debt. We sympathise. But we're not minded to back any. We will shed the fewest tears about owners of multiple homes paying more capital gains tax when they flog them. But increasing corporation tax now, when Britain desperately needs firms to create jobs and growth, is madness. Does it not bother the Treasury to be plotting tax rises even Labour baulks at? Pleas not to hike fuel duty — backed by The Sun's Keep It Down crusade — come as a new eco-petrol is sanctioned for use at UK pumps.

190,Real,The Sun,"MORE than two dozen Tory MPs have written to Rishi Sunak urging him not to raise fuel tax in his Budget. They say Boris Johnson made a pledge in 2019 not to increase the hated levy and breaking the vow would betray voters. The 26 Conservatives - including former ministers Tracey Crouch, Esther McVey, David Davis and Iain Duncan Smith said Brits pay more at the pumps than anywhere in the EU. The 58p-a-litre levy is in the Chancellor's sights - with as much as a 5p rise being considered - to help plug the Covid black-hole next week. But the letter shows Downing Street faces a major rebellion on Mr Sunak's Budget if drivers are targeted. The warning shot was organised by Rob Halfon MP and Howard Cox, of Fair Fuel UK - who have been working with The Sun to ""Keep It Down"" for a decade. It says the move would ""create significant economic difficulties"" for millions. The letter says analysis by the Centre for Economics and Business Research shows ""a hike of 2p would cut GDP by £600million, reduce employment by 8,000 jobs and add 0.6% to inflation"". THE new unemployment figures should send a chill down Rishi Sunak's spine. His upcoming Budget could so easily make matters worse. The Chancellor is focused on jobs, and rightly so. But almost every day brings a new leak of a worrying Treasury plan to raise this tax or that. Our views on the madness of hammering working people with extra fuel duty are well known. But hiking corporation tax from the low levels which helped the Tories conjure a job-creation miracle in the last recession is similarly crazy. Unemployment is at a five-year high. Once the furlough ends, the dole queue is likely to lengthen dramatically. Mr Sunak must learn from history. In the decades after World War Two, the US and West Germany encouraged the free market with lower taxes and far less state intervention. Britain maintained high taxes and a big state controlling vast swathes of the economy. America prospered. West Germany rose from its ruins to become Europe's powerhouse. By the 1970s, Britain was Europe's basket case, begging a handout from the International Monetary Fund. In the post-Covid era we could raise taxes, maintain the State at pandemic emergency levels, as Labour would love, and entrench our decline for decades. Instead we must use low taxes to create jobs, investment and growth and capitalise on our new independence outside the EU. Last night, Mr Halfon said: ""If the Government needs funds, it should tax millionaires, rather than millions of hard-working Brits."" Howard Cox added: ""Truckers and van drivers are the solution to get back to sanity.

192,Real,The Sun,"BORIS Johnson will today unveil his March to Freedom — with loved ones able to meet outdoors and kids back in classrooms from next month. The national stay-at-home order is to be scrapped as the Rule of Six returns in late March, with sports back on as part of a four-step plan to ease lockdown. The Prime Minister will publish storming data that shows the vaccine rollout has led directly to tumbling deaths and hospital cases. His blueprint will see lockdown eased in four steps — with four key tests applied to each stage of the way to freedom. Mr Johnson will warn that for each step to be taken, benchmark numbers will need to be met on: He will reserve the right to slam the brakes on lifting lockdown if a new variant of the virus emerges. Regional tiers have been ditched and all of England will begin the phased return to normality. Today I'll be setting out a roadmap to bring us out of lockdown cautiously. Our priority has always been getting children back into school which we know is crucial for their education and wellbeing. We'll also be prioritising ways for people to reunite with loved ones safely. Step One will see kids return to classrooms on March 8 and ""ways for people to reunite with loved ones safely"" prioritised. Three weeks later, on March 29, the ""Rule of Six"" will return to parks and private gardens — allowing six people from up to six different households to mix outdoors. If just two households come together they can meet with no cap on their size. This means families will be meeting together in parks and gardens by Easter. Phase one of the plan was confirmed by Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi this morning. He said schools will reopen on March 8, at which point two people will also be allowed to meet up outdoors ""to address some of the issues around loneliness"". Then on March 29 two households of any size, or the rule of six, will also be able to gather outside. Mr Zahawi revealed families who live far apart will be able to travel across the country to meet outdoors from that date. And he outside confirmed sports, such as tennis and golf, will also return then. But those desperate for a haircut have to wait at least seven weeks for salons to reopen. It will be Mid-April before they are unlocked along with non-essential shops, while restaurants and pubs will be able to serve customers outdoors. The rest of restrictions will be eased in May and June with inside mixing and drinking — with the hope of normality by July, when every adult will have been offered a Covid jab first dose. Last night the PM said: ""Our decisions will be made on the latest data at every step. ""We will be cautious about this approach so that we do not undo the progress we have achieved so far and the sacrifices each and every one of you has made to keep yourself and others safe. ""We have therefore set four key tests which must be met before we can move through each step of the plan. I'll be setting out a roadmap to bring us out of lockdown cautiously."" He added: ""Our priority has always been getting children back into school, which we know is crucial for their education as well as their mental and physical well-being. ""And we will also be prioritising ways for people to reunite with loved ones safely."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there will be ""weeks between the steps"" — so ministers can ""watch carefully"" the impact of each relaxation of the restrictions. The first step on March 8 sees all kids back at school — with details of mass testing due in the roadmap. Two adults will also be allowed to socialise in a park from that date. Then to herald the start of the Easter holidays, outdoor sports like golf and tennis will also be allowed — alongside a return to organised sports such as football for children and adults alike. It is understood that hairdressers will finally be unlocked sometime between April 12 and 19. Last night Mr Johnson was under pressure to go even quicker than his proposed blueprint.

""There isn't strong evidence that teachers are more likely to catch Covid than any other group, but I'll leave it for the JCVI to set out what they think is the best order in which to do this that minimises the number of deaths."" But Mr Johnson's and Sir Keir's stance was backed by the Archbishop of Canterbury who said he was ""absolutely sure"" government was right to prioritise the reopening of schools.

A source said: ""As we wait for the vaccine rollout to reach everyone, it's essential that the rules are not ignored at the final stretch.

Mr Sunak slashed VAT for the pub and restaurant trade to five per cent to help it survive the pandemic - but that measure is due to end on March 31. There are fears that he will not extend the measure as he attempts to fill the financial black-hole sparked by Covid. But The Sun is calling for VAT to be kept low in next month's Budget as it has been such a lifeline. The Michelin starred chef, who employs around 600 people in the UK and thousands more around the world, told Mr Sunak that his interventions has been ""instrumental in maintaining some positivity"" across the hammered sector. The top Tory has started a series of ""In Conversation"" meetings with industry leaders – to hear directly how he can help them fight the pandemic and put rocket boosters under Britain's recovery. At their virtual meeting Mr Ramsay said: ""I think as a government, we've been supported better than any other country I know. ""And secondly, you've been precise, what you've said you've stood by and delivered."" ""I think we've been given one of the most incredible support systems from the furlough scheme, which was instrumental in maintaining some positivity. I think you delivered beyond. ""But the downside for me is that we have lost some really good restaurants that were good, but sadly, there are going to be casualties."" Mr Sunak boosted hopes he will do more to save the trade, by telling Mr Ramsay: ""Economically it's incredibly important, but also it's that connection with people in their communities. ""It just gives joy to people's lives. It brings life to villages, towns across the country, and seeing that taken from us is incredibly sad and we have to recapture that again.""

Sir Mike Penning MP, Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Road Freight and Logistics said: ""It will be impossible for our economy to recover without a road freight and logistics sector that is fighting fit. ""The Chancellor must ensure that the Budget supports and protects this vital industry which has been so badly hit by the impacts of the pandemic. ""For far too long our hauliers have been hit with the highest rate of fuel duty in Europe. ""The Chancellor can send a powerful statement about the value of the industry by ending this fuel duty penalty through the introduction of an essential user rebate bringing us in line with our European neighbours."" The Treasury declined to comment on Budget ""speculation.""",Real Sun,433.0
200,Real,The Sun,"WOKE wars have broken out in the Black Country after Facebook tried to censor online appreciation of traditional local dish faggots and peas. The Californian tech giants issued a grovelling apology after trying to ban a West Midlands local history group for discussing their love of the ancient meatball treat - sparking fury from locals and MPs. Members of a popular community group were left in disbelief after users were warned about posting ""offensive"" and ""homophobic"" content. But last night Facebook said sorry over the row, blaming faulty tech for tech for the blunder. A spokesperson said: ""Our systems clearly made a mistake here and we apologise to users whose posts about this local delicacy were affected. We're looking into what happened and are taking steps to rectify the error."" Faggots and peas is a traditional dish in the Black Country - but residents were told they were breaching community standards by discussing the local delicacy. Admin Linda Beech has now had to warn users of to stop using the the word 'faggot', which is sometimes used as a derogatory term for a gay person in the USA. In Britain, faggots are meatballs traditionally hand-made with offal by butchers and served with mashed potatoes and peas. Local MP Mike Wood has slammed the censorship, branding it ""ludicrous"". And the Dudley South Tory even invited Facebook's billionaire boss Mark Zuckerberg to come and sample the local delicacy ""next time you are in Brierley Hill"". In a letter to the tech guru, Mr Wood wrote: ""Online services like Facebook have an important – and challenging – role to play in combating abuse and extremism on their platforms, and I know the hurt that inappropriate language can cause. ""I don't pretend that there are any easy solutions that will keep everybody happy. ""However, perhaps I could suggest as a rough rule of thumb that hate speech rarely involves recipes for offal meatballs and peas."" He added: ""The supposed violations appear to relate to a number of posts relating to the traditional Black Country delicacy of faggots and peas (or ""faggits and paes"" as they are sometimes known in these parts), large pork meatballs that have been eaten locally since at least the middle of the nineteenth century. ""One of the group's admins has already been thrown out, and the group has been told that more admin violations may result in the group being disabled. ""It's ludicrous that you're banning a group celebrating a local recipe. What next? Censorship of spotted dick and a lifetime ban for Bake Off? And he insisted: ""There is nothing homophobic, discriminatory or hateful about faggots and peas."" Dudley North MP, Marco Longhi added ""this woke agenda has gone too far. First it was historic statues and now it's our food. What will they target next?"" The fellow Tory went on: ""I'm very tempted to send Mr Zuckerberg some lovely homemade faggots and peas!"" And web users have blasted the social media giant for ""political correctness gone mad"" after they were threatened with a permanent ban for talking about their famous dish. Linda, who runs Pensnett, Brierley Hill and Blackcountry Now and Then page, which has nearly 14,000 members, told followers: ""We are in danger of losing the group."" She wrote: ""Please be careful and think before you comment on the subject, as a few of you are still putting us at risk."" She also revealed how one admin member had already been kicked off the website after Facebook trawled through posts dating back to May last year. She said: ""Facebook searched back to May last year and showed me the content, of which was perfectly acceptable to us Blackcountry Folks. ""One more strike and the group would have been evaporated. ""I know he is very upset and wounded with me, but I had no power of my own to prevent this happening to him. ""I feel as though I have lost my right arm, I cannot thank my other Admins enough for their total loyalty to the group."" Linda has built the group up over five years and it has become a space to share old photographs and to reminisce about Black Country's heritage. Community campaigner Adam Davies says he has written to Facebook to call for intervention to help save the group. He said: ""I have written a fairly lengthy report to Facebook as well as an email to their press team outlining the full context of the issue which their system is incorrectly flagging up. ""Obviously I won't post the text of my email here because it contains the word which is in question, but it simply can't be right that the existence of this brilliant group and the heritage of our area should be under threat because a Facebook algorithm/system doesn't understand the name of a food dish which has long been associated with our area.

Drivers outside the South East spend a third more of their incomes on fuel, campaigners say. And if the Chancellor raises the hated 57.95p a litre tax on fuel, it will hit new Tory voters in the former Red Wall areas the hardest, their data shows. Campaigning Tory MP Robert Halfon said: ""Coronavirus has hurt the low-paid and increased the cost of living. ""A fuel duty increase would be a hammer blow to workers and our public services."" Analysis by CEBR for FairFuelUK reveals motorists in London and the Home Counties spend between 2.2 per cent and 3.5 per cent of their household income filling up. But that figure is 4.5 per cent in the North East — and even more in Wales and Northern Ireland. WE'RE mobilising supporters to email their MPs and the Treasury to end the idea of raising fuel duty. There is only so much motorists can take. With diesel and petrol vehicles to be axed in just nine years, keeping fuel duty frozen is the least they can do. Better still, cut it and watch UK plc and government approval flourish. A decade ago, The Sun launched the Keep It Down fuel duty campaign.

202,Real,The Sun,"TECH giants that have boomed in the pandemic must now give back with a tax on their revenues. That is the message Rishi Sunak will deliver to fellow finance chiefs as Britain starts its presidency of the G7. The Chancellor will meet counterparts from the world's powerhouses this afternoon — and the ""Amazon and Facebook Tax"" will be top of his agenda. Britain will host the annual gathering of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the United States. The world leaders will meet in Cornwall in June — but the finance ministers are the first to get together via Zoom. Mr Sunak has tried to tax tech firms two per cent of their UK revenues. But the global firms use sophisticated structures, moving money and assets around as well as basing themselves offshore so it is hard to establish true revenues. Mr Sunak wants to use this year to set up a global effort to target these profits, coordinated by the G7 group. Global attempts to clamp down on US tech giants faltered after fierce resistance from Donald Trump when he was president. But Mr Sunak's allies say there is growing hope of ""more scope"" with the new Joe Biden administration in the White House.

203,Real,The Sun,"BORIS Johnson and his top ministers were aware ""more than a year ago"" that the American woman charged over the death of Harry Dunn was a spy, senior sources have told The Sun. A US court heard last week that fugitive mother-of-three Anne Sacoolas worked in intelligence, but Downing Street have repeatedly insisted Washington only told them she was a diplomat's wife. But The Sun has learnt the UK Government had established Sacoolas's espionage background in the weeks after she fled Britain following her fatal crash with the teenage biker in August 2019. Yet they did not tell Harry's family, despite them asking Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab directly if she was a spy. The Prime Minister has never spoken to Harry's grieving parents, even after repeated requests for a meeting or a call. Sacoolas fled the UK in mid-September 2019 claiming diplomatic immunity, with her lawyer finally admitting last week she was ""employed by an intelligence agency in the US"" at the time which was ""especially a factor"" in her departure. Although Dominic Raab insists he was not aware of the case until after Sacoolas was back in the US, this newspaper has established security officials, diplomats and ministers did learn of her spy past in the autumn of 2019. And multiple sources have told The Sun the PM was personally made aware of the situation. No10 have declined to say whether Mr Johnson thinks the United States ""misled"" Britain about Sacoolas's intelligence career - in what would be a major blow to the Special Relationship But the slain teen's parents have vowed to get to the truth. Last night the family said the case was getting ""murkier and murkier"" as they once again urged the PM and Mr Raab to ""come clean"" on exactly what they knew and when. Family spokesman Radd Seiger told The Sun: ""Harry's parents have only ever wanted the truth and justice for their son. ""To learn, after all this time, that the PM was aware of Mrs Sacoolas' status shortly after the crash and yet did not ensure that the parents were told, is deeply hurtful."" He added: ""We met with Dominic Raab on 18 December 2019 and 28 January 2020 and several times since and he did not tell us the truth despite us asking the direct question as to whether she was a spy when Harry died. ""We need to know who knew what and when, and why we were not told."" Asked about the case this week, the PM's press secretary Allegra Stratton said: ""I am afraid I can't comment in total detail on that but our position on that has been quite consistent... we couldn't have lawfully prevented her from leaving the UK."" ""But the Americans refusal to extradite [Sacoolas] is a denial of justice and that is something that the Foreign Secretary has raised with his opposite number in America."" Asked why the PM has not met Harry's family, she replied: ""I think the family has had considerable engagement with our politicians and I think that it's proper for the people who are familiar with details of the case to deal with the family."" Ms Stratton added: ""The Prime Minister understands the gravity of how they feel and can only sympathise with the distress of his death in the first place and then how it's how it has been drawn out in the months and years since.""",Real Sun,568.0

205,Real,The Sun,"ALL over 50s - and half of the UK population - will have been jabbed by the end of April, ministers boasted today. Thirty-two million jabs for the over 50s and the vulnerable had been promised by the ""Spring"" - but the Cabinet Office confirmed today that means ""by May"". The admission came as they confirmed local elections would take place that month despite some Covid restrictions likely to be in place. They said: ""The UK's vaccination programme is planned to have reached all nine priority cohorts by May, meaning that the Government can commit to go ahead with these polls with confidence."" JCVI priority groups 1-9 are estimated to cover around 27 million people in England and 32 million people across the UK. Yesterday, Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said Britain will be able to massively ease restrictions once all over-50s have been offered the jab ""by late spring"". But Downing Street had repeatedly refused to say when they believed Spring to end and Summer start. And the end of April target is even more ambitious than lockdown sceptical Tory backbenchers had hoped. Mark Harper — chairman of the Covid Recovery Group of lockdown sceptics, with 70 Tory MPs — said: ""Back-of-the-envelope calculations I did based on two million doses a week mean you could get the top nine priority groups, first doses, and the top four groups, second doses, all done by the end of May."" He added: ""So it seems to me by the time you get to the end of May, no later than that, you should be in a position to get rid of restrictions completely. ""But obviously it does depend on the rollout of the vaccine."" It comes after NHS chief Sir Simon Stevens said the same thing earlier this month. Speaking to MPs on the public accounts committee, he said: ""This is a sprint to mid-February [to vaccinate the four highest priority groups] and then it will be a sprint from mid-February through to the end of April to extend the vaccination to the rest of the higher risk groups identified by the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation. ""Then it will be a marathon from April into the autumn . . . where we are offering everybody in the country who wants it, over the age of 18 for whom the vaccines are authorised, that jab."" Another member told The Sun the group backed Mr Harper's call for restrictions to be totally torn up in May if over-50s have been immunised by then. The UK vaccinated another 469,016 people on Wednesday, meaning nearly 10.5 million Brits have now received their first dose of the jab. Deaths have also dropped by a quarter with 915 recorded yesterday and 20,634 daily infections. And Mr Zahawi was ""confident"" the country will hit its target of offering a jab to all 15 million of the most vulnerable by mid-February. The vaccines chief said that once all over-50s are vaccinated, Britain will be able to tear up many of the draconian restrictions which have turned lives upside down. He said: ""We want to reopen schools, reopen our economy, get our lives back, but never have to go back into another severe lockdown like the one we're all experiencing and suffering from at the moment. ""You've got to make sure that your vaccination programme has protected the top nine categories in phase one — that is 99 per cent of mortality."" The Government has vowed to do this by ""late spring"". No10 has vowed to offer all adults a vaccine by September. But there are early signs that the turbocharged vaccination programme is going so well the UK could beat its targets. There is also hope that with 60 per cent of the country vaccinated, Britain could effectively achieve herd immunity by July. Experts from University College London say the R rate is already down to 0.75 — the lowest it has been since the first lockdown. Research by Prof Karl Friston suggests a combination of Covid jabs, natural immunity and better weather will bring an end to the pandemic in the UK. Prof Friston said that was a ""realistic"" forecast of the nation's progress against the bug. He told The Sun: ""It is not concerned with the worst case scenarios — but the most likely case."" And Prof Andrew Hayward, of the Sage government advisory body, said: ""We will be more or less back to normal for the summer.""",Real Sun,741.0
206,Real,The Sun,"BORIS Johnson and Dominic Raab must ""come absolutely clean"" about when they learnt the killer of Harry Dunn was a secret US spy, the dead teenager's family have demanded. Lawyers representing American mum-of-three Anne Sacoolas sensationally admitted in a US Court that she was a intelligence agent. Sacoolas fled Britain after a fatal smash with the 19 year old motorcyclist outside RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire in August 2019. She was driving on the wrong side of the road but claimed diplomatic immunity as her husband worked at the US spy base. But on Wednesday night,  the Alexandria district court in Virginia was told Anne Sacoolas was ""employed by an intelligence agency in the US"" at the time of the fatal  collision - which was ""especially a factor"" in her flight from the UK. Her lawyer said she fled the country due to ""issues of security"". The Sun understands she had a ""high flying career"" in the CIA. The bombshell revelations came out during Sacoolas's bid to dismiss a civil claim for damages against her made by the late Harry's family. The suspect's lawyer, John McGavin, told the court he could not ""completely candidly"" explain why the Sacoolas family left the UK - adding: ""I know the answer, but I cannot disclose it."" Sacoolas's career in espionage was first revealed by the Press last year, but the US or UK government have never commented - and Sacoolas herself had remained tight lipped until now. Harry's grieving family have been kept in the dark for more than a year by the Foreign Office despite many pleas for information. Last night the family said Harry's father asked the Foreign Secretary ""point blank in a meeting"" at the FCO in January 2020 whether or not Mrs Sacoolas was working at the time of the crash. But Mr Raab's response was that ""she used to work for the State Department."" The family's spokesman Radd Seiger told The Sun: ""We now call on Mr Raab to come absolutely clean to the parents and the British public about what he knew about Mrs Sacoolas' employment status, when he became aware of it."" ""And what are the British Government is now going to do following this astonishing revelation to help the parents once and for all to get Justice for Harry?""

But a spokesman insisted ""she was notified to the UK Government by the US as a spouse with no official role"".

207,Real,The Sun,"CHINA's state-owned broadcaster has been zapped from British screens amid a row over the influence of the increasingly isolated Communist regime in Beijing. TV regulator Ofcom revoked China Global Television Network's right to broadcast after a year-long probe into political influence on the station. The move follows a £200,000 fine for Kremlin-backed Russia Today for biased broadcasting in 2019. And it comes amid growing tension between the UK and the super state over Hong Kong, genocide claims and truth behind the Covid-19 outbreak. Ofcom ruled that the English-language news channel's owners Star China Media Limited were not in control of its editorial output, and rejected an attempt to change owners amid the row. The quango said on Thursday that the company was ""ultimately controlled by the Chinese Communist Party."" ""The days of Beijing's genocide-denying, democracy-trampling propaganda are over."" They insisted that they had given the channel ""significant time to come into compliance with the statutory rules"" but ""those efforts have now been exhausted."" In a statement they said: ""Following careful consideration, taking account of all the facts and the broadcaster's and audience's rights to freedom of expression, we have decided it is appropriate to revoke the licence for CGTN to broadcast in the UK."" In 2020, Ofcom found CGTN had breached the broadcasting code by failing to preserve due impartiality in its coverage of the Hong Kong protests. Tonight the move was welcomed by anti-China voices as a victory against ""propaganda."" Conservative MP Bob Seeley of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China said it was ""the right move."" He added: ""It cannot be correct that an arm of a regime that doesn't recognise rights to freedom of speech at home is allowed to break UK laws in order to peddle its propaganda on the airwaves.""

Police are probing possible Covid rule breaches at the gathering in Londonderry on Monday. But the BBC's description of the late McCourt as a ""veteran"" - giving equivalence between criminals and troops - sparked uproar. Defence chiefs, MPs and former soldiers raged against the corporation, accusing it of besmirching the 1,400 British soldiers who laid down their lives during The Troubles. Former Defence Minister Lord Lancaster told The Sun the BBC's choice of words was ""bizarre and deeply insulting"". ""It's an accolade to be called a veteran. A tribute to serving your country. It should never be used to champion terrorism."" He blasted giving ""equivalence to terrorists"" and ""thousands of military veterans who have sacrificed so much to deliver security for our nation.""

And PM Boris Johnson has stepped into a growing Cabinet rift to demand a middle way to avoid a cliff-edge. It has been seen as a weekly lifeline to Britain's poorest families, adding an extra £1,040 a year income. Chancellor Rishi Sunak does not want to make the £6billion uplift permanent but is under pressure from MPs and Work and Pensions Secretary Thérèse Coffey to change his mind. He says it will cost the equivalent of a penny on income tax for 30 million Brits, and a 5p rise in fuel duty to fill the black hole in Britain's battered finances. A Government source said: ""It's not a binary choice between extending or not. All options remain on the table and ministers are working through them to find the best solution for families and those on lower incomes."" It is understood Mr Sunak plans to announce at the Budget that the full measure will stay for a long as Covid restrictions are in place, before being phased out to help only the neediest. He has considered easing the withdrawal pain with a one-off cash bonus of £500 but his allies reject reports it could rise to £1,000. One Tory MP said: ""Why favour welfare claimants rather than soldiers, doctors, police, nurses and teachers? If anyone deserves a pandemic bonus, it is them.""

Robert Halfon said the PM must use the full ""engine of Government""  to ""get our schools open again after February half term"" - beginning in areas with lower Covid cases instead of  waiting for a national reopening. The prominent Tory MP's intervention came after Health Secretary Matt Hancock hinted teachers WILL be jabbed as a priority - but that won't happen before Easter. There are fears some children in areas with high Covid rates won't be able to return to class until May as the government looks set to rule out any kids returning before February half-term this week. Raising concerns that kids won't be back before April, Mr Hancock refused to put a date on schools returning today. Despite saying there were ""early signs"" cases are falling, the health secretary said it was ""far far far too soon"" to be able to talk about lifting lockdown. But his comments sparked anger from Mr Halfon who is the Chairman of Parliament's powerful Education Select Committee. He wants schools in lower case areas to be allowed to reopen sooner rather than waiting for a blanket reopening across England. The Essex MP told The Sun today: ""Long after the coronavirus has gone our younger children could be mired in ditch of educational poverty, a mental health crises and safeguarding hazards because of the damage of school closures."" And he demands: ""The engine of Government should be directed to do everything possible to get our schools open again after February half term - as was stated previously by the Prime Minister. ""If there are areas of the country with low Covid rates, there should be no reason not to open the schools."" He added: ""As the Deputy Chief Medical Officer said to our Education committee recently, teachers and support staff are at no greater risk than any other profession, nor is there evidence that schools are significant transmitters of the virus."" The row comes as Mr Hancock rejected an offer from an independent headteachers group to jab half a million teachers over next month's half term. On Sunday morning Mr Hancock said teachers have a ""good shout"" of being high on the coronavirus vaccine priority list once the most clinically vulnerable have received their jabs. But health sources say this is unlikely to begin before April and the list of next wave tobe jabbed is still being decided. Bosses of Britain's leading private schools and academies have offered to vaccinate all of the UK's teachers at half term at no cost to the government. But Mr Hancock hit back: ""It's not a matter of logistics, the logistics can be organised. ""The challenge is the supply of vaccine, supply is the rate-limiting factor. ""The question is who should have each dose as it comes in... and we've taken the decision, quite rightly, to go through in order of clinical need, starting with those who are most likely to die from this disease.

The Governor of the British Virgin Islands has sent for a judge from London to investigate allegations of systematic criminality of the tiny West Indies paradise The islands were devastated by Hurricane Irma in 2017 and there have been long standing suspicions that British taxpayer funded help has gone into the pockets of local public officials and their associates. The UK gave more than £50 million in support to the  BVI and neighbouring Anguilla in the wake of the hurricane. And those same fears have been raised over an extra £30 million of local cash earmarked to help fight Covid. Whitehall insiders say there have been ""very serious and troubling allegations of corruption, intimidation and other criminal activity.""

Sir Gary Hickinbottom will have powers to summon any islander and demand its government hand over crucial documentation. Ministers have been under mounting pressure to tackle corruption in the troubled region that is central to the South American drug trafficking trade into the United States. Last December nearly two and a half tonnes of cocaine were seized from a serving cop's house in the BVI. The £189million stash is the equivalent to three quarters of the entire national budget of the territory. But sources say that haul may be ""just tip of the iceberg"" when it comes to corruption in the the BVI. It is understood the allegations include misuse of over £85 million of support for infrastructure and transport - including some £5million spent on BVI Airways which does not exist, and nearly a £1m spent building a school wall. £25 million spent on a cruise ship dock and £45 million on hospital have also raised suspicions. There are also concerns that Covid contracts have been given to public officials' own companies, and even spent on luxury rentals. Attempts to silence the media and critics will also be investigated by the judge. Despite running on a transparency platform in 2019, the Island's current Premier Andrew Fahie has yet to improve governance and delayed promised reforms for ministers and the criminal justice system. Instead hurricane relief funds have been brought under the direct control of ministers, deepening suspicions.

229,Real,The Sun,"LIFE-and-death decisions over Covid would have troubled wise old King Solomon, Boris Johnson has claimed. No10 officials are considering the prospect of a further lockdown next month as millions wake today under tough Tier 4 restrictions. In a letter seen by The Sun thanking Whitehall chiefs for their service this year, Mr Johnson said only a ""colossal effort"" had averted a potential disaster. He said fighting the virus has meant ""some of the toughest decisions — indeed Solomonic judgments — that any of us have ever had to take."" Solomon, the Old Testament King of Israel, was renowned for his God-given wisdom. It follows a series of tough decisions by the PM, the latest sparked by a jump in cases caused by the new mutant Covid. He had wanted a five-day relaxation of social restrictions so people could meet indoors at Christmas but was forced into the ""very tough"" call to axe it to one day amid fears get-togethers would see infections rocket further. Millions had to spend Christmas Day alone. Residents already in Tier 4 areas — such as the South East and London — could not lawfully meet others outside their household or support bubbles. Six million more were added to Tier 4 at 00.01am today meaning 24million people, or 43 per cent of England's population, are in lockdown in all but name. Mr Johnson said on Thursday that tougher restrictions may be needed to prevent the mutant strain ""running out of control"". He refused to rule out using January for a third national lockdown, saying it would be a ""tough period."" He added: ""As much as I regret that, I do think it is necessary for us to drive down this virus now to stop it running out of control. ""We need to buy ourselves time to get the vaccine into as many arms of the elderly and vulnerable as we can.""",Real Sun,315.0

Work and Pensions Secretary Thérèse Coffey is pushing for a massive expansion in Whitehall departments employing recent prison leavers. She wants two ex-cons in every government section in a bid to set an example to the private sector. And she urged PM Boris Johnson to lead from the front. Ms Coffey has demanded 10 Downing Street go further by taking on a pair of former prisoners who were convicted of sex crimes, saying it would be seen as an ""action of substance"". Her plans have been met with short shrift by No10 insiders who have so far tried to block the move. One branded it ""a bad idea from TV political farce The Thick Of It"".

Speaking to the Commons Justice Committee she said: ""I think we need to employ, in the Ministry of Justice in any event, ex-offenders more. ""I have asked the department to look at all our contracts to see how we can employ more ex-offenders through the private providers who we contract with."" The Government has drawn up a target of 150 ex-offenders to work in probation services, something Ms Frazer said was a great start.

231,Real,The Sun,"BORIS Johnson secured his landmark Christmas Eve Brexit deal hours after telling Brussels: ""I won't sign it — I won't"" in a massive row about taxes. The livid PM warned the EU its demands to slap trade tariffs on Britain if we did not let them fish our waters forever was a deal breaker. A source told The Sun: ""The PM was ready to walk at that point. ""We were writing a script trying to explain to the world we had blown up a £660billion deal over less than a billion quid of fish."" Mr Johnson's hardline stance saw Brussels blink on the demand late on Tuesday, with the EU asking for a long transition for their fishing boats ""as cover"" for their climbdown. An insider said: ""It meant we could take back control of our waters as we promised at the 2016 referendum. The PM stared them down and it worked."" Mr Johnson says his deal is ""glad tidings of great joy"" for Britain as we will be unshackled from 40 years of Brussels control. Brandishing a copy of the 1,260-page zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement signed with Brussels at 2.44pm on Thursday, the PM quipped: ""I have a small present for anyone who may be looking for something to read in that sleepy post-Christmas lunch moment."" In all, 200 officials — including EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier — spent more than 2,000 hours haggling over details on everything from electric car batteries to mackerel. But during one of the tensest moments of the talks, Mr Johnson's phone line with Brussels seemed to have gone dead. Discussing the initial time EU boats will be allowed to carry on fishing UK waters, the European Commission's president Ursula von der Leyen said: ""Six years."" The PM hit back: ""Five"" — then heard nothing. There was almost three minutes of silence before the No10 switchboard operator told him: ""I'm sorry PM, we seem to have lost the European Commission."" But a distant German voice said: ""No, no, I'm still here. 5½ years?"" Insiders say that was the moment that unlocked the talks and let Mr Johnson — wearing his fish tie — declare that Brexit Britain will be back in ""control of our destiny"" and our waters on January 1. Brussels diplomats met yesterday morning to rubber-stamp the deal that will go to MPs on Wednesday. But ministers were suspicious last night they still had not been shown the full text of the accord. THE full text is yet to be released but both sides have lifted the lid on the contents of the historic accord — which runs to 1,260 pages. Planes, trains and roads will largely be unaffected by the agreement but there will be noticeable differences elsewhere from next year: IMMIGRATION: EU citizens will no longer have the automatic right to move to the UK. Instead they must apply under our new points-based system like the rest of the world. UK travellers will need a visa if they intend to spend more than 90 days a year in the EU. GOODS: THE first zero-tariff, zero-quota deal signed by the EU with a third country will allow unlimited goods to continue flowing freely from Britain to the Continent and back. There are protections for Stilton and Champagne plus approval to carry on shipping animal products. TRADE: The UK will finally be free to strike deals with countries like the United States. The deal will also give some protection to our gigantic financial services industry. LEVEL PLAYING FIELD: A sticking point was whether Brexit Britain could undercut the EU by being more competitive. But it seems the PM saw off attempts to bind the UK to EU rules forever or face its tariffs. Both sides will be able to retaliate if one of their sectors is being hampered by the other. But the devil will be in the detail of how, and what the new joint body to oversee this will look like. EU judges will have no overseer role involving UK law. FISH: EU boats are allowed to carry on fishing UK waters at current rates for another 5½ years. After that there will be a 25 per cent reduction in EU quotas, meaning the UK will fish two thirds of British waters by 2026. The PM promised to spend £100million getting coastal communities ready for big hauls. SECURITY: The UK will no longer be part of the European Arrest Warrant and is locked out of live access to EU databases. But Brits say cross-border cooperation will continue. One told The Sun: ""It feels like it's hiding a very big 'but'."" The accord is due to be published in full this morning. Mr Johnson hopes the compromise on fishing, which means another half-decade before we get control of our waters, will not halt MP approval. He said in a Christmas message: ""This is the feast, full of fish by the way."" Fishing industry figures have already accused Mr Johnson of ""sacrificing"" them. But the PM said the deal brings ""certainty to business, travellers and all the investors in our country — and a happy, successful and stable partnership with our friends in the EU for years to come.""",Real Sun,866.0

The Transport Secretary says work on emergency plans in the light of trade talks collapsing had been ""brought forward by a few weeks"". And heaping pressure on Brussels to climb down in negotiations, Mr Shapps added this had helped avoid significant chaos with the French travel ban. He claimed 500 backed-up lorries in Dover, Kent, had been whittled down to 170 in 24 hours, with measures to control overflow working smoothly — though industry officials disputed this. Mr Shapps said: ""Some of the reason we are not seeing big problems in Kent is because work going on for very many months, years even, is coming to fruition — a little earlier than anticipated. ""To a large extent, it shows we are ready."" Yet last night, hopes of a trade deal soared amid claims the EU had reduced demands for a fishing transition period from ten years to five. Work going on for very many months is coming to fruition. To a large extent, it shows we are ready. It is understood Brussels could settle on around a 35 per cent reduction in quotas — a £140million per year boost to UK fishing. Earlier, Boris Johnson had shot down demands to extend the transition period past the end of the year. He was backed by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who claimed: ""I don't want an extension, I want a deal."" SNP chief Nicola Sturgeon, London Mayor Sadiq Khan and some Tory MPs said Brexit should be delayed due to Covid. They want the UK kept in the EU's single market and customs union until the end of March. But the idea was dismissed by officials, who said a delay would be pointless if legally possible.

NHS England said they were aware of the strain only in mid-October with its significant transmission hike confirmed last week. Tory chair Amanda Milling said: ""It's irresponsible of Sir Keir to make claims when he doesn't possess the facts — a global pandemic is no time to be peddling falsehoods. ""If Captain Hindsight is so sure, let the country know where he got his facts from for this sheer attempt at political opportunism? ""When confronted with the facts that the new strain of the virus was transmitting faster we took the tough but necessary action to control the virus, protect the NHS and save lives."" Sir Keir used a press conference on Sunday morning to demand the PM apologise for cancelling Christmas - despite last week calling for tougher measures himself. The Labour leader hit out: ""This is not just one mistake when he has otherwise got things right. It is the same mistake over and over again. ""At the heart of the problem here is a Prime Minister who simply doesn't want to be unpopular and therefore won't take the tough decisions that are necessary, until he is forced into them at the 11th hour. But it was his claim that Mr Johnson ignored warnings about the mutant strain of Covid since September that enraged ministers.

The unit - dubbed the V Team - has been set up by Whitehall officials amid fears the UK's world beating vaccine deployment leaves the country open to attack.

A job advert circulated amongst former special forces and intelligence personnel says ""this is an issue of national importance so please dig deep and put your hand up if you are able to take this on.""

The PM today revealed the ""frighteningly transmissable"" new variant was spreading rapidly - forcing him to put millions of Brits in Tier 4 lockdown for Christmas. Boris today said that the new strain meant that the R rate could be increased by 0.4 as he revealed the festive season was cancelled. Speaking at a press conference today, the PM said the strain was ""spreading very fast"". He said: ""There's still much we don't know but it is spreading more quickly. ""There is no evidence however to suggest that it's more lethal or causes more severe illness. ""Equally, there is no evidence to suggest the vaccine will be any less effective."" Click the links below to find out more... Professor Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, today said the UK has informed the World Health Organisation that the new variant coronavirus can spread more rapidly. He said: ""There is no current evidence to suggest the new strain causes a higher mortality rate or that it affects vaccines and treatments, although urgent work is under way to confirm this. ""Given this latest development, it is now more vital than ever that the public continue to take action in their area to reduce transmission."" A Health source said: ""The last 48 hours have changed everything."" It is also feared to have first emerged in London and the South East as early as September, Chief Scientific Officer Sir Patrick Vallance said at today's Downing Street briefing. The strain - called VUI202012/01 - has caused cases to double in a week in the capital as it buckles under the new variant. The weekly average case rate is also up 66 per cent in two weeks for the rest of the country as the mutant strain tears through Covid hotspots. Data from the ONS shows that the new variant accounted for 62 per cent of all cases in London on the week commencing December 9, double the 28 per cent reported on the week commencing November 18. Professor Sir Mark Walport - a member of the Government's Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) - said there was a real possibility that the new variant could have a ""transmission advantage"". He told BBC2's Newsnight: ""What happens with viruses is they do naturally mutate all the time and the ones that are likely to do well are the ones that increase transmission."" ""We know that this is a new variant, it has been seen in other countries but it seems to be quite widespread which suggests that it has got a transmission advantage. ""Scientists are working extremely hard to work out what is going on. But it does definitely seem possible that this transmits more easily. ""It will make the social-distancing even more critical."" The Sun understands new evidence shows a dramatic hike in positive cases in London over the last week. The new strain is being blamed for a sudden uptick in hospitalisations in the Capital. And there are fears that people are catching it despite wearing PPE and socially distancing, pointing again to a surge in the virus's ability to spread. Large swathes of the South East were put in Tier 3 this week after the Government's review. Scientists have found this new strain of Covid-19 spreads faster than the original strain of the virus. The new variant that has been found predominantly in Kent and neighbouring areas - but has spread as far as Scotland. The Prime Minister could announce new travel restrictions on London and Kent on Saturday after a chilling warning from medics that is poised to ruin Christmas for millions. Such action would risk ruining Christmas for millions plunged into deeper lockdown rather than allowed to meet up under the festive bubbles plan. While it is too late to change the law, Mr Johnson was on Friday night consulting with Cabinet colleagues over whether to change festive advice for begging people not to leave the Capital next week. And the commuter belt of the South East has been blighted by soaring virus numbers meaning Christmas is on the cusp of being cancelled across the Home Counties.

244,Real,The Sun,"SIR Keir Starmer will order Labour MPs to back a Brexit deal to try to win back the North, his allies claim. Shadow Cabinet sources say the party will support ""almost any trade deal"" that PM Boris Johnson forges with Brussels. They hope that doing so will ""put the issue to bed for good"" and win back the trust of ""Red Wall"" voters lost to the Tories in last year's election. Strategists also say Labour's support will give the PM wiggle room to compromise and still have the votes to get an agreement through the Commons even with objections from those in his own party. Trade talks between the EU and UK are reaching an endgame, with negotiators ""working around the clock to get a deal"", according to Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove. Approval for any deal will be needed by the end of December for it to kick in on January 1, when Britain finally severs ties with the EU. Officially Labour said tonight that ""no decision has been taken about whipping or on votes"". But Sir Keir ally Rachel Reeves is said to have told Labour MPs that he is leaning towards backing the plan.",Real Sun,197.0
245,Real,The Sun,"ELDERLY relatives will be able to leave care homes to join their family for Christmas as long as everyone has had a test, The Sun has learnt. In a major boost for the UK's half million care home residents, Boris Johnson's ""festive bubbles"" to be unveiled this week will include provisions for grandparents to leave residential care and join a family household. Plans have been drawn up for a single care home resident to be allowed to join a single household over Christmas if everyone in that household has tested negative for Covid-19. Many elderly residents have been isolated from their families for months after care homes were hit hard by the virus. Those that are able to, and choose to visit their families or friends, will have to be tested or isolate when they return from that bubble to their care home after their festive break. Matt Hancock has already vowed to ring-fence rapid Covid swabs so families can visit their relatives in care homes if they want to. A pilot in 20 homes which started last week will end the need for pods and 'prison-style' plastic screens. Key visitors will be tested weekly at locations across Hampshire, Cornwall and Devon. It means they will finally be able to hug and hold hands with their relatives if they test negative beforehand. But the new rules will mean they can come to stay in the homes of their families if they want to as well. The welcome news for the elderly is part of the Christmas deal hammered out between Westminster and the Devolved Administrations in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales at the weekend. It comes after several high profile cases of people being arrested for trying to take their relatives out of their care homes. Ylenia Angeli, 73, had not been able to see mum Tina Thornborough for nine months before she ""sprung"" her from the home in Market Weighton, Yorkshire. ex-Coronation Street actress daughter filmed the moment Ylenia was arrested at a garden centre after wheeling her mum, who has dementia, from the care home before lockdown. Leandra Ashton, 41, who played Saskia Larson on the ITV soap in 2016, filmed the harrowing ordeal as her gran sat helplessly in the family car. Humberside Police said they responded to reports of an assault and Ylenia was subsequently ""de-arrested"". The united ""four nations"" approach for Christmas was agreed with principle by Michael Gove and regional counterparts on Saturday, with the PM expected to outline the full details later in the week. But The Sun revealed last week rules will be relaxed for five days from Christmas Eve until the delayed Boxing Day Bank Holiday on 28 December. Yesterday Mr Gove announced there would be ""limited additional household bubbling for a small number days"" with a cap of three households coming together expected. Households will be able to come together for a turkey dinner indoors amid fears Brits would simply ignore the rules. The ban on household mixing in Tier 2 and 3 of Covid restrictions is to be lifted and the rule of six is set to be suspended in Tier 1 to allow bigger groups to celebrate festive season. The Cabinet Office said there had been ""good progress made by all administrations over the past few days to design a single set of arrangements that can apply across the UK."" ""Ministers reiterated the importance of allowing families and friends to meet in a careful and limited way, while recognising that this will not be a normal festive period and the risks of transmission remain very real.""",Real Sun,595.0
246,Real,The Sun,"RISHI Sunak has vowed there will be ""no return to austerity"" to pay for Covid — but gave notice of massive tax hikes. The Chancellor, who presents his one-year Spending Review on Wednesday, warned that tough times are coming. He even joked he would have to ""take away the credit card"" from big-spending PM Boris Johnson. But Mr Sunak insisted now is not the time to impose tax rises ""in the fog of enormous economic uncertainty"". Yet he signalled he would have to begin to balance the books next year and the pain must be shared, meaning tax increases would happen. Mr Sunak will attempt to sugarcoat the pain with £152million earmarked for post-Covid parties in 2022. The cash will go towards the Festival UK — a showcase of all the great things about the country, nicknamed the Festival of Brexit — as well as the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations. He said: ""It has been an incredibly difficult year so I'm delighted the country has a number of exciting events to look forward to."" But a major row has erupted over Mr Sunak's plans to freeze public sector pay. TUC boss Frances O'Grady said nothing could be ruled out when asked if she would advocate strike action. Mr Sunak called it entirely reasonable to consider a pay freeze in an economy ravaged by coronavirus, though it is said to exempt NHS nurses and doctors. Labour claimed a freeze — including firefighters, hospital porters and teaching assistants — will ""make them worried about making ends meet ahead of Christmas"". But Mr Sunak said: ""What you will see is an increase in Government spending on day-to-day public services."" CHANCELLOR Rishi Sunak has had a ""good pandemic"" so far. The furlough scheme is working well (after a few initial hiccups). And his generous package for the hospitality sector stopped thousands of pubs and restaurants being driven into the ground. But giving away money was the easy bit. And Mr Sunak must think very carefully indeed about the measures he takes now to plug the gaping, Covid-shaped hole in public finances. A freeze to public sector pay we can countenance. In fact, it would hardly seem fair if private sector workers — who have been through the mill this year — were taxed to high heaven in order to give state workers with secure jobs a pay rise. Hiking corporation tax, on the other hand, would be an epic mistake. Even a small rise would cripple small firms desperately trying to get back on their feet after lockdown. And deterring entrepreneurs and chief executives from creating companies would be madness when unemployment is at a four-year high already — and set to spiral in the months ahead. We're not surprised that Mr Sunak wants to refill the country's coffers: it's downright alarming that Britain is £2 TRILLION in debt.

Shoppers should also be able to buy gifts and goodies in the high street next month. But in a blow to the hospitality sector, punters will only be served drinks at pubs if they eat big meals and must stay in household groups. Boris Johnson summoned his Cabinet for a rare Sunday meeting last night to sign off new, toughened measures for England. They will start after the national lockdown ends on December 2 and the country returns to regional coronavirus control tiers. Ministers yesterday confirmed a major breakthrough with administrations in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland agreeing to a a joint approach to Christmas. It is understood up to three households will be able to come together for a turkey dinner indoors, subject to final agreement with the devolved nations. There are also hopes that these ""festive bubbles"" will be able to go out for Christmas meals together — as long as they do not mingle with other households. As The Sun revealed last week, strict lockdown rules will be paused for five days. The ban on household mixing in Tiers 2 and 3 will likely be lifted for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day through to the delayed Boxing Day Bank Holiday on December 28. And in Tier 1, the ""Rule of Six"" is set to be suspended to allow bigger groups to celebrate. In a huge boost for retailers, all shops will be allowed to open in the crucial run-up to Christmas — regardless of their local lockdown measures. The Sun has learnt that gyms will also be able to open across the country. The tiers each area will be placed in will be announced on Thursday. Plans for a new stricter 4th tier have been abandoned. Most of the country is expected to return to the most stringent Tier 3 or high risk Tier 2. Tier 2 will be ""beefed up"" and it is understood that pubs will only be allowed to serve booze alongside a ""substantial meal"" and punters will only be able to dine indoors with people they live with. Pubs in Tier 3 will only be allowed to operate on a click and collect basis with no seating inside. In a glimmer of good news for pubs, the hated 10pm curfew is set to be scrapped — with an hour of drinking and eating up time allowed until 11pm. The PM will today address the Commons with his updated plans before setting out full details of a five-day Christmas relaxation of tiers later in the week. Mr Johnson is due to tell MPs the increase in new Covid cases in England is ""flattening off"" after the nationwide lockdown measures. But he will warn: ""We are not out of the woods yet."" He will unveil a testing push for Tier 3 areas. It will allow them to ""draw on the support of NHS Test and Trace and the Armed Forces"" for extensive community testing. Workers in food manufacturing, staff in prisons, and those delivering and administering Covid vaccines are also set to be offered weekly testing from December. Mr Johnson will vow that ""with the expansion in testing and vaccines edging closer to deployment, the regional tiered system will help get the virus back under control and keep it there."" More than 70 of his own MPs want rules to be relaxed after the national lockdown ends. But with Labour support, his plans are set to sail through the Commons regardless of any Tory rebellion. THANK goodness the hated 10pm curfew is for the chop. It was damaging and pointless. But we urge the Prime Minister to urgently rethink the countrywide ban on different households mixing inside which is set to replace it. Outdoor socialising was fine in May and June. But precious few will brave ice and sleet to sit in a beer garden. So the miserable intervention will surely kill hundreds of pubs and restaurants. Landlords spent fortunes on making their pubs Covid-secure before the tiers system came in. And after months of endless handwashing and social distancing, customers know exactly how to stay safe.

250,Real,The Sun,"HOME Secretary Priti Patel ""unintentionally"" broke the Cabinet rules, a Whitehall bullying probe has concluded. But Boris Johnson is unlikely to sack his close ally after her department was also blasted for poor performance. A row exploded in February after top civil servant at the Home Office Sir Philip Rutnam quit, saying Ms Patel mistreated staff by swearing and shouting - claims she has always denied. But the formal probe into the affair has concluded that her frustration with the poor leadership from officials in her department was justified, and no concerns were raised with her about bad behaviour. The investigation is likely to warn civil servants working at the Home Office must also ""reflect"" on their behaviour after ignoring Ms Patel's orders. But the Sun understands it will also flag up strict rules for ministers that state that they must treat staff with ""consideration and respect"" at all times. The Prime Minister will tomorrow rule on the formal investigation conducted by top Whitehall sleaze-buster Sir Alex Allan who advises Mr Johnson on bad behaviour. But insiders suggested Ms Patel was unlikely to face the chop due to the widespread criticism of all involved in a draft of the report. A well placed source said Mr Johnson was ""absolutely standing by Priti"". Insiders said the probe has found Ms Patel was unaware of any concerns due to a lack of leadership from senior mandarins - meaning any complaints were not able to be addressed at the time. It is understood that the report finds there has been a dramatic improvement in relations between the Home Secretary and her officials in recent months after a change of guard in the department. A summary of the findings is due to be released tomorrow, but Labour have demanded the whole document be published ""immediately"". Shadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas Symonds warned :""These revelations could not be more serious."" He added: ""This has all the hallmarks of a cover up from the Prime Minister and raises fundamental questions about his judgement."" But former Tory leaders Sir Iain Duncan Smith leapt to Ms Patel's defence, saying she ""is strong willed and determined to get the job done."" The grandee added: ""There is a history of poor civil service leadership at the Home Office and the report is critical of that. ""She is no bully but a good minister."" And Conservative MP Dr Kieran Mullan said: ""Having worked closely with Priti Patel I never saw any bullying behaviour, just someone determined.""

As The Sun revealed in August, the Chancellor has his eyes on the hallowed cash  — up to £15billion a year — to help plug the budget black hole caused by the virus. Britain is legally bound to spend 0.7 per cent of output on foreign giveaways, but on Tuesday Downing Street said the law allows that pledge to be suspended in extreme times. Mr Johnson's spokesman said: ""There may be circumstances in which the government is not able to meet 0.7% commitment – if that happens a Secretary of State has to lay a statement in parliament."" The massive hint came after Cabinet Minister Robert Jenrick said the Covid crisis meant that ""there is a legitimate question for us to ask at this moment in time whether or not it would be wise to spend somewhat less in light of the fact public finances are in a really challenging situation."" The commitment to spend 0.7p per cent of British GDP on foreign giveaways was a flagship policy for former PM David Cameron, who used to try ""modernise"" the Conservatives. But it's always been loathed by many senior Tories who resented foreign aid swelling even amid cuts to domestic spending and having their hands tied by the arbitrary figure. Although he is understood to have the backing of the PM for the move, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is pushing back on the measure. In September his department took over the Aid department and he has fought back against any attempt to divert funds ever since. When unveiling the merger in June, Boris Johnson warned the UK's aid budget would no longer be a ""giant cash point in the sky"" for countries like India and China. Mr Johnson has also signalled support for ripping  up rules on aid spending Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. He said instead the focus should be on how to use aid spending to  ""maximise British influence"" on the world stage. And while planned slashing of the aid budget would infuriate the charities and opposition parties it would delight scores of Conservative MPs who have hated it for a decade. Jeremy Hutton, a policy analyst for the Taxpayer Alliance, said: ""It's about time ministers made use of this aid loophole. ""As we've long said, the law does allow the aid budget to be slashed in a crisis.

A No10 source said: ""The atmosphere is one of reset and change and that can't happen with those two still in the building."" The PM finally lost his patience with his two enforcers after months of simmering Downing Street tensions and bitter backstabbing - sensationally banishing the guru as well as his long time spin doctor to the shock of Westminster. A source said: ""Their behaviour in the last 72 hours was toxic and Boris said enough is enough."" Insiders pointed to vicious negative briefings to the press about Ms Symonds and anonymous claims that chief Brexit negotiator David Frost could follow the pair out of the door as ""crossing the line."" Friends of Lord Frost said he was ""baffled"" by the rumour and warned it undermined his position staring down Brussels in the final stages of trade talks with the EU. Once all powerful, Mr Cummings threw in the towel on Thursday evening following ""a shouty"" confrontation with the PM over the ousting of his close ally Mr Cain. It came amid a week of spectacular briefing and counter briefing that would have made the sweary fictional aide Malcolm Tucker from the BBC's Thick of It blush. Ms Symonds and a number or powerful female No10 aides had objected to a plan to promote Mr Cain to No10 boss and told the PM directly of their concerns. That sparked the chain reaction and vicious retaliation in the press that ended with Mr Cummings last night packing up his desk and leaving with a box of his possessions for the last time. Relieved insiders compared the mood in Downing Street last night to ""thawed Narnia"" after news of the shock departures ripped through Whitehall. Last July Mr Cummings, the mastermind of the historic Brexit referendum victory in 2016, was given full control of Mr Johnson's administration when he got the keys to No10. He was known to boast that the ""Vote Leave"" gang were running the country now, and he did so with a heavy hand. Mr Cummings was regarded as being more powerful than most ministers, exerting control over the Government's agenda and demanding iron discipline from the army of Whitehall special advisers. Alongside his close ally Mr Cain, he had been accused by MPs, aides and Ms Symonds of destroying Mr Johnson's premiership with their aggressive antics and disdain for the Cabinet. The pair had been central to Mr Johnson's rise to power and stunning election victory last December, but tensions over the Covid-19 pandemic drove different factions into bloody civil war behind the famous black door of 10 Downing Street. The Vote Leave veterans were furious they had been overruled by the PM over the appointment of Allegra Stratton, a pal of Ms Symonds, to a new role as the face of No10 in planned TV briefings and saw it as shot across their bows. And Cummings and Johnson have been increasingly at odds since Mr Cummings controversial breaking lockdown-breaking trip to Barnard Castle, at the height of the pandemic. Mr Johnson battled to keep his right hand man, but it cost him dearly in the polls and with his MPs. But it was a series of high profile cockups like the A-level fiasco, Lockdown 2 leak and undignified public spat with England striker Marcus Rashford over free school meals convinced the PM that a dramatic shake up was needed in his top team. One source said: ""Dom has always been big picture and punch ups. But he has no interest and isn't very good at the day to day tedious stuff and the pandemic has made that very clear.

And now Mr Johnson is under pressure from senior Tories to ease out his controversial guru Dominic Cummings after the former Vote Leave boss threatened to walk out in the Downing Street turf war. Former BBC and ITV journalist Allegra Stratton's appointment to be the new face of No10 at daily White House style TV briefings had enraged Mr Cain, who was backed by fellow Brexiteer Mr Cummings in his demand for more powers.

259,Real,The Sun,"NEARLY two and a half tonnes of cocaine has been seized from a serving cop's house in the British Virgin Islands. The £189million stash is the equivalent to three quarters of the entire national budget of the tiny UK overseas territory in the West Indies. The record breaking raid will heap pressure on ministers to do more to tackle corruption in the troubled region that is central to the South American drug trafficking trade into the United States. The 2,300 kg stash was discovered on Friday night hidden in 63 bundles across three vehicles during a raid on a house being built by a serving officer of the Royal Virgin Island Police Force. The officer has been named as Darren Davis, 41, who has served for 20 years in the Virgin Islands Police Force. Intelligence of corruption led to a secret operation by a hand-picked group of special officers leading the charge, but the massive find stunned police chiefs in its scale. Davis and an accomplice have been arrested and his suspected criminal connections are being probed, along with any other bad apples in the force. Law enforcement sources point to possible side effects of the Covid-19 crisis meaning that large amounts of cocaine, usually bound for the United States, is being bottlenecked due to a flat drugs market and restrictions on travel. The BVI is currently under a night time curfew and private boats are not allowed on the waters after dark - meaning nefarious activity has been easier to spot. On Sunday night $99,000 in cash was seized after a high speed boat capsized after dark. Two more individuals were detained, with police investigating if there was any connection to Friday's raid. The BVI was devastated in 2017 by Hurricane Irma and has long been feared as a hotbed of corruption and drug crime. At a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, the territory's Governor Gus Jaspert said: ""This is not the work of a few criminals slipping through the crack, but strong evidence of serious and organised criminality in the British Virgin Islands."" He added ""there may be pockets of corruption facilitating this activity"" and warned ""we must act fast"" to make sure it does not spread. And he confirmed HMS Medway continues to be based in BVI waters to tackle drug smuggling at his request and he was in touch with London about the next steps. The Police Force's commissioner said the ""deep and settling"" case is one ""that will keep me up at night"", describing any suggestion of an internal corruption as a ""violation"".",Real Sun,428.0

And he said it was time for a reset after the diplomatic chaos of the Trump years, as world leaders began making overtures to the next likely White House boss. The Biden friend and Democrat colleague told the BBC: ""I would expect Mr Biden, who has deep experience in Foreign Policy, to re-engage, reimagine our alliances and our relationships, but particularly our special relationship with the United Kingdom."" He added that ""at times President Trump has strained and destabilised North Atlantic relations, the US and UK, US and EU but in particular the vital NATO strategic relationship.

""I expect Joe Biden to re-energize our focus on democracy and open society in the face of challenges from Russia, China and Iran and elsewhere in the world,"" he added.

262,Real,The Sun,"BORIS Johnson was urged last night to ensure lockdown ends on December 2. News yesterday that the furlough pay scheme will be extended led to fears the curbs will last five months. The Prime Minister said that if everyone worked together to put Covid ""back in its box"", four weeks of restrictions would be enough for ""as normal a Christmas as possible"". But senior Tories warned there could be no backsliding on the date. Rebel leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said: ""I voted against this latest lockdown because I believed we were already succeeding in getting the infection rate down. ""But now that it has happened we must absolutely — for the sake of the economy and people's livelihoods — come out on December 2 at the latest, not a day longer."" Former Cabinet Minister Theresa Villiers told The Sun: ""This lockdown must not last a day longer than December 2. ""To save the retail sector, to save the economy and to save Christmas we must come out bang on time."" We must absolutely — for the sake of the economy and people's livelihoods — come out on December 2 at the latest. Chancellor Rishi Sunak had warned of a grim winter as he was forced to pay for the jobs protection scheme until the spring — just days after saying it would not be the right thing to do. But speaking from No10 on the first day of the new national lockdown, Mr Johnson insisted there was ""light at the end of the tunnel"". The PM said the country would return to the tiered system of local lockdowns after four weeks — dismissing claims by ministers that restrictions could be extended. He said: ""These measures, though they are tough, are time-limited. The advice I have received suggests that four weeks is enough for these measures to make a real impact. ""So these rules will expire, and on December 2 we plan to move back to a tiered approach."" He added: ""I perfectly understand why people feel frustration but the overwhelming majority of people will work together again to get the R (rate) down. ""We can do this and we will do this by December 2 and I have every confidence that if we follow this package of measures, I have no doubt people will have as normal a Christmas as possible and we will be able to get things open before Christmas too. That is the objective"" At the same press conference, NHS England chief Sir Simon Stevens took a more cautious note, suggesting ""we will know conclusively"" on December 2 whether the measures were working — rather than saying they would end then. The PM's pledge came as statistics watchdogs slammed his use of data to convince the country of the need for harsher restrictions. The UK Statistics Authority hit out following criticism of modelling used at Saturday's Downing Street press conference to announce the latest lockdown in England, which suggested deaths could reach 4,000 a day unless action was taken. They said: ""The use of data has not consistently been supported by transparent information being provided in a timely manner. ""As a result, there is potential to confuse the public and undermine confidence in the statistics."" Hitting back, Mr Johnson said: ""We try to make things as clear as we possibly can."" By Nick McDermott, Health Editor NHS boss Sir Simon Stevens showed just one slide during last night's Downing Street briefing. Gone were the widely discredited dodgy predictions of 4,000 daily deaths. Instead, he revealed that two months ago, 500 Covid patients were taking up hospital beds. Now there are 11,000. He also said that, in comparison, there are 7,000 cancer patients on wards and 3,000 flu. But context is key too. There are still 11,000 more spare NHS beds than there were a year ago. He acknowledged that the ""projections vary widely"" and there was also a ""political judgment"" to be made, taking into account the economic consequences. He added: ""It's very, very tough to make exactly the right call."" In a split, Sir Simon directly criticised government doctors Professor Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance's use of data at press conferences, saying it was at times ""a bit hard to keep up with"". He displayed one simple chart showing the number of patients being looked after in hospitals across England. He said: ""It's the equivalent of 22 of our hospitals across England full of coronavirus patients. ""Those are facts, those are not projections, forecasts, speculations, those are the patients in the hospital today."" Mr Johnson also came under pressure to explain falling Covid numbers in London which suggested his tiered system was beginning to work. Yesterday data showed that in 19 out of 32 London boroughs, cases of the virus had gone down after two weeks of Tier 2 rules. In 11 boroughs the decline was by more than ten per cent. Last night Downing Street claimed the ""measures we had in place were working in suppressing the virus's natural rate of spread"" but said more had to be done ""to go further and protect the NHS.""

265,Real,The Sun,"ALL of England will need to be under severe Tier 3 Covid restrictions by mid-December, gloomy scientists have told ministers. It has dashed Boris Johnson's hopes of a Christmas reprieve from lockdown rules. The Government's Sage advisory body has warned that by the festive season, virus rates all over the country will soar past the levels seen in areas already put into the ""very high"" category. The Sun has learned that the latest government modelling overseen by chief scientist Sir Patrick Vallance shows more than 25,000 will be in hospital with the virus by the end of November — higher than the spring peak. That is also more than double the 9,199 who were battling the bug in hospital yesterday. It comes as officials predict the second Covid wave could be even deadlier than the first, with a ""lower but longer peak"". No10 assumes the death toll this winter is going to be worse than that experienced by the UK in the spring. Meanwhile, a top police chief has warned cops will be able to burst into homes this Christmas to disrupt family gatherings - but says he fears tightening restrictions will spark riots. West Mids police and crime commissioner David Jamieson says the country is ""sitting on a time bomb"", with violence likely to boil over when the furlough scheme ends this month. And yesterday, the UK recorded its highest daily coronavirus death toll since May, with a further 367 fatalities and another 22,885 cases confirmed. The number of deaths is the highest daily figure since May 27, when 422 were reported. On average, 200 coronavirus deaths have been reported every day in the UK over the past week. Sir Patrick had warned the Covid second wave would not hit that grim milestone until mid-November. It is understood that new modelling prepared by the scientific advisory committee shows a far starker picture than originally feared, with the whole country needing the toughest restrictions in December. A government source said: ""The latest Sage numbers are utterly bleak."" Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director of Public Health England, last night warned that the rising death toll from Covid-19 was likely to continue for some time. The grim medical warnings are a fresh headache for Mr Johnson who is being put under huge pressure by his backbenchers to set out a clear path out of lockdown for those regions currently in Tier 3, predominantly in the North. More than eight million people in England will be under the most stringent restrictions by the end of the week amid fears West Yorkshire is next. Nottingham is due to face the stringent measures tomorrow. Tier 3 means people are banned from household mixing - and people wouldn't be able to spend Christmas with their loved ones unless they were already living together. Mr Johnson's close Tory ally Jake Berry now heads up a 50-strong grouping of Northern MPs who are demanding ""a clear road map"" for the region to relax rules. The MP said yesterday: ""Our constituents have been some of the hardest hit by this virus, with many losing jobs, businesses and livelihoods. ""Never has there been a more pertinent and urgent political and economic case to support people living in the North."" Mr Berry's new Northern Research Group insist they are trying to help the Prime Minister. One member, Barrow and Furness Conservative MP Simon Fell, told Times Radio they were ""trying to essentially keep the Government honest on its promises to the North"". He insisted they ""want to be a friendly and helpful voice"". But a Whitehall source told The Sun: ""The exit path these guys want does not exist yet."" Business Minister Nadhim Zahawi insisted that Tier 3 areas were subject to 28-day reviews but warned virus levels were still too high to begin relaxing any curbs. And Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson has backed the idea of a possible fourth tier of coronavirus restrictions if Tier 3 measures do not go far enough to halt the spread of Covid-19. The city is one of five northern locations currently under the strictest curbs. But Mr Anderson, whose brother Bill was one of 61 people to die with the virus in the city in one week, told the BBC he was not opposed to the introduction of ""tougher measures if necessary"". Meanwhile, experts have warned that closing parks and libraries during lockdown could have a lasting effect on babies and toddlers. Researchers found three-quarters of young children spent more time watching TV or playing with a tablet due to Covid-19 restrictions. Youngsters from disadvantaged families were more likely to be staring at screens than reading books, exercising and doing other ""enriching activities"". The University of Oxford's Alex Hendry said: ""It is clear that during lockdown some babies have been missing out."" And Dr Nayeli Gonzalez-Gomez, of Oxford Brookes University, added: ""The closure of playgrounds and libraries has disproportionately impacted children from disadvantaged backgrounds.

Younger adults aged 18-54 are significantly less likely than the over 55s to believe those that watch TV but never the BBC should have to pay for a Licence Fee.

""Defund the BBC"" campaign chief Rebecca Ryan told The Sun: ""This poll clearly demonstrates that the British public is overwhelmingly opposed to the Licence Fee in its current form. ""There are rightly serious concerns over the way that the Licence Fee is spent, particularly given the eye watering sums paid to certain BBC presenters."" She added: ""It is also extremely worrying that the BBC has alienated such huge swathes of British people who do not think it represents their values. ""Decriminalising the Licence Fee is just the first step to radical reform. The next move is to ensure the Licence Fee only covers BBC output."" Last night a BBC spokesman hit back: ""We know from wide-ranging research that 91% of UK adults use BBC television, radio or online every week and surveys consistently show that the Licence Fee is the public's preferred way of funding the BBC. That model is in place until at least 2027."" A POLL revealed by The Sun today proves what we've suspected for a while — the BBC is in deep, deep trouble. Almost two in three Brits say the TV licence fee must be reformed, a third say the cash is spent ""unreasonably'' — and one in six say they never even watch the Beeb. It's time Parliament listened to them. Decriminalising non-payment of the fee will be a start. But the Government should go further and revive its plan to fund the service with a subscription model. Media luvvies squeal at the thought: they think that scrapping the licence fee would kill the Beeb off. But they're wrong. A subscription model — in which ordinary viewers beyond London would have more stake than ever before in what shows they watch — would give tired old Auntie a new lease of life. The BBC will always be a beloved British institution. But to stay relevant, it must start reflecting the REAL modern Britain.",Real Sun,647.0
273,Real,The Sun,"FAMILIES face a £94 hit to their household budgets unless Rishi Sunak drops plans to restore VAT on masks back at 20 per cent. Labour last night accused the Chancellor of slapping Brits with a ""mask tax"" after the Treasury refused to extend a VAT pause on PPE after the end of October. VAT at 20 per cent on masks and other vital equipment like disposable gloves will line their coffers to the tune of £85million a month. But over the next six months this would cost the average household nearly almost £4 a week. For a family of four – two adults and two teenagers – using disposable masks, that could mean spending an extra £94 over the next six months, Labour analysis claims. Mr Sunak had suspended VAT charges on PPE on May 1, and is currently refusing to extend it beyond the end of this month. Sources say the price of PPE has plummeted now as supply has caught up with the surge in demand, but Labour says it's unfair as wearing them is compulsory. A Treasury spokesman said: ""Our temporary zero-rate of VAT on PPE was designed to help sectors that cannot recover VAT on such goods due to their VAT exempt status, such as care homes."" ""Health have committed in the Winter Plan to provide free PPE for Covid-19 need to adult social care until March 2021 through their stockpile, ensuring a stable supply of PPE. The temporary zero-rate on PPE is therefore no longer required."" ""The relief was to ensure front line workers got the protection they needed & that remains our priority"" But shadow treasury minister James Murray hit back: ""It's unbelievable that the Government wants to introduce a mask tax in the middle of a pandemic. ""With Covid cases on the rise across the country, the government should be doing all it can to help people follow its own guidance to wear a mask, not ramping up the cost of buying one."" The Labour MP added: ""Families across the country are already struggling financially as a result of the crisis. The last thing they need is to be penalised for doing the right thing."" A recent poll by YouGov found three in 10 used disposable masks. A box of 20 single use face masks from Boots costs £12.99.",Real Sun,386.0

The French President unveiled his ""la regle c'est six maximum"" or ""the rule is six maximum"" slogan as he slapped a 9pm curfew on Paris and other cities. In a long prime time TV address to the French people on Wednesday night, Mr Macron said: ""When we invite friends to the house we shouldn't be more than six round the table."" ""In restaurants, we say no more than six people around the table,"" he added. ""As a maximum, in our private lives, we need to do this."" But eagle-eyed Brits quickly spotted it was a direct rip off of the British ""rule of six"" that Mr Johnson introduced last month to outlaws big groups meeting up. And it's not the first time Mr Macron has turned to Britain for inspiration for his virus tackling measures. In May, after Downing Street downgraded their order to Brits from ""stay at home"" to ""stay alert"", the French copied that too. Macron unveiled the ""restez prudents"" tagline, which roughly translates to ""stay cautious"". At the time Mr Johnson was widely criticised for the confusing slogan, but said he was ""interested"" to see that the French government adopt it shortly after. He told a No10 press conference: ""For those who think that the stay alert is not the right message, I think it is absolutely the right message for our country now.""

I didn't collude with him to make these allegations go away."" She read out the messages between the pair to Sophy Ridge on Sky News. Allies of Mr Salmond — her ex-mentor, who she hasn't spoken to for more than two years — had accused her of hiding the texts from a Scottish parliamentary probe into the claims. But a source close to Mr Salmond said: ""The First Minister is lashing out on TV about matters which should properly be dealt with in front of the parliamentary committee."" Scottish Tories asked: ""If Alex Salmond asked the First Minister to collude with her to cover up these allegations, shouldn't that have been reported to the government or police?""

The former Tory Cabinet Minister says the Town Hall-led and charity-run project would soften the impact of job losses sparked by the virus. As Pensions Secretary between 2010 and 2016, Sir Iain pioneered the benefit reform that streamlined welfare into a single monthly payment. Now, he is backing a report published today by the Centre for Social Justice aimed at helping welfare claimants ""tackle barriers to personal progress"" by ""bolstering people's economic, physical, mental and social wellbeing"".

But ministers have told the Trade Union Congress that its public funding will be switched off from the end of this financial year. They insist the cash will instead go toward the Government's new £2.5 billion National Skills Fund unveiled by the Prime Minister last week as part of his pledge to give every adult without A-levels free college courses and loans to retrain. But union bosses are up in arms, claiming the move is totally unfair and are demanding urgent talks. In a letter to the TUC this week, The Sun understands that skills minister Gillian Keegan told General Secretary Frances O'Grady ""the decision is final."" Ms Keegan wrote: ""I appreciate this will not be welcome news for you, but it is important to emphasise that it is in the context of an overall commitment to supporting those in work to develop skills and to progress to more senior and productive roles.""

280,Real,The Sun,"BORIS Johnson is grappling with the desperately difficult decision of whether to plunge millions in the North back into tougher lockdown. The Prime Minister offered a vision of hope yesterday but admitted Britain still faces one of history's ""darkest moments"" with Covid cases soaring again. He warned we must fight ""night and day to repel this virus"" but there is ""simply no reasonable alternative"" to restrictions. Pubs and restaurants face closure in Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle, with Chancellor Rishi Sunak scrambling to put together a local bailout package for businesses facing ruin. Some shops could also be forced to shut, but workplaces and schools would remain open. Mr Johnson's message came after Downing Street was hit with a ""white-faced briefing"" from senior medics about soaring virus numbers in the North West and North East. It prompted the PM to delay his plan to replace complex local lockdown rules with a simpler traffic light system. A No 10 source said: ""The numbers are going the wrong way, and there will come a point very soon where we simply have to do more."" Nationwide, the daily infection rate was 14,542 — up around 2,000 in 24 hours — with 76 deaths. The worst-hit area is Manchester, where 3,105 new cases were recorded in the seven days to October 3 — the equivalent of 561.6 per 100,000 people. That is up from 261.2 in the week before. Merseyside is next, with Knowsley and Liverpool both recording sharp rises over 500 per 100,000, followed by Newcastle upon Tyne. The UK-wide seven-day average rate stands at 125.7 cases per 100,000, up from 63.8 a week ago. Some 478 people were taken to hospital in England with Covid on Sunday, the most in four months, and up from 241 a week earlier. Alarm bells are also ringing across the North West about rising numbers admitted to hospital. The region saw 208 people admitted in one day on October 4, the highest single total since the end of April. Nationwide there were 2,833 patients in hospital with Covid on Tuesday, up from 1,881 a week earlier, and 393 on ventilators, compared with 259 seven days ago. But Northern Mayors have clubbed together to oppose new lockdown measures today - saying they are not working and the 10pm curfew is even counter-productive. The leaders of Leeds, Manchester and Newcastle city councils - Judith Blake, Sir Richard Leese and Nick Forbes - joined Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson to write to the Health Secretary to say they are ""extremely concerned"" with the rise in cases. ""The existing restrictions are not working, confusing for the public and some, like the 10pm rule, are counter-productive,"" the Labour politicians wrote. They called for additional powers to punish those who break rules, and for new restrictions to be developed by police, council and public health experts and for a locally-controlled test and trace system. They added: ""We want to be clear however that we do not support further economic lockdowns."" In his Tory party conference speech, Mr Johnson admitted: ""I have had more than enough of this disease that attacks not only human beings but so many of the greatest things about our country — our pubs, our clubs, our football, our theatre and all the gossipy gregariousness and love of human contact that drives the creativity of our economy."" He insisted that if we obey the rules the country will beat the virus ""just as this country has seen off every alien invader for the last thousand years"". Addressing the annual conference, which is being held virtually because of the pandemic, the PM appeared to suggest restrictions will be over by this time next year. He told party members that ""next time we meet it will be face to face and cheek by jowl, and we are working for the day when life will be back to normal"". However Mr Johnson is facing a growing rebellion from Tory MPs ahead of Commons votes to approve the 10pm pub curfew. Tonight 17 voted against a government motion approving the ""rule of six"" — with ex-ministers breaking cover to slam it. The rebels included former Cabinet minister Esther McVey, Tory grandee Sir Graham Brady and powerful committee bosses Huw Merriman and William Wragg. Labour also hinted they could stand against the curfew in a vote which may be held next week. Mr Johnson insisted he ""deeply regretted"" taking tough measures. The PM said: ""This government has been forced by the pandemic into erosions of liberty that we deeply regret and to an expansion in the role of the state from lockdown enforcement to the many bailouts and subsidies that go against our instincts. ""But we accept them because there is simply no reasonable alternative."" But former Tory Chancellor Norman Lamont said he feared Britain was turning into a ""nation of informers"". He told the House of Lords: ""It's one thing to report your neighbour if you see that he is building a bomb factory. ""If he is holding a barbecue for seven people are you really going to report him?

Echoing his streamlining of social mixing regulations into a simpler ""rule of six"" the PM wants to implement a new tier system for threat level as soon as possible. Officials are working around the clock to flesh out the clearer system after the PM and his ministers were humiliated on the airwaves over their own confusion at the rules that can vary town to town. Each threat level would have different restrictions linked to them, based on the number of local cases. Areas with around 100 cases per 100,000 would qualify for tier one status according to an early draft of the plan and see greater enforcement of social distancing and mask wearing. But if cases rose above that, such as in the North, then they would be classed as Tier 2 and see bans on household gatherings. If that failed to work, areas could hit Tier 3 and be placed in to a more extreme form of lockdown that could see pubs, restaurants and shops ordered to shut in order to keep schools and other workplaces open Last night the Department of Health insisted that no changes to the local lockdown measures were imminent, but Downing Street did not deny the plan. No10 insisted: ""We keep all of the measures which we put in place under review - if there is anything further to set out then we will do so to the House"".

The PM caved in to a Tory rebellion and gave MPs the right to veto tougher virus rules. But he stood by his key advisers' gloomy forecasts and warned he would not hesitate to impose a second lockdown. And defying dozens of party critics, he insisted he would not soften measures and ""let the virus take its course"" as the death toll would be too high. Instead, Mr Johnson pleaded with everyone to show ""collective forbearance, commonsense and a willingness to make sacrifices for others"". He stressed: ""No matter how impatient, how fed up we may become, there is only one way of doing this."" He said if people did not comply and, if the evidence required it, he would quickly take further measures. No matter how impatient, how fed up we may become, there is only one way of doing this. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance added: ""We don't have this under control at the moment. There's no cause for complacency."" The warnings came as the UK saw 7,108 new cases — as well as 71 deaths for the second day running. Chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said hospital and intensive care figures were going in the wrong direction, adding: ""We've got a long winter ahead of us."" He singled out the North East, North West and London where there was a significant rise in people entering intensive care. There were 312 patients in mechanical ventilator beds as of Tuesday and 2,252 patients in hospital, as reported on Monday. Mr Johnson said: ""This remains a national threat and a national challenge. It's down to all of us."" But he warned he would ""bear down on the virus where we need to do that most"". In a dig at Tories demanding a softening of measures, the PM said: ""I know that some people think that we should give up and let the virus take its course, despite the huge loss of life that would potentially entail. ""But I profoundly disagree and I don't think it's what the British people want. ""I don't think they want to throw in the sponge. They want to fight and defeat this virus and this is what we're going to do."" This remains a national threat and a national challenge. It's down to all of us. In a glimmer of good news, Prof Whitty revealed that the reopening of schools was not having a major impact on spreading the virus. Mr Johnson, asked for his honest assessment of whether further nationwide restrictions were on the way, added: ""The answer is, I'm afraid, entirely dependent on how effective we are now in collectively driving down the virus. ""We know we can do it because we did it in March and April. ""What we hope is that if people obey the guidance in the way they can and have in the past we will get the spread down again. ""I'm confident we can do it. But our success will have to be judged in the days and weeks ahead. ""It is still too early to tell whether that package of measures will be successful."" His plea came after Government whips held tense talks with Tory rebels who rose up against further tough measures. Up to 100 party MPs were said to be ready to defeat tonight's extension of emergency Covid powers given to ministers in March. MPs demanded a say over future law changes amid fury over how the rule of six and pub clampdown were introduced without being voted on. Earlier, Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle told the Commons: ""The way in which the government has exercised its powers to make secondary legislation during this crisis has been totally unsatisfactory."" Tonight, Health Secretary Matt Hancock promised MPs a vote ""wherever possible"" before any new rules came into force. Sir Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 committee, had been pushing for MPs to have more of a say over restrictions. Tonight, he called off the rebellion, saying: ""Members on both sides understand the importance of ministers having the freedom to act quickly when it's necessary but we are grateful that ministers have understood the importance of proper scrutiny in Parliament."" IT was a mistake for the Prime Minister to introduce a slew of bewildering new Covid rules that not even his ministers could get their heads around. And digging his heels in now — in the face of enormous resistance from his own backbenchers and the public — is an even bigger risk. Brits were happy to trust the Government absolutely at the peak of lockdown, despite various missteps. But six months on, after lots of false promises, a string of U-turns and masses of evidence that the second wave is nowhere near as deadly as the first, the PM must know that goodwill is fast draining away. And that the harder he pushes, the more people will push back. Of course, we welcome news that Britain is on track to hit the 500,000 tests a day target by the end of October.

More than 50 Tories have publicly slammed the proposal, although the Speaker of the Commons may dash their hopes of a formal showdown by not calling their planned protest amendment on Wednesday evening. Tonight Downing Street rejected Mr Baker's charge, saying Mr Johnson ""is responsible for all the decisions he takes as prime minister."" Tory former minister Sir Desmond Swayne called for Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance to be sacked as government advisers. He told the Commons: ""Less than a year ago, I celebrated what I thought was the election of a sceptical and liberal-conservative administration. ""And now I am left wondering if the Prime Minister hasn't been abducted by Dr Strangelove and reprogrammed by the Sage over to the dark side. The purpose of politicians is to impose a measure of proportion, a sense of proportion on science, and not to be enthralled to it. ""Now I will make myself very unpopular, but I believe that the appearance of the chiefs (chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance) last week should have been a sacking offence. ""When they presented that graph, with the caveat that it wasn't a prediction, but nevertheless it was clear that they presented it as a plausible scenario, with its 50,000 cases per day by mid-October based on the doubling of infections by the week. ""Not once, not on one day since March have there been infections on that day that were double that of the day of the week proceeding. Not once. Where did this doubling come from? What was their purpose in presenting such a graph? ""It was the purpose of the Fat Boy in Pickwick Papers, 'I wants to make yer flesh creep'. It was project fear, it was an attempt to terrify the British people, as if they haven't been terrified enough.""",Real Sun,541.0
289,Real,The Sun,"BORIS Johnson is plotting a Covid rules ""enforcement blitzkrieg"" tomorrow after Britain's top scientists warned Britain could see 200 deaths a day again by November. The clampdown will see pubs and restaurants shut down by patrols if they allow punters to flout the ""rule of six"" - and groups could be broken up and fined. After shocking warnings from chief medic Chris Whitty that the UK death total could yet soar by thousands, Mr Johnson is preparing  to unveil a package of tough new measures. Ahead of a COBRA meeting of ministers and law enforcement tomorrow morning, a senior Whitehall source told The Sun: ""Every option comes with a very big stick."" In a Cabinet conference call on Saturday, ministers were warned that the death toll in the UK could yet soar by thousands if action is not taken now. But Mr Johnson is under massive pressure from his top team not to plunge Britain into a further economic crisis with more stringent lockdown measures like completely closing the hospitality sector. A government source said: ""Police and councils will be told to act immediately when they see the rules being broken. ""Lots of pubs and restaurants are following the law, but others are not. ""Those that flout it will be shut down."" Police are currently using a ""4 Es"" strategy - ""Engage, Explain, Encourage, Enforce"" - to implement the virus rules. But some Ministers want the Enforcement option to be increased before further lockdown measures are imposed. Police guidance states ""officers may remove a person to the place where they live, using reasonable force only if it is a necessary and proportionate means of ensuring compliance"" during the Enforcement phase. The Sun understands a range of new enforcement measures will be pushed by the Prime Minister in an address to the nation pencilled in for tomorrow evening after updating MPs on Tuesday morning. It will sit alongside the measures to limit ""unnecessary social contact"" hinted at by Mr Whitty on Monday. In a bleak press conference, Mr Whitty and Chief Scientist Sir Patrick Vallance warned the daily death rate would return to hundreds per day by November if the virus cases are allowed to continue doubling every seven days. Britain could face 50,000 new coronavirus cases a day in just three weeks and deaths could soar if the bug continues to spread at its current rate. Sir Patrick warned: ""In every age group we have seen an increase… It is now estimated that roughly 70,000 people in the UK have Covid infection and that about 6,000 people per day are getting the infection. ""If that continues unabated and this grows doubling every seven days then what you see… is by mid October we would end up with something like 50,000 cases per day."" Professor Whitty added that everyone has a part to play in stopping the disease, saying: ""This is not someone else's problem, this is all of our problems. ""We must see this as a six month problem – we have to take this collectively very seriously."" Earlier this morning Matt Hancock hinted that pubs may face extra curbs from this weekend. Mr Hancock said ""no final decisions"" have been made but warned Brits they could face even tighter restrictions as the UK tries desperately to get a second wave of the virus under control.",Real Sun,557.0

The PM was upset by the Democratic Presidential hopeful's jibe at his plan to tweak last year's EU divorce deal. Mr Biden tweeted: ""We can't allow the Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland to become a casualty of Brexit."" But Mr Johnson's spokesman suggested Mr Biden did not understand the issues. It echoes Donald Trump, who has repeatedly attacked Mr Biden as ""Sleepy Joe"", saying he gets confused and is prone to gaffes. Downing Street said: ""We continue to remain absolutely committed to no hard border and no border infrastructure between the Republic and Northern Ireland"" Asked if Mr Biden was wrong, the spokesman replied: ""We will continue to work with our US partners to ensure our position is understood but the whole point of this — as the Prime Minister has set out — is to make sure the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement is upheld."" WHAT does Joe Biden hope to achieve, cluelessly blundering into the row over the Brexit deal . . . and threatening Britain? You don't need to be fans of Donald Trump to think the doddery Democrat should try to grasp our case as well as the EU's (or, more specifically, Ireland's). The reality is that a Biden-run America would be even less keen on the UK than it was under his old boss Barack Obama. But if that happens, so be it. While a historic trade deal would be great for Brits and Americans, standing up for our rights as a newly independent nation must come first. And that, for all the furore over his tactics, is what Boris Johnson is doing. Mr Biden's comments came just hours after the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he trusted the Brits to get it right. And former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith told Mr Biden to worry more about ""killing and rioting"" in the US.

291,Real,The Sun,"THE MP wife of ""Naughty Tory"" Charlie Elphicke stunned Westminster when she revealed she was backing his appeal – just weeks after dumping him after he was convicted of sexual assault. Former MP Elphicke, 49, was jailed for two years on Tuesday for groping two women in attacks nine years apart. The court heard how he had used his position and influence to exert power over both victims. Mum-of-two Natalie, 49, stood by her husband throughout his trial as she found out for the first time about his cheating. After his conviction she announced she was divorcing him due to his betrayal. But now Natalie, who took over as Dover's Conservative MP from her husband last December, is now backing his appeal, saying he has had an unfair trial. Here she tells The Sun's HARRY COLE why she has made the extraordinary decision to stand by her husband, once described in court as a ""sexual predator"". And she reveals details of the extraordinary night he turned up on her doorstep begging for help. ""MEN sometimes stray, wives always wish they wouldn't. During the past three years I learned a lot about Charlie mucking around with other women, which I would rather not have known. During the trial the court was told about an affair he had — not with either of the women who were his accusers in court. Naturally, I was furious about it, as I knew the woman involved. It was obvious to me from reading the evidence during lockdown that the criminal allegations against him were complete nonsense, and I still believe they are. Indeed, Charlie told me he ended the affair because he was concerned that I might get suspicious. As well as his disloyalty, I couldn't believe his stupidity. She was so embarrassingly and gushingly obsessed with him that at one point I banned him from driving her home, lest he be tempted. And of course, it turned out to be so. But a consensual affair, however wrongful in his marriage to me, is a very different thing from being accused of sex crimes. Charlie is charming, wealthy, charismatic and successful — attractive, and attracted to, women. All things that in today's climate made him an easy target for dirty politics and false allegations. So I resolved to stand by him while he fought off these allegations in court and decided that I would leave him after that. It didn't quite work out that way. Following an unfair trial during the Covid-19 pandemic, I believe that Charlie was convicted in a terrible miscarriage of justice. It was obvious to me from reading the evidence during lockdown that the criminal allegations against him were complete nonsense, and I still believe they are. If you're a survivor of sexual assault, help is available at The Survivors Trust. Go to: thesurvivorstrust. org or call 08088 010818 He is appealing his sentence and the verdict. I fully support him in that. Following the trial I was so angry that I marched off, publicly called an end to our marriage and filed for divorce, as I had intended. I told The Sun of the hurt that had been inflicted on our entire family and how Charlie could get his things and go. It didn't quite work out like that either. Because Charlie turned up on the doorstep begging to be let in. It turned out the judge had ordered that he live at our home. And then she immediately went on holiday. So I had little option but to exile him to the spare room downstairs while I began mentally and physically deleting memories of 25 years of marriage. Charlie, meanwhile, began preparing for the nightmare of being sentenced. Then calls, letters and cards started rolling in to each of us. He had so many messages of support after the verdict. Person after person messaged about the difference Charlie had made for our community over years of public service. People wrote of his individual kindnesses and the help he had given to them. Help that had made a real difference in so many cases. But a consensual affair, however wrongful in his marriage to me, is a very different thing from being accused of sex crimes. We discussed his sentence. I looked at the guidelines. It seemed clear to me that community service should be ordered. A senior probation officer filed a report agreeing a community sentence was appropriate. But always the concern had to be that the court could be on a mission in sentencing, as I believed they had been during the trial. So he might get sent to jail. And so it has turned out to be. Yet another injustice heaped on so very many that started all the way back when he was denounced publicly in November 2017. Back then he was not even told by the Chief Whip, who very publicly suspended him, who had made accusations or what they were. Since then, it has been a shocking and appalling cascade of calamity. The more I saw of the messages of support and the more I saw of Charlie looking after our son, the more I was reminded of the Charlie I met all those years ago.",Real Sun,872.0

His broadside came after a furious spat with the EU over new legislation that could let him overwrite parts of the divorce deal.

295,Real,The Sun,"MINISTERS published legal advice yesterday justifying their new Internal Markets Bill despite admitting it breaches international law - and they thumbed their nose at Remainers with it. The legal document cited ultra-remain campaigner Gina Miller's successful suing of the Government over Brexit as a precedent. Remainers gave the government a bloody nose in 2017 after their case forced ministers to get Parliamentary approval to trigger Brexit. Downing Street's lawyers pointed out that Miller's case proved Parliament's will trumped international treaties and used their bitter sweet victory against them. Although ministers admit their plan would breach international law, yesterday the Government published legal advice stating it was not ""unconstitutional"" as Parliament is ""sovereign as a matter of domestic law and can pass legislation which is in breach of the UK's treaty obligations"". But the Internal Markets Bill, that drives a coach and horses through the Withdrawal Agreement, faces a tricky passage through the House of Lords. Even Brexit backing peers Lord Howard and Lord Lamont balked at the measures last night. The Former Chancellor Lord Lamont said Downing Street was in a ""terrible mess"" over the plan. He said: ""I think the Government will have to think again. I don't think this is going to get through the Lords in its present form.

Ministers want to task the army of uniformed busybodies with ""directing pedestrians, providing information, cleaning touch-points, preventing mixing between groups and being a point of contact for information on government guidelines"". They will also give out hand sanitiser and face coverings but not be able to slap rule-breakers with fines for bad behaviour. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ""We are encouraging the introduction of Covid-secure marshals to help support our high streets and public spaces, making sure that people feel safe to enjoy them."" And they insisted the new marshals will  make sure the public are ""following the guidelines in a friendly way"" after claims the Government is unleashing a ""Stasi"" style clampdown on Britain's streets. There has been mystery around exactly what powers the marshals will have after the Prime Minister announced their creation on Wednesday while issuing sweeping curbs on freedoms to tackle soaring Covid cases. Boris Johnson told a Downing Street press conference: ""We will boost the local enforcement capacity of local authorities by introducing Covid-secure marshals to help ensure social distancing in town and city centres, and by setting up a register of environmental health officers that local authorities can draw upon for support."" But the Local Government Association said on Thursday: ""We need to quickly see further detail on how the Government's Covid-19-secure marshal scheme is intended to work, and any new responsibilities for councils in this area will have to be fully funded."" MHCLG responded: ""Some areas of the country have already introduced marshals to support the public in following the guidelines in a friendly way and we will be working with local authorities to see where else they are needed. We will be setting out further details in due course."" Marshals have already been deployed by Leeds City Council and Cornwall Council. Other local authorities will now be ""encouraged"" to hire marshals, or use volunteers and existing council employees, with money from their own budgets, a MHCLG spokeswoman said. They said they would probably wear high-visibility clothing to ""support members of the public in one-way systems and remind them of guidelines"". But the latest Coronavirus measures have been branded the ""greatest invasion of personal liberty in our entire history"" beyond what happened in World War Two by a former Supreme Court judge. Lord Sumption - nicknamed Britain's cleverest man - savaged plans like the  marshals saying people are going to be too scared to go back to work. He said: ""If you are going to inaugurate the greatest invasion of personal liberty in our entire history, even including wartime measures, if you dare to do that, then you have to move straight into justification mode. ""The government has now found itself trapped in a position where, first of all, it has to exaggerate the extent of the problem in order to justify its past actions.

He added: ""The use of fear has, of course, been noticed by many people. And some members of Sage have made public statements since then saying that this was perhaps overdone, but it was a matter of deliberate policy, as it quite clearly was.

Diners received a state-backed 50% discount on meals and soft drinks up to £10 each between Mondays and Wednesdays in August.

The Job Retention Scheme set up in March paid furloughed workers 80 per cent of their wages from the public purse. That drops to 70 per cent this month and then 60 per cent in October before its planned conclusion on November 1. Labour and some senior Conservatives are calling for an extension to the scheme. Former Tory Cabinet Minister Stephen Crabb told HuffPost UK: ""There are still many firms in different sectors that simply cannot operate in the current scenario. ""There is a real danger that the unwinding of furlough will lead to the loss of thousands more high-value jobs ""Germany, which knows all about retaining domestic industrial strength, has just decided to continue its furlough scheme for another 12 months."" But last night the Treasury firmly slapped down the calls to extend the scheme. And Chancellor Rishi Sunak's firm stance was backed by Mr Johnson who said: ""We have been clear that we cannot sustain the situation indefinitely. There isn't any change to the position."" His official spokesman added: ""By the time the furlough scheme ends, we will have paid wages for eight months saving 9.6 million jobs."" The Treasury said: ""The end of the furlough scheme is not the end of our support for jobs. For businesses that can successfully bring furloughed employees back to work, this includes a £1,000 job retention bonus."" But the Institute for Public Policy Research think tank said ending the arrangement too quickly would be ""an historic mistake"". It added: ""Reforming and extending the scheme now could prevent jobs losses and boost the economy in this time of need.""

303,Real,The Sun,"FOREIGN aid is set to be axed to help foot the UK's Covid-19 bill. Britain has a legal commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of its GDP on foreign projects. But Chancellor Rishi Sunak has indicated that the amount — up to £15billion a year — could be sacrificed to help plug the budget black hole caused by coronavirus. Instead, some money could be used to fund Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence projects, and invested in the charities sector. Rich countries such as China, led by President Xi Jinping, and India, have benefited from UK taxpayers' cash. Foreign aid has included funding for dementia care in the Chinese province of Qingdao and yoga lessons for Indians at risk of heart failure. Mr Sunak believes he has the backing of the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary for the big move. But they are all aware it will require primary legislation to come into effect, which could take months. Mr Sunak wants to use his November Budget to ""announce the intention"" to scrap it, multiple sources say. But ex-deputy PM Damian Green said the idea made him ""wince"". The commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of GDP on foreign giveaways was a flagship policy of ex-PM David Cameron. It is loathed by many senior Tories who resented foreign aid growing even amid spending cuts at home. News of its demise comes as the International Aid department ceases to exist this week after it was swallowed into the Foreign Office. When he unveiled the merger in June, Boris Johnson said the aid budget would no longer be a ""giant cashpoint in the sky"" for countries like India and China.",Real Sun,277.0

We would love to make it more widely available."" Imports from New Zealand are currently hit with a 20 per cent import tax set by the EU — and that could end after Brexit.

Home Secretary Priti Patel is understood to be ""furious"" at the latest attempt to stop Britain clamping down on dangerous migrant crossings in the English Channel. A Whitehall source said ""there was 100 per cent legal attrition rate on the flight due to unprecedented and organised casework barriers sprung on the government by three law firms."" The Sun has learnt that all 23 were represented by Duncan Lewis, John Street or Milestone solicitors and all were classed as a risk to themselves or others in detention. The Madrid authorities had agreed to take back 20 migrants who had passed through Spain on their attempted journey to Britain.

A Home Office Spokesperson said: ""The Government's efforts to facilitate entirely legitimate and legal returns of people who have entered the U. K. through illegal routes are too often frustrated by last minute challenges submitted hours before a scheduled flight. ""These claims are very often baseless and entirely without merit, but are given full legal consideration, leading to removal being rescheduled. This can effectively result in the timing out of a return due to stringent Dublin Regulations."" A source added: ""Due to a high volume of last-minute legal challenges which needed time for consideration, today's flight was paused.

306,Real,The Sun,"MATT Hancock opened a Cabinet rift today after saying he didn't care that his civil servants are working home - despite desperate pleas from Boris Johnson for Whitehall officials to return to their desks. The Health Secretary said he was concerned how his civil servants ""perform"" in their jobs rather than whether or not they return to the office - in direct contradiction to the PM's orders. Cabinet ministers have been infuriated by the ""ghost ship"" departments that they wanted to fill to set an example to the rest of Britain that it's time to go back to work. In July Whitehall bosses were ordered to  'change the default that civil servants should work from home, and accelerate the return to the workplace from August 1'. But amid claims only one in 20 are back in Westminster, Downing Street has consistently refused to publish how many civil servants are back at work. Mr Hancock claimed he had ""absolutely no idea"" how many of his officials were at their desks. Downing Street declined to comment on Mr Hancock's words, but a No 10 source said: ""The PM has made his views about this very clear and has said a lot on the subject."" The slap down came after CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn urged the Government to lead firms in getting staff back to the workplace. Ms Fairbairn warned that commercial centres risk becoming permanent ""ghost towns"" and said that returning employees to offices is as important as getting pupils back to schools. In an interview on Times Radio, Mr Hancock was asked if he knew what percentage of staff in the Department for Health were working at home. ""I have absolutely no idea,"" he responded. ""What I care about is how effectively people work and obviously people should come back to the office if that is what they need to do their job. ""And also employers need to make sure the offices are Covid-secure, as we have obviously in the Department for Health, as you would fully expect us to."" He stressed: ""But what I care about is that people perform and so the people I work with, some of them have been working from home, some come in sometimes, some are full-time, and what matters to me is that they deliver and, frankly, they've been delivering at an unbelievable rate. ""I mean, you know, there's sometimes this caricature that people who work in the Civil Service work a 9 to 5 day, it's just completely untrue in my experience. ""And people are working incredibly hard because, ultimately, it's a mission-driven job and, in the middle of a pandemic, the whole department has stepped up to that mission."" The Health Secretary also said that getting staff back to work is a matter for employers. Mr Hancock said: ""I think that this has got to be done across the board. If you think about the nation as a whole, it's got to be done in a Covid-secure way. ""But employers are doing that and the rules are clear about that.""

307,Real,The Sun,"ONE year on ""business as usual"" can not continue between Britain and America until Harry Dunn's family get justice, a former Cabinet Minister warns today. On the anniversary of the teenage motorcyclist's death today, Andrea Leadsom tells The Sun: ""What has happened is quite simple yet utterly unacceptable."" Harry was riding his motorbike last summer when he collided with US citizen Anne Sacoolas who was driving on the wrong side of the road. Washington has refused to extradite the former CIA spy who fled in the aftermath of last year's fatal crash outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire. Sacoolas has been charged with dangerous driving - but claimed diplomatic immunity and absconded to the United States. Mrs Leadsom says today: ""The UK's greatest ally continues to deny justice to Harry - a 19 year old young man with all his life ahead of him."" Harry's mother Charlotte Charles said the decision not to send Sacoolas back to the UK  ""is doing us real harm and I can't believe how cruel the US government are being."" Today Ms Leadsom, who is the family's local MP, ramps up the pressure on the Attorney General to try Sacoolas virtually in the UK. She said: ""It is clear that Anne Sacoolas must face the responsibility of her actions – as anyone would expect to in these difficult circumstances. It will bring reassurance for Harry's family, friends and the local community. For closure and healing, justice must take place."" She added: ""Harry's family have never sought revenge, but they believe strongly in right and wrong, and in being accountable for your actions. ""They have agreed that  a 'virtual' trial, whereby Ms Sacoolas faces a UK jury whilst remaining on US soil, would give them the closure that they seek, and so with their agreement, I have written to Ministers and the CPS to ask for support for this clear way forward."" Robert Buckland the Justice Secretary confirmed this week that the Government is considering the plan. By Andrea Leadsom, South Northamptonshire MP TODAY marks one year since the terrible crash that caused the death of Harry Dunn outside RAF Croughton. We all know the tragic events of that day and the immense pain and loss that Harry's family and friends continue to live with. Harry's family should have received the justice they rightly deserve, but a year on, that is still not the case. As the local MP I have tried to support Harry's parents, Tim and Charlotte, and their family since they first came to seek my help last year. Together we have pressed the Foreign Secretary, Home Secretary, Transport Secretary, Health Secretary, Attorney General, Police and Crime Commissioner for Northamptonshire, Northamptonshire Police, the CPS and the US Embassy to deliver justice for Harry, as well as to make changes to diplomatic agreements and local improvements that will minimise the risk of a tragedy like this ever being repeated. I have made the case in the House of Commons that any idea of base expansion at RAF Croughton would be inappropriate while Harry's family continue to be denied justice by the US Government. I have asked for a recent planning application at the base to be called in under the Secretary of State's power to consider plans that have a 'national interest' angle. The refusal of the US Government to allow justice for Harry puts any 'business as usual' cooperation with planning at RAF Croughton firmly in this category. What has happened is quite simple yet utterly unacceptable - Anne Sacoolas claimed diplomatic immunity and returned to America. The Crown Prosecution Service charged her in her absence. Priti Patel, our Home Secretary, requested her extradition and the US Government refused. The Foreign Secretary recently fixed the 'anomaly' that allowed Sacoolas to claim diplomatic immunity, and this waiver is now expressly extended to all dependents of US staff at RAF Croughton.  It permits the automatic waiver of diplomatic immunity should another tragic incident occur in the future. So it's clear the US Government accept the principle that walking away from the consequences of your actions is wrong.  Yet the UK's greatest ally continues to deny justice to Harry - a 19 year old young man with all his life ahead of him. Harry's family have never sought revenge.  But they believe strongly in right and wrong, and in being accountable for your actions.  They have agreed that  a 'virtual' trial, whereby Ms Sacoolas faces a UK jury whilst remaining on US soil, would give them the closure that they seek, and so with their agreement, I have written to Ministers and the CPS to ask for support for this clear way forward. This approach would allow the US to continue to deny extradition and to refuse the waiver of diplomatic immunity.  If sentenced, Ms Sacoolas could carry out her term in the US. It is clear that Anne Sacoolas must face the responsibility of her actions – as anyone would expect to in these difficult circumstances. It will bring reassurance for Harry's family, friends and the local community. I will continue to push the Government for a virtual trial. For closure and healing, justice must take place.",Real Sun,861.0

The ancient body is being relaunched by ministers to drum up business for post Brexit-Britain and the PM is good friends with the former Aussie premier. Current Aussie PM Scott Morrison called it a ""good hire"" but back home there was uproar over Mr Abbott's right-wing track record. Asked about The Sun's report today that Mr Abbott is to head up the trade group, Mr Morrison said: ""well done Boris, good hire."" And under strict laws down under to counter espionage, he was asked if Mr Abbott would have to declare himself a foreign agent. ""If there's paperwork for Tony to fill out, I'm sure he'll get that done"", he told reporters. But Aussie Labor mocked the appointment as ""good for onion growers"" - in a reference to an astonishing 2015 incident where Mr Abbott ate a raw onion with the skin on like an apple. Their trade spokesman Madeleine King hit out: ""Is Tony Abbott, as a former prime minister, going to work for the UK government to promote the interests of British exporters over Australians? That's a question that needs to be answered."" And there was a row over why Mr Abbott was able to fly to London to meet with Trade Secretary Liz Truss to discuss the job yesterday despite Coronavirus flight restrictions Aussie Labor asked why the ex-PM was ""allowed to leave for a breakfast meeting about a plum job with a foreign government."" They added: ""With Scott Morrison it's clearly one rule for the privileged few while other Australians can't get exemptions to visit dying relatives."" In the UK, Shadow Trade Secretary Emily Thornberry branded it a ""staggering appointment"" due to Mr Abbott's controversies over the environment, women and immigration. She blasted: ""On a personal level, it is shameful that Boris Johnson thinks this offensive, aggressive, leering, gaffe-prone misogynist is the right person to represent our country overseas."" ""And on a professional level, this is someone with no hands-on experience of negotiating trade agreements, who denies the climate change that we believe should be at the heart of our trade policy, and who clearly has no concept of the importance of Britain's trade with the EU. She went on: ""He was ousted by his own colleagues after just two years in power, and rejected by his own constituents just last year.

Ministers are being urged to close the legal loophole that means 18 to 21-year-olds planning bombings can receive longer sentences than if attacks succeed. The bungled guidelines were introduced by Tony Blair's government in 2003. But they have been highlighted by the judge sentencing Manchester bombing accomplice Hashem Abedi.

312,Real,The Sun,"BORIS Johnson has issued a fresh plea for parents to send their kids back to school in September — warning that their ""life chances"" are under threat. But, returning to work after his abandoned Scottish camping trip, the PM faced demands from unions for more funding. As the Chief Medical Officer has said, the risk of contracting Covid-19 in school is very small and it is far more damaging for a child's development and their health and well-being to be away from school any longer. (3/4) Personally taking charge of the drive to reopen schools, he leapt on a statement made by the UK's chief medical officers that ""very few, if any"" kids would come to long-term harm from the virus by going to school, while there was a ""certainty"" of harm from not going back to class. In a video posted on Twitter, he said the risk of kids catching the virus is ""very, very, very small"" and the chances of them being very ill are even smaller still. The Prime Minister said: ""It's absolutely vital that pupils get back into school in September. ""It's vital for their education, it's vital for their welfare, it's vital for their physical, and indeed, their mental wellbeing. So let's make sure that all kids, all pupils, get back to school at the beginning of September."" He admitted parents are ""still a bit worried"" but that ""schools are safe"" as teachers have done all they can to make them secure. But Mr Johnson is now facing demands from Britain's biggest trade union for more money for cleaning and to allow teachers to wear masks before they agree to schools returning. Unison warned: ""No one wants to see schools shut down again after a few days because we haven't done enough to put necessary measures in place."" They want members to be allowed to wear masks in the classroom, claiming: ""It's still unclear why government guidance won't allow them when they're recommended for other workplaces."" Unison also wants more cash for school cleaning before they back a return, saying: ""Regular deep cleaning is also key."" Its head of education, Jon Richards, added: ""Schools need more money to pay for specially trained cleaners, rather than relying on other staff who are busy enough already."" A Public Health England report said only 0.01 per cent of pre-schools and primaries in England had a Covid-19 outbreak when pupils returned in June. WHAT must ordinary teachers think about the cynical wrecking actions of their union leaders? Dedicated classroom staff know the UK's chief medical officers are dead right to say kids are more at risk of long-term harm from staying at home than from returning to school. They appreciate more than most how youngsters have been damaged by more than five months without learning, and that the most disadvantaged kids have suffered disproportionately. Their chief concern will be for the education of their pupils. Of course they want to be safe, and they want the children to be safe, but they don't want to wait for impossible guarantees before returning to classrooms where the risk of infection is ""exceptionally small"". That can't be said of the union militants who see the Covid crisis as the perfect excuse to hold the Government to ransom. For them, pupils are just useful political pawns. The latest obstacles to learning come from Unison demanding more money for cleaning and masks for teachers before it will agree to the return to school. Wouldn't they — and flip-flopping Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer — enjoy the Government's discomfort if they turn the start of the new term into another education fiasco? And if children's futures are blighted in the process, so what? That's a risk the militants seem only too happy to take. Reopening was associated with 198 confirmed Covid-19 cases — 70 in kids and 128 in staff. Mr Johnson said on Sunday night: ""As the chief medical officer has said, the risk of contracting Covid-19 in school is very small and it is far more damaging for a child's development to be away any longer.

The latest YouGov Eurotrack+US survey shows China's behaviour has ""cemented an idea in the minds of people in the West that the country has been ravaged by the disease.""

314,Real,The Sun,"EMERGENCY plans have been drawn up to protect the UK from the perfect storm of a winter second wave of Covid-19 coinciding with a No Deal Brexit, a leaked document shows. The warnings, including needing the Navy to protect our fishing fleet from illegal EU boat incursions, pile pressure on ministers to do a deal with Brussels as well as ready the system for a virus spike. The Cabinet Office's EU Transition Task Force gave ministers and officials a horror show Powerpoint presentation marked ""Official Sensitive"" amid concerns not enough is being done to prepare for the worst-case scenario. The leak comes as the latest round of EU trade talks ended with warnings the negotiations are ""going backwards"" and the chances of No Deal in December is rising. If the restrictions on trade sparked by a No Deal scenario were combined with a bad winter of flood, flu and Covid-19, hospitals could be overwhelmed. And parts of Britain may be hit by shortages of power and petrol as 8,500 trucks get stuck at Dover. In Whitehall's ""reasonable worst case scenario"" animal disease might rip through the countryside due to shortages of medicines and the Channel Islands could need military airdrops to avoid running out of food. It warns the Navy might be needed to stop vigilante British fisherman clashing with hundreds of illegal European fishing boat incursions. The Sun has seen the doomsday classified document designed to kickstart ministers into a major planning operation to see off disaster. It reveals: Downing Street is pushing hard for a trade deal but is making  contingency plans for an ""unruly"" exit from the EU transition period at the end of December. With trade talks looking set to go the wire, there is a risk they collapse — putting up trade barriers overnight on 1 January. In that scenario planners believe France will force ""mandatory controls on UK goods from day one"" and between 40 and 70 per cent of hauliers travelling across the Channel may not be ready for this. That could see flow between Dover and Calais down 45 per cent for three months, triggering long queues of HGVs in Kent. It could lead to shortages of the 30 per cent of our food imported from the EU as well as medicines, chemicals for drinking water purification and fuel supply. This could trigger water rationing and even power cuts. Food supply across the country would be hit by panic buying at Christmas, the busiest time of year. There are also increasing fears in Whitehall that Covid-19 will return with a vengeance in the winter months. The planners warned that ""pandemic influenza, severe flooding, a Covid second wave and an unruly exit from the EU transition period could cause a systemic economic crisis with major impact on disposable incomes, unemployment, business activity, international trade and market stability."" It could be combined with likely ""coordinated industrial action"" as well as shortages risking public disorder and a mental health crisis that will hit the poorest hardest. Rising virus infections and hospital admissions would require a possible return to two-metre social distancing rules and further lockdown restrictions ""well into 2021"". But, they fear, public compliance with anti-Covid measures could ""steadily wane"". And ministers have been warned the NHS could be overwhelmed by a ""one in 40-year flu scenario alongside even a continuation of the current levels of C19 and significantly overwhelmed in any level of second peak"". The document says five per cent of councils in England ""are already at high risk of financial failure following Covid-19"". It means some town halls may go bust and need bailing out or may need to be under direct control of Whitehall. And inflation could ""significantly impact social care providers due to increasing staff and supply costs"". Ministers have also been told to brace for a further 24 months of virus infections in care homes. There are fears of public disorder as a result of shortages and a major economic slump. The outlook is also bleak for Gibraltar and the Channel Islands, both reliant on imports. Gibraltar could be cut off from Spain and economically crippled and the Channel Islands may need airdrops of medicines and food. Three quarters of UK medicine imports come through Dover, and many have a limited shelf life — making stockpiling difficult. During the pandemic the focus on Covid has led to a slump in animal vaccine production. If the borders are jammed stockpiles could deplete, risking disease among livestock. When confronted by our leaked document the Cabinet Office outlined contingency plans to avoid the chaos: It includes extensive winter planning including an extra £3billion for the NHS and an extra £600million for social care. Covid-19 testing capacity will be extended to 300,000 a day and billions of items of PPE delivered to health and social care workers. A further £775million will be spent on new border and customs infrastructure and new border rules phased in over six months to try to avoid backlogs. There will also be an advertising blitz to get businesses ready for changes and encourage them to prepare supply chains and stockpiling of critical medicines. Data and finance rules will be relaxed to keep firms trading with the EU in the event of No Deal.",Real Sun,875.0

Bodyguards said it wasn't safe for the family to stay on and it is understood they flew home on Thursday after just three days.

The only thing that would have made it even more hellish was if we'd taken along a squawking baby. Which is why I admire Carrie Symonds for tucking son Wilfred under her arm, taking Boris by the hand and setting off for a camping holiday by the coast. I've had some of the best holidays of my life in Scotland, especially Orkney, the Outer Hebrides and the Highlands, but never in a tent and not with a child that is a long way from being potty trained. Carrie is obviously very patient and understanding, and if she can survive that with a baby and an overgrown toddler, she deserves a medal. As for Boris, he got straight back to work after fighting coronavirus and took no paternity leave — only to have his getaway ended after three days. Give the man a break. Westminster was awash with claims his location was leaked by his Scottish nationalist adversaries. A senior Tory told The Sun: ""The finger of blame for this all getting out is being pointed at the SNP, particularly Ian Blackford who is local."" Mr Blackford hit back saying: ""This is completely preposterous and at no point have I referred publicly to the PM's whereabouts. It's nothing to do with me and to be smeared in this way is unacceptable.""",Real Sun,636.0
316,Real,The Sun,"THE row over Gavin Williamson's future exploded into Tory civil war today after the outspoken new boss of the Scottish Conservatives suggested he should quit after the exams fiasco. Douglas Ross plunged the Government into a cross-border war of words after urging the embattled Education Secretary to ""reflect on what happened"" and refused to back him staying in his job. Mr Ross took the reins of the party north of the border after spectacularly resigning himself from a junior ministerial role in protest over the Dominic Cummings lockdown saga in May. The part-time elite linesman and MP for Moray told an interview on Thursday morning: ""I'm not here to say in your report that I think Gavin Williamson has done a great job and he should continue. ""I think he has to reflect on what happened to so many pupils in England, students who were concerned for four days, because we had the exact same up here in Scotland for a week."" His comments came after Mr Williamson apologised to thousands of pupils and parents across England after abandoning a computer marking system that plunged A-Level results in chaos. A week before, Mr Ross had demanded that Scotland's Education Secretary John Swinney resign after a similar blunder, that was quickly u-turned over in Holyrood. Mr Ross told Radio Scotland: ""I think Gavin Williamson and the government and the Department for Education will be reflecting on why did they not see the problem that the SNP had to deal with as a result of their actions in Scotland."" Downing Street did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Today Mr Ross told the Scottish Sun he's not doomed to be another SNP election scalp like Jo Swinson or Jim Murphy. But he risked antagonising No10 with lukewarm remarks about Boris Johnson. And when asked if he ""admired"" the PM, the Scots Tory leader replied: ""I admire any prime minister or leader of any country."" As the Sun reported yesterday, senior Cabinet colleagues believe Mr Williamson is ""on his last life"" after the exams fiasco and will be swiftly sacked if schools reopening is botched. No10 does not dispute Williamson offered to resign but Mr Williamson is under huge pressure not to botch getting kids back to their desks next month.",Real Sun,380.0
317,Real,The Sun,"A SUDANESE criminal has been jailed for two years after trying to smuggle NINE migrants across the channel in a tiny boat. Altaib Mobarak, 43, was detained by a Border Force cutter on 7 July with two children and seven other adults in a dingy. He had previously been spotted trying to avoid the French coastguard to reach British waters in the inflatable boat. On Tuesday he was sent down at Canterbury Crown Court after admitting a charge of facilitating illegal entry into the UK at an earlier hearing. All 10 people on board  – Sudanese and Yemeni nationals - were transferred to the cutter and brought to Dover where they were passed to immigration officials. Mobarak was arrested and later confessed to being at the helm. The Home Office's new Clandestine Channel Threat Commander Dan O'Mahoney said: ""People should seek asylum in the first safe country they enter. ""Those attempting to cross the Channel, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, in unsuitable boats and without appropriate maritime skills are putting at risk the lives of all those on board. ""It is of particular concern when, as was the case here, vulnerable children are involved. He added: ""It is precisely because of this risk to life – a reality that we have seen confirmed in yesterday's tragic incident – that we are determined to put a stop to these dangerous crossings."" Mr O'Mahoney, who was appointed last month, is in France today urging the Paris authorities to take tougher action in France to stop the crossings. The crisis on the Channel hit a new low after a 16-year-old migrant boy was found dead on a French beach was desperately trying to reach the UK before the arrival of Storm Ellen. The Sudanese youngster, along with a companion, had got into difficulty in the sea in the early hours of Wednesday morning and was discovered at Sangatte, near Calais. The unnamed youth set off from the Descenderie de Sangatte beach with a friend in a 'small makeshift inflatable craft' soon after midnight on Wednesday morning. They got into difficulties straightaway, with the boat capsizing, and both Sudanese nationals being swept overboard. The companion, suffering from hypothermia, reported that the boy may still be in the water and could not swim after a fisherman working on the shoreline saw the boat capsize and immediately called emergency services. Philippe Sabatier, deputy prosecutor, confirmed that a criminal enquiry had been opened into the 16-year-old's death. He said: ""One young man was rescued in the sea soon afterwards, and he reported his friend missing, it is thus very likely that this missing person corresponds to the body found."" He added that a makeshift boat was later found on the beach, along with a mobile phone, documents and 'a shovel that would have been used as an oar'.",Real Sun,473.0
318,Real,The Sun,"MILITANT teachers are threatening to shut schools if local coronavirus cases hit 50 in 100,000. But the latest union attempt to halt a return to the classroom was branded a ""hard-left wrecking ball to our children's futures"". The demand would currently see pupils not back at desks in cities and towns including Bradford, Blackburn and Oldham, with Swindon and Rochdale also nudging the cut-off point. The Education Solidarity Network, a left-wing faction in the National Education Union, will hold street protests on Friday across Britain with a list of safety demands such as free PPE and weekly Covid tests for teachers. And it announced tonight it wants to be able to close classrooms if local infection rates hit its chosen level. ESN boss and secondary school teacher James Kerr said: ""We have already lost colleagues to the virus and will lose more if there is not action."" He added: ""It's not the Victorian era anymore. Every worker should be able to go to work in the knowledge that they will return alive and well."" More moderate bosses of the biggest teachers unions distanced themselves from the ESN's cut-off figure. But they warned: ""We have to prepare for a range of possible scenarios — including pupils and teachers having to isolate."" The NEU's spokesman added: ""We are pressing the Government on the need to have a robust track, trace and test programme in place and a Plan B in the case of local lockdowns or a second spike."" PM Boris Johnson has said schools will be the last thing to close even in areas experiencing a resurgence of the virus. And today a key ally rejected the latest plot by organised teachers and urged Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to do the same. Conservative Party co-chairman Amanda Milling hit out: ""This hard-left action takes a wrecking ball to our children's futures. ""Sir Keir Starmer and the NEU need to take a stand and put a stop to this action that puts the future of so many young people at risk. ""Getting children back to school is a key priority and we should all be working together to get pupils back safely. ""We have a detailed plan and it's time for Labour and the NEU to work with us to ensure the life chances of a generation of schoolchildren — particularly the most disadvantaged — are not lost to coronavirus."" But a Labour source warned that schools reopening risked being a ""fiasco"" like exam results due to blundering ministers. The row came as senior Tories warned Gavin Williamson is ""on his last life"" and will be swiftly sacked if the reopening of schools is botched. The embattled Education Secretary has defied calls to quit from opposition parties following the A-levels grading scandal. But No10 does not dispute Mr Williamson offered to fall on his sword. Fellow Cabinet ministers and MPs have told The Sun he would not survive another scandal next month if he botches Mr Johnson's flagship pledge to reopen schools. Senior Tories reject claims Boris is protecting the ex-Chief Whip who helped organise the PM's party takeover — amid fears he ""not only buried all the bodies but still has the shovel"". One Government insider said: ""Gavin talks a good game but the People's Government will not be blackmailed by anyone."" The warnings came as Health Secretary Matt Hancock hinted Mr Williamson had not been given the boot because of his crucial role in implementing the PM's promise to parents that pupils will be back at the start of the new term. Mr Hancock told Sky News: ""The big focus is on getting schools back and open at the start of next month, an incredibly important task. ""I don't think we should be distracted from that task now.

On Tuesday night a government source insisted that no decision had yet been made. However ex-Cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith urged the Government to lobby the International Olympic Committee to change the venue. He said: ""China is dictatorial, aggressive and intolerant.

320,Real,The Sun,"FEARS are growing that Swindon could be the next town to be hit with lockdown — as it has the highest covid rates in the south of England. Ministers are worried after 43 people tested positive in the Wiltshire town last week. And they fear the surge in cases will require North West style special measures. Public Health England's latest data has Swindon as the 5th highest infection rate with 48.2 cases per 100,000 and list the area as one of concern. That is the highest in the south of England however the local council insist that the outbreak is under control, and that enforcement of lockdown measures would be a ""last resort"". But a Health department source said the town was in ""the danger zone."" Health workers are patrolling with information and the mobile testing units have been set up. A council spokesman said: ""Public health colleagues are doing a fantastic job in responding to multiple small outbreaks across the town in an effort to break the chain of infection and keep all Swindon residents safe."" At the weekend Swindon South MP Robert Buckland said the council was ""working tirelessly"" to help prevent a community-based outbreak. The concerns came as Leicester was finally freed from lockdown measures slapped on in June. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock said coronavirus cases remain too high to ease all the restrictions in the city. Nail bars, beauty salons and tanning booths can reopen from Wednesday, while guidance telling outdoor music venues and theatres to stay closed will be dropped. But residents in the lockdown area will not be able to meet inside a private home or garden of someone they have not formed a ""support bubble"" with. The easing will bring the city into line with the easing of restrictions introduced for much of the nation on July 11 and 13. Mr Hancock said: ""My gratitude goes out to the people of Leicester who have all made sacrifices to keep the virus at bay and protect their local communities. ""The rate of infection has now dropped to a safe enough level to allow further businesses including beauty salons, nail bars and some outdoor venues to reopen in the area. ""Current restrictions on gatherings must remain in place to further bring down the rate of infection."" Spas, massage and tattoo parlours, and body and skin piercing services will also be able to reopen on Wednesday morning. But the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said infection rates are still too high for a full easing, so restrictions on gatherings will continue in line with Greater Manchester and parts of West Yorkshire and east Lancashire. Shielding for the most vulnerable will continue but with easing in Leicester to allow individuals to meet in a group of up to six people outdoors while maintaining social distancing.",Real Sun,471.0
321,Real,The Sun,"AS he staycations in his tent in Scotland this week, no one could blame the Prime Minister for being reflective about the past year's ups and downs. From being written off in the backbench wilderness, to king of the Tory party. From an almighty rollicking from our most senior judges, to Brexit champion. From the most successful election winner in a generation, to captain of the ship when it hit the terrifying rocks of the pandemic. Throw into that his own brush with death from the virus — and the joy of a new baby son — for good measure. It has been on one hell of a ride. But Boris Johnson needs to put all that behind him and get ready for four months that could make that rollercoaster look like a bouncy castle. Enjoy your holiday, Prime Minister, because winter is coming. As Westminster goes ""back to school"" in September, the Downing Street in-tray is heaving with mammoth tasks. Any one, in normal times, would test the most brilliant of administrations. But as the PM and his closest Cabinet colleagues admit privately, the corona crisis has revealed that the machine of Government is not in great nick. Colourful metaphors float around Whitehall: Ministers pulling levers to find they are made of chocolate; No10 pedalling on a bike that doesn't have a chain. But letting rows about reform and an internal rewiring of the system dominate will be met with short shrift by a public willing to forgive early mistakes in the crisis but who will likely be very unimpressed if the chaos continues. The first key to unlocking Britain's recovery is to get the schools back in September. We have heard good, solid words that the kids will be back at their desks by hook or by crook. But the past week of damaging A-level chaos and a potential week ahead of GCSE uproar does not exactly scream that all is well in the Department for Education. Gavin Williamson — or Frank Spencer, as he is now nicknamed in Cabinet circles — might be an easy target. But the buck stops with No10. And if anyone can talk ""vision"", it is Boris. So perhaps we need to hear a bit more from him. As furlough winds down and unemployment creeps higher, November's Budget is the next red light on the dashboard. At his first Budget in March, Rishi Sunak set aside a whopping £30billion for the emergency measures. The near-£350billion he will have spent this year makes that a comedic drop in the ocean. And now the golden boy of the Government has to work out how to pay for it all. Tory MPs will be hoping the Chancellor will return to those Thatcherite instincts he boasted about. But there will be massive pressure from the Treasury establishment for him to turn to ""revenue raisers"" — higher taxes to you and me. Yet Mr Sunak should be very careful here. Tax hikes on already strained incomes represent the quickest and easiest way to turn this recession into another Great Depression. Duty increases on booze are the last thing the struggling hospitality industry needs. Let's not clobber motorists who simply want to return to work, either. If the Treasury insists, a rise in capital-gains tax on second-home sales would be fairer. And Rishi and Boris should seek another way to solve our economic doldrums: Brexit, the PM's other huge in-tray issue. The New Year deadline for a Brussels trade deal is right when ministers fear there could be a second Covid wave. But Mr Johnson rightly says he is not going to be bounced into a deal and the chances of No Deal are growing. We have already seen economic disruption on a scale far worse than anything predicted by Remainers. The scaremongering will not work this time, with a battle-hardened public. Bouncing back Any deal must not stop Britain becoming a more tempting investment opportunity than the Continent, allowing ministers to harness our new-found freedom to fix the Covid mess. There are growing whispers that the EU's demand of so-called ""level playing-field rules"" — in reality, continued red tape and Britain bound to Brussels law for ever — could be too much to overcome. Hopes of a deal could be shelved and instead issues such as security cooperation and financial service agreements would have to be forged separately, possibly with the more pragmatic EU states. How years more of smaller side negotiations tallies with Mr Johnson's claims to have ""got Brexit done"" is a tricky one. But it's better than being bounced into a deal that will stop Britain bouncing back.",Real Sun,773.0

A further easing of lockdown rules will also see snooker lovers back in the Crucible this weekend for the World Championship. Rugby matches and racing at Goodwood are also on the list of approved ""pilot"" events in the coming weeks. But capacity will be capped and all fans will likely be urged not to chant or shout for fear of spreading the virus. The new Premier League season starts on September 12. Trials of allowing some fans back in stadiums will be tested later that month ahead of a planned full rollout in October. Spectators will be made to sign up to a new code of behaviour. It will make them take full responsibility for themselves and others by not attending if they have Covid symptoms or have been exposed to anyone with them. And strict crowd management plans will be enforced with one-way entry and exit and staggered arrival times. Seating will be socially distanced and hand washing and sanitiser stations set up. But no trials are scheduled for the North West, which remains under stricter control. Tonight Boris Johnson said: ""At every stage I have said our plan to reopen society and the economy is conditional. ""Today we are able to announce some further changes which will allow more people to return to work and the public to get back to more of the things they have missed. GET in there! The return of football since mid-June has been an absolute joy, with no shortage of excitement on the pitch, but something has definitely been missing. That something is the crowd. Supporters are the lifeblood of the game so it's great news that stadiums could see a return of fans for the new season, albeit at a quarter of capacity. It's just a shame they might not be allowed to sing, whether they're winning or not.

323,Real,The Sun,"FINES for not wearing masks are to be hiked to up to £3,200. The move comes amid fears that young people could fuel a second wave of coronavirus in Britain. Organisers of illegal lockdown raves will also be slapped with £10,000 fines. Ministers are worried that young people — who are rarely affected by the virus — are flouting social distancing and mask wearing rules. As a result, they risk spreading Covid-19 to elderly relatives, with deadly consequences. People face a £100 fine for not wearing a mask. Repeat offenders will now see fines double each time — all the way up to a maximum of £3,200. It is compulsory to wear face coverings on public transport, in shops and when collecting takeaway food. Last month Met Police boss Dame Cressida Dick said she would prefer for shoppers to be ""shamed"" into wearing masks rather than officers have to enforce the rules. But concern among ministers and medics that too many were ignoring this tactic, led Boris Johnson to last night order a clampdown. Illegal raves that have seen thousands of young people across Britain flout social distancing measures are also his ministers sights. Known as ""forest parties"", they are promoted on social media and have sprung up across the country. The Met says more than 530 illegal raves were held in July in the capital, with police across the country also battling all night gatherings.

The Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime (Mopac) announced on Thursday it would not be acting on a complaint about the Commissioner's decision there was not enough evidence to launch a probe. The Mirror first revealed that 40- 50 staff gathered ""cheek by jowl"" for the festive event with drinks, nibbles and party games including a festive quiz and Secret Santa on December 18 last year. At the time, London was in Tier 3 measures which banned all indoor socialising between two or more households to help drive down soaring Covid rates. Subsequently, details of emails and messages between No 10 staff about the party have emerged, as well as a bombshell video showing aides laughing about the event just days later. But Scotland Yard has said it will not investigate the alleged breaches of Covid laws ""at this point"". Green Party peer Baroness Jones initially wrote to the force to complain about the gathering, with the Met replying to confirm it had been split into two parts, one to be considered by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) and the second to Mopac. The IOPC announced on Wednesday that it would not be probing the first part, focusing on whether Met officers manning the gate at Downing Street did their job properly that night. The party took place inside No 10, where there is no police presence, while most of those taking part worked in the building so may not have attracted the attention of officers. The watchdog said that having looked at the referral it had ""decided it is invalid"" because the complainant, Baroness Jones, was not directly affected by the police's actions that night. Mopac confirmed on Thursday it would not be referring the second part of the complaint, about Dame Cressida's failure to investigate, to the IOPC for the same reason. A spokesman for Mopac said: ""As the appropriate authority responsible for considering complaints against the Commissioner we can confirm a complaint was received on Friday 17 December. ""This concerned the Commissioner's action in respect of an investigation into an alleged party at 10 Downing Street in December 2020. ""Following a thorough assessment and review, no further action will be taken in respect of this complaint as the complainant was not directly affected by the alleged conduct or its effects as is required under the Police Reform Act 2002.""

326,Real,The Mirror,"The Prime Minister delayed an announcement today as ministers want more data despite scientists warnings about the Omicron threat Boris Johnson is not expected to impose more Covid curbs before Christmas after delaying a crunch decision on Monday amid Cabinet opposition. Yet the Prime Minister remains under intense pressure to reveal how the Government will curb spiralling Omicron infections before the festive break. Whitehall insiders suggested the PM was considering a 'circuit breaker' lockdown - but it would not come in until after Christmas. Sources said the PM was deliberating plunging England back into step two restrictions for between two weeks and one month from December 27.  But the Government would need to give MPs, who Mr Johnson has promised would get a vote, time to get back to Westminster - so it could be the following day. However, one Whitehall source stressed that the plan was ""not decided yet"" and the PM could yet be swayed by scientists or his own Tory backbenchers. The PM met his Cabinet for an emergency Covid briefing from his chief scientific advisers on Monday. But he and some of his top ministers are said to not yet believe the data is firm enough to justify signing off any new restrictions. The Government could, however, announce informal guidance ahead of Christmas advising households not to mix. Once source admitted that guidelines, rather than formal restrictions, were ""entirely possible"" in the coming days. But scientists have called for new restrictions to be brought in as soon as possible to prevent the health service being overwhelmed. The SAGE committee of advisors has cautioned that hospitalisations could peak at between 3,000 and 10,000 a day unless urgent action is taken. Under the plans on the table, households would be banned from mixing socially indoors and outdoor gatherings limited to the rule of six or two households. Bars, pubs and restaurants would be closed indoors and restricted to table service for those serving alcohol. Foreign holidays would be banned although travel abroad for legally permitted reasons would still be allowed. Mr Johnson is in a precarious position with Tory MPs after almost 100 rebelled over new Covid measures last week. Senior Tory MP Mark Harper, who chairs the Covid recovery group, said: ""Not telling the public what's going on is unacceptable. ""These are big decisions affecting everyone's lives, people's livelihoods and mental wellbeing across the country. ""We all deserve to see the data ministers see. Show us your workings. We can do so much better than this."" Confirmed cases of the faster-spreading strain have risen by more than 12,000 in the UK, with London's cases alone topping 10,000, according to the latest data. Health chiefs have warned that some hospitals are on the brink of collapse with mass absences among staff due to the Omicron strain. Deputy PM Dominic Raab said on Monday he could not make any ""hard, fast guarantees"" that more restrictions will not be needed ahead of Christmas Day. Mr Raab said the data is ""always under review"" but claimed the country is in a ""better position"" to enjoy the festive season with family as a result of the vaccine.

The Mirror understands Boris Johnson is set to have urgent meetings tomorrow with scientists and his top team. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned there are ""no guarantees"" Christmas gatherings will be able to go ahead. It comes days after Mr Johnson assured the public the Government will not ""cancel"" Christmas. Measures on the table include a ban on households mixing and the closure of indoor hospitality venues and non-essential shops within days. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has failed to rule out a circuit breaker lockdown in England before Christmas to cut pressure on the NHS. Fears the Government will ""cancel"" Christmas come as official figures show there were another 82,866 cases of Covid today, up more than 50% in the past week. Covid cases topped 80,000 for only the fourth time since the start of pandemic with the new Omicron variant up 50% in just 24 hours. The Government's scientific advisers said it was ""almost certain"" there were hundreds of thousands of new Omicron infections each day. Mr Javid warned there were ""no guarantees"" that Christmas gatherings would be able to go ahead as planned. The Government's SAGE committee of advisers has cautioned that hospitalisations could surge to between 3,000 and 10,000 a day unless urgent action is taken. The Health Secretary admitted that ""everything is under review"" after the grim assessment suggested that infections could reach two million by the end of the month. The Mirror has been told Boris Johnson has cleared his diary for tomorrow for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team. No10 said that the PM was in touch with his advisers and keeping abreast of the data, while the four nations of the UK met for a Cobra meeting on the situation. But - with just five days before families are due to gather for Christmas – a source said there was no plans for a press conference tomorrow announcing any changes to restrictions. Mr Javid, 52, admitted that scientific advice warning of a possible a surge in hospital admissions from Omicron was worrying - and that he would be cutting down on hugs with his elderly mum. He suggested the Government could not rule out any new measures before Christmas, adding: ""There are no guarantees in this pandemic. ""At this point we just have to keep everything under review."" Earlier, when asked to rule out tougher rules in the coming days, he said: ""We are assessing the situation, it's very fast-moving. ""We've seen with Omicron there's a lot that we still don't know about Omicron. That's the truth of the matter. The reality is there's a lot of uncertainty."" But he admitted that it was ""time to be more cautious"" and the Government would do ""what is necessary"" to keep the public safe. The PM is believed to prefer the prospect of delaying restrictions until after Christmas - even though that could be too late for the NHS. Mr Javid's remarks will cause yet more outrage among Conservative backbenchers after almost 100 voted to block much milder restrictions last week. The PM - who has repeatedly insisted that Christmas will go ahead - is likely to face another huge Tory rebellion to push any changes through. The Government has said MPs would be asked to return to Parliament to vote if new restrictions are needed. One Tory rebel, senior MP Tobias Ellwood, said the Government had to improve its handling of the pandemic. ""It's on the bus, off the bus. The economy stops then starts again. We can't continue doing that,"" he said. The speculation over new restrictions comes after experts warned there are likely already hundreds of thousands of new infections from Omicron every day. If even a small number of them ended up in hospital it could risk overwhelming the NHS. Of the 82,866 cases of Covid today these included 12,133 cases of Omicron, up from 10,059 the day before, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Deaths in England of people with the variant rose to 12, up from seven, while hospital admissions increased to 104, up from 85. Prof Stephen Reicher, a member of SAGE, said it was clear that Plan B measures alone would not stop the spiralling numbers of cases.

329,Real,The Mirror,"Mr Johnson has had a torrid week in which he suffered a massive backbench rebellion, lost the North Shropshire by-election and Brexit minister Lord Frost quit Cabinet. More than half of Tory voters at the last election think Boris Johnson is dishonest in the wake of the 'Partygate' scandal, new bombshell polling reveals. The finding represents a huge 8% jump in mistrust in the Prime Minister in the last month following numerous Christmas party scandals revealed by the Daily Mirror. Just a third of 2019 Tory voters now believe that Mr Johnson is honest after weeks of the Government being rocked by the rows over Covid rule-breaking last year. The Survation poll, for campaign group 38 degrees, also found that more Tory voters now say the PM does not uphold the 'Nolan principles' - selflessness, integrity, accountability, openness and honesty - than say he does. Two thirds of all voters (68%) believe the PM is dishonest while 63% think he lacks integrity - and he is viewed more negatively than the Conservative Party itself. Mr Johnson has had a torrid week in which he suffered a massive backbench rebellion, lost the North Shropshire by-election and Brexit minister Lord Frost quit Cabinet. Ellie Gellard, campaigns director at 36 Degrees, said: ""Voters want honesty from the country's leaders - it's a basic sign of respect. Now the public's verdict is in. In the wake of the Downing Street Christmas party scandals, the majority of Boris Johnson's own voters now think he's lying. ""Whether it's ignoring the rules they've set, or trying to rewrite them, this Government is haemorrhaging public trust."" The PM still faces ongoing questions over his own role in the Christmas parties row with him personally accused of taking part in at least one - plus a leaving do in November. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, who oversees the Metropolitan Police, said it did appear that Mr Johnson had broken the law by hosting the No 10 festive quiz. Mr Khan told the BBC : ""From what I've seen, I've looked at the evidence, it does appear that way."" He stressed that it was an operational decision for the Metropolitan Police to decide whether they investigated. But he added: ""If rule makers are seen to be rule breakers it's hardly surprising when people don't follow additional announcements made by the Government"". Health Secretary Sajid Javid admitted that he understood why people might question why they should follow coronavirus rules if it appears members of the Government had not. He told Sky News: ""I absolutely understand where those kinds of questions might come from. ""That is why I think it is really, really important that we maintain public confidence by having that investigation that is now taking place."" He said that top civil servant Sue Gray, who will lead the probe into parties across Whitehall last year, was known for her ""neutrality and probity"". Mr Javid said she would be able to ""go wherever she wants"" and could even investigate her own boss Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, who stood aside after it emerged that a party took place in his own office. ""She has the freedom as I understand to go wherever she wants with this investigation,"" he said.  ""That's the way it should be because people want to know the facts and that this is the best way to establish them."" But whether people were less likely to follow the Covid rules as a result of the breaches, he said: ""If we do have to take further measures as the situation develops, then I believe the British people will respond in the same way they have throughout this pandemic"".  More than 84,000 members of the public have also signed a 38 Degrees open letter calling for the PM to ""come clean"" about the parties and pay a fine. Catriona, a Tory voter in Norwich North, told the campaign group: ""I no longer trust the Conservative party and have only ever voted for them. ""I feel like they are corrupt… I don't think the Government have given us anything to trust them on, bar vaccines."" Alan, who voted for the Tories in Don Valley at the last election, said: ""I have always supported Boris but this complete disregard for what most people were experiencing together with his total lack of taking responsibility for what happened has made me feel a complete lack of confidence in his judgement. ""We should be able to expect our Prime Minister to be honest and to take responsibility rather than lay blame on others.""  Susan, a life-long Tory voter from Moray, Scotland, added: ""I am 72 years old and have voted for the Conservatives all my life. ""Unfortunately the behaviour... has destroyed my faith in their ability to continue to lead this country out of the brutalised economy caused by Covid.

Boris Johnson has been saying for weeks that he's ""absolutely confident"" this festive season will be better than last year's. Just days ago, the Prime Minister even told us the Government wasn't cancelling our Christmas get-togethers. But apocalyptic warnings of what could happen to our hospitals if even a small proportion of people with Omicron end up there is forcing a rethink. Health Secretary Sajid Javid admits there are ""no guarantees"" that there won't be any more restrictions before Christmas. While all eyes are on next week's hospitalisation figures, he admits: ""If you wait until data is absolutely perfect it may well be too late."" But if that data suggests that Christmas plans need to be curtailed again, many will be justifiably angry that the PM ever let us believe they could go ahead as normal. While Omicron only arrived in the UK at the end of last month, if last Christmas taught us anything it was not to over-promise when new variants could emerge at any point. The PM is now risks losing any public goodwill he may have left - and is between a rock and a hard place of his own making. Either he listens to the scientists and brings in last-minute restrictions now, potentially 'saving' the NHS but infuriating already febrile Tory MPs. Or he 'saves' Christmas, only to toughen up the rules days later when it may already be too late to prevent hospitals collapsing under the strain. Ever the populist, Johnson's political instinct will be to put off the hard decision for as long as possible. He could, quite feasibly, duck leadership altogether and tell people to make up their own minds over their Christmas plans. But with public trust in the PM already rock bottom after revelations of rule-breaking last year, he's taking a big gamble on the public being willing to listen.",Real Mirror,345.0
331,Real,The Mirror,"The Foreign Secretary's new brief is set to fuel mounting speculation of her leadership ambitions. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has taken over the Brexit brief after Lord Frost dramatically quit the Cabinet. Downing Street announced the top Tory - a potential leadership rival to Boris Johnson - would take over ""with immediate effect"". Her first task will be to iron out the final details of the future relationship amid stalled negotiations with the European Union. The Prime Minister will hope that Ms Truss's appointment will help to placate the mutinous ranks of Tory backbenchers. Lord Frost - who negotiated Britain's departure from the EU - reportedly resigned over the ""political direction"" of Mr Johnson's government. Ms Truss backed Remain but since the referendum she has pinned her political ambitions on becoming an ardent Brexit supporter. She regularly polls as the most popular senior Tory among party members and could be a threat to the PM in his precarious position with his own MPs. But Mr Johnson has put her in charge of one of thethorniest of issues which could leave her struggling to keep both Tory Brexiteers and the EU happy. Brexiteer Chris Heaton-Harris will become Minister of State at the Foreign Office and will deputise for Ms Truss on the Brexit brief. In his resignation letter Lord Frost, a hardline Brexiteer who was regarded in European capitals as a block on progress, spoke of his desire to see a ""low-tax"" economy. But insiders suggested that the PM's willingness to compromise with Brussels to finally get his Brexit deal over the line was the final straw. It comes just days after Britain formally dropped its demand that Europe's highest court should have no legal role in the controversial Northern Ireland protocol. Lord Frost's departure was described as a ""devastating blow"" for Mr Johnson by prominent Tory Brexiteer Andrew Bridgen. Tory MP Peter Bone added: ""That rebellion of 100 Conservative MPs was partly due to the fact that we want to see the PM move to a more Conservative agenda in future.""",Real Mirror,341.0

The Prime Minister allegedly told one attendee that they deserved a drink for ""beating back"" the virus - even though 314 people had died that day. At the time, the public was banned from mixing outdoors with more than one person from a different household, while indoor gatherings were strictly forbidden. A report in the Guardian and the Independent claimed the social event event took place after a press conference with then health secretary Matt Hancock.  Sources told the papers that the PM and Mr Hancock were present for a short time while aides were drinking, but neither drank themselves or stayed late.

Hannah Brady, spokesperson for Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, said: ""I remember 15 May 2020 very well. That's because while Boris Johnson was at this party I was sitting in a hospital with my dad dying in intensive care. We had to fight to see Dad and sat there for 5 hours with him.

But what should be a comfortable win for the Tories - ex-MP Owen Paterson had a majority of almost 23,000 - is now looking precarious.

""The Chairman has written to him in his capacity as a local MP and invited him to visit the Trust. A response to the invitation was awaited."" Mr Javid's apparent failure to reply comes despite the local trust warning that record handover delays at the region's hospitals are putting patients at risk of severe harm or even death. The trust recently apologised to one 95-year old woman who was left waiting for 11 hours on the floor of her home with a suspected broken leg for an ambulance to turn up.

The Prime Minister was pictured on screen, sitting underneath a portrait of Margaret Thatcher as he read out questions. A source said many staff huddled by computers, conferring on questions and knocking back fizz, wine and beer from a local Tesco Metro. In one office, the insider said, there were four teams, each made up of six people. It was December 15 – three days before a gathering now being probed – and the PM was flanked by two members of his top team, although they were not drinking. One was wearing a Santa hat and the other draped in tinsel. On Dec 15 last year, 459 people died from coronavirus, while another 33,828 were infected. London was then under Tier 2 regulations banning any social mixing between households – which Mr Johnson appeared to have breached by mixing with the aides. Official guidance also stated: ""You must not have a work Christmas lunch or party, where that is a primarily social activity and is not otherwise permitted by the rules in your tier."" The revelations seriously undermine Downing Street's claims last week that no parties had taken place in No10. Mr Johnson said last week: ""I can tell you guidelines were followed at all times. I've satisfied myself that the guidelines were followed at all times."" But after details emerged of the quiz, a source claimed: ""It was just part of the culture. The PM turned a blind eye.

Teams from the PM's private office, the policy unit and press office were among those taking part. They answered questions on subjects ranging from the history of Downing Street to lyrics of Christmas tunes. A source said of staff's decision to do the quiz in Downing St: ""Everybody decided it would be more fun. It would be difficult to take part in such a large virtual quiz from home. ""No work was discussed, it wasn't a business event. Nobody was working that evening, it was purely a social event."" Halfway through the quiz, the PM surprised staff by turning up on screen as quizmaster for one round lasting between 10 and 15 minutes. He asked questions including: ""At her press conference, how many Covid tests did Priti Patel say had been conducted?"" The PM announced he was giving staff a small gift of a bronze lapel pin of the No10 door – and they were handed out that night. Sources said the quiz finished at around 9pm, but staff stayed on for two hours or so drinking and chatting. Most stayed in their offices, but a few allegedly moved around the building to mingle with colleagues in a further apparent breach of the rules.

At the time we didn't even click that what we were doing was so severely wrong. I've realised now that it was actually pretty outrageous.

Under the Covid regulations at the time, no person could participate in a gathering indoors of two or more people from other households apart from in limited circumstances - including that the gathering was ""reasonably necessary for work"". A legal expert has suggested that No 10 would struggle to claim that a social gathering like a Christmas quiz would fall into that category - even if the PM had just broken off from work for a short time to take part. Some lawyers have suggested No10 could be somehow exempt from the Covid regulations because it is ""crown property"". But Adam Wagner, an expert on Covid regulations, said: ""I'm not convinced. I think the exemption was about government buildings, not people."" Last week, the Metropolitan Police said it would not investigate allegations of Downing Street festive events ""at this time"". Scotland Yard said this was due to an ""absence of evidence"" and its policy not to investigate retrospective breaches of coronavirus regulations. Labour's Shadow Chancellor for the Duchy of Lancaster, Angela Rayner said: ""While the rules said that people shouldn't have Christmas parties at work and Britons across the country were doing the right thing, Boris Johnson was instead happy to preside over a culture of disregard for the rules at the heart of government.

As the Prime Minister announced Plan B restrictions to slow the spread of Omicron, he confirmed a Whitehall probe would be held into a party held on December 18, and any evidence of rule-breaking would be available to any police investigation.

Sources told the Mirror that senior No 10 aides ""were all drinking their socks off"" at the alleged gathering on November 13 last year. Downing Street staff reported hearing ""loud music pumping out of the flat"" late into the night after Mr Cummings, the PM's former top aide, had walked out of No 10. A spokeswoman for Carrie Johnson dismissed the claims as ""total nonsense"". The Department for Education's top official announced that Gavin Williamson's staff party in the run-up to last Christmas will also be investigated by the Cabinet Secretary. No10 also faces questions over a report by the BBC into a Christmas quiz that took place in person at the Cabinet Office with No10 staff joining in. Mr Johnson said he had asked Cabinet Secretary Simon Case to look at allegations relating to December 18, rather than at any other dates. Any aides found guilty of breaking the rules would face disciplinary action. He said: ""As far as I'm concerned, all the evidence I can see is that people in this building have stayed within the rules. If that turns out not to be the case, and people wish to bring allegations to my attention or to the police or whoever, then of course there will be proper sanctions."" Pressed by the Mirror at a No 10 press conference over whether Mr Case would widen the probe, the PM said: ""He may wish to look at other things but that is a matter, frankly, for him."" It came on a dramatic day at Westminster with the Government struggling to get a grip on the fallout from the Mirror's revelations. One of the PM's most senior aides Allegra Stratton tearfully quit after leaked footage showed her laughing and joking about Covid rules while the rest of the country faced restrictions. Mr Johnson claimed he was ""furious"" about the leaked footage of Ms Stratton. He told MPs: ""I apologise unreservedly for the offence that it has caused."" But he prompted disbelief when he shifted the blame on to his officials, insisting he had been repeatedly assured ""there was no party and that no Covid rules were broken"". Labour leader Keir Starmer accused the PM of being ""caught red-handed"" and said that his apology ""raises more questions than answers"". An Opinium poll for Sky News found that just 12% believed the PM was telling the truth over the December 18 party, while 53% thought he should resign. Mr Johnson faces claims that he has seriously damaged the Government's public health messaging as Covid cases again begin to soar. NHS Confederation chief Matthew Taylor said: ""If it feels as though powerful people are not playing by the rules, then there is a blow to morale, it does make it harder to get people to follow the advice."" England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty said: ""We all know people get very angry, including colleagues and friends, when they feel that it's unfair.''

No 10 was thought to be relying on a law which could mean that Covid restrictions do not apply in Government buildings.

351,Real,The Mirror,"Keir Starmer said Boris Johnson has been 'dragged kicking and screaming' to finally tackle sleaze as the Prime Minister proposed a ban on MPs working as paid political consultants or lobbyists Boris Johnson has been shamed into yet another U-turn on lucrative second jobs for MPs just as Labour set out plans to clean up British politics. The Prime Minister caved to pressure to root out sleaze in Parliament by proposing a ban on MPs from working as paid political consultants or lobbyists. He also called for the Commons code of conduct to be updated and for MPs who fail to put their constituents first to be ""investigated and appropriately punished"". Mr Johnson's bid to draw a line under the Tory sleaze row ahead of a crunch vote on Wednesday could hit the financial interests of around 30 MPs. The vast majority of them are Tories who are earning as much as £182,000 a year from outside work - on top of their £81,932 MPs salary. Keir Starmer accused the PM of being ""dragged kicking and screaming"" to finally tackling sleaze. Mr Johnson announced his plans via Twitter just as the Labour leader set out his own overhaul of the disciplinary system in the Commons. Labour had been planning to force a vote to end paid directorships and commercial consultancies during an opposition day debate on Wednesday. Downing Street sources suggested they would ""toughen up"" the Labour-backed motion to include the demand that MPs focus primarily on their constituencies. However, Labour insisted that it would go further if elected and back a ban on all second jobs. Mr Starmer said: ""Be under no illusion, the Prime Minister has only done this because his back was against the wall because the Labour Party have put down a binding vote for tomorrow. ""This is a significant victory for the Labour Party, it would not have happened if we hadn't put down that binding vote. ""This is a Prime Minister who has shown no leadership on this whatsoever."" The PM's announcement was an attempt to move on from the damaging saga that began with his bid to overhaul the standards system to get Tory MP Owen Paterson off the hook. The Tory party has slumped in the polls since the row which has created deep divisions on the party's backbenches. Amid growing anger in his own party, Mr Johnson announced he had written to the Commons Speaker proposing an overhaul to the rules. The PM put forward two recommendations from a report by the Committee on Standards in Public Life in 2018 which he suggested be added to the MPs' code of conduct. These included a ban on acting as paid political consultants and lobbyists, and punishment for MPs who are prioritising their outside interests over their constituents. It means dozens of MPs including ex-Cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell, who receives £182,600 a year from several financial firms, could lose huge outside earnings. Others include former chief whip Julian Smith who takes home £144,000 for advising companies and ex-transport secretary Chris Grayling who earns £100,000 from Hutchinson Ports Europe. No 10 said that Mr Johnson still backed the principle of second jobs - as long as constituents remained a priority for MPs. His spokesman said: ""The committee itself argued that outside interests can enable MPs to remain in touch with a world outside Westminster. ""But the PM agrees that there may be cases where outside interests can lead to undue influence in the political system"". However, there were still questions over how the proposals would work including whether Standards Commissioner Kathryn Stone would have oversight. It was also unclear whether ""reasonable limits"" to outside activity would be defined by hours or pay, and if the ban would be based on the type of organisation an MP worked for or the type of job they did. Mr Johnson told the Speaker that MPs should adopt the plans ""as a matter of urgency"" however the amendment tabled by the Government tonight was criticised for only meaning more talks. Labour accused ministers of ""dirty tricks"" to water down Opposition plans for a binding motion, with guaranteed time for a substantive vote on proposals, to crack down on sleaze. The Government amendment is unspecific about the changes the PM wants to make - and removes the guarantee of a future vote to ban lucrative second jobs as Parliamentary strategists, advisers or consultants. Shadow Commons leader Thangam Debbonaire said: ""Yet again Boris Johnson 's rhetoric is a long way from reality"". Earlier, the Government forced through another humiliating U-turn on the plans to rip up Commons standards rules - after they were blocked by a Tory MP. Ministers had tried to avoid a debate by getting MPs to nod through a late-night motion to reverse the reforms. Theresa May blasted her successor for ""damaging Parliament"" in an excoriating speech as MPs finally backed the U-turn. The former PM said ""damage has been done to all MPs and to Parliament as a whole"" by the way the Owen Paterson affair was handled. Cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg admitted that he encouraged the PM to back the original amendment because he felt Mr Paterson had been ""punished enough"" by his wife's suicide.",Real Mirror,870.0

His plans for Northern Powerhouse Rail – the proposals for an east-west high-speed train line across the North – are also likely to be downgraded. Sources suggest the Tories' integrated rail review will now involve improving existing infrastructure rather than a new line between Manchester and Leeds. The plan is expected to contain £96billion – £40bn of new money – for network improvements. Ministers are set to announce on Thursday that HS2's eastern leg will be scrapped. Kevin Hollinrake, the Tory MP for Thirsk and Malton in North Yorkshire, said the changes indicate the Government is ""not willing to put our money where our mouth is"". Naz Shah, the Labour MP for Bradford West, said: ""This is Boris pulling the whole rug from under our feet and ripping up the floor behind him.""

Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said: ""In the North we know never to trust what the Tories say. ""We were first promised Northern Powerhouse Rail seven years ago. ""Not a yard of track has been laid, and now it never will be. The Northern Powerhouse was a fraud and Boris Johnson is a con artist."" HS2 sources said the impact of dropping the Leeds leg would make journeys 20 minutes longer. The Tories are expected to announce two shorter high-speed routes – between Leeds and Sheffield, and another between Birmingham and East Midlands Parkway – created in part by upgrading existing lines. HS2 between London and Birmingham, and from the Midlands to North West are still going ahead.

353,Real,The Mirror,"The Government has promised MPs a vote next week to reverse their plans to form a new Tory-led ethics body - leaving it to MPs themselves to decide.... but this row is showing no signs of slowing down Environment Secretary George Eustice dismissed Tory sleaze as a ""storm in a teacup"" earlier this week. But every day brings a new set of revelations and Prime Minister Boris Johnson's ratings have plunged to a new row amid the scandal. After months of low-frequency grumblings from backbench Tories, anger with Boris Johnson among his own MPs is tipping over. One backbencher recently predicted there could be a leadership challenge before the next election - if Labour pull ahead in the polls. The MP told the Mirror: ""Nobody wants to go on the ride at Alton Towers for three days - you end up with a massive headache and being sick. ""Sometimes people just want a cheese and pickle sandwich on a park bench."" So how did this all start and what is next for the PM? We have a look. Boris Johnson tried to rip up Commons standards rules claiming they didn't give MPs the chance to appeal. But he linked it to the case of ex-minister Owen Paterson who had been investigated and found guilty by the standards committee of lobbying on behalf of two firms which between them paid him £100k a year. Tory whips strong-armed their MPs to vote for a new Tory-led ethics body - although 13 rebelled - and to get Mr Paterson off the hook. But Opposition parties boycotted the proposed body and Mr Johnson was forced into a humiliating U-turn. With the probity of MPs once again in the spotlight, the media and Opposition parties began investigating a whole slew of other issues - second jobs for MPs, the fate of Delyn MP Rob Roberts, allegations on cash for peerages, Covid contracts and the bankruptcy of Windsor MP Adam Afriyie. More allegations of breaches have been levelled at individual MPs with the Tories potentially facing five serious new standards investigations. Much of the attention has focused on Sir Geoffrey Cox who earns a fortune working as a top-flight lawyer while an MP. Yes - although he denies breaches, and confusingly, much of what's making headlines is actually WITHIN Commons rules. The QC is at the centre of a new sleaze storm after earning more than £1m from legal work in the last year. He clocked in 22 hours a week on average - on top of his £81k job as a Tory MP. Sir Geoffrey appeared in a corruption inquiry on behalf of the British Virgin Islands government on 11 separate days the Commons sat this year. He even cast Commons votes remotely from the tax haven. However, none of that was against the rules - sparking debate about whether the rules on second jobs are fit for purpose. The only alleged breach is when he appeared to do some of his legal work from his office in Parliament. Sir Geoffrey has been reported to the Commons Standards Commissioner, which says Commons resources can't be used for private interests. The September 14 session was part of the corruption inquiry in the British Virgin Islands. At one point, he appeared to refer to the Commons division bell going off to trigger a vote. Mr Cox has not denied using his office but has denied it was a breach. It's not good news for the ordinarily 'telfon' Prime Minister. He faces a furious public backlash to the row with the Tory party tumbling in the polls. There is also anger in the Tory ranks because of the PM opening the floodgates on Tory sleaze - but still refusing to apologise for his handling of the Paterson debacle. The Government faces a barrage of fresh claims about MPs' second jobs and links to lobbying which show no sign of abating, damaging public confidence still further. The PM has been forced to deny claims by Labour that the Government is ""corrupt"". Boris Johnson has signalled the Government could tighten the rules around second jobs. He warned at a press conference in Glasgow it was ""crucial"" MPs follow the rules and put constituents first ""if"" the current system is to stay in place.

Shares in Majid Jafar's UAE-listed Dana Gas have increased by more than 77% in the last year while consumers have been struggling to pay the bills. Ahead of the 2019 election, he donated £4,000 to Mr Kwarteng, a fellow Old Etonian, to campaign in his leafy Surrey constituency. In total, Mr Jafar, chief executive of Crescent Petroleum which is the main founder and largest shareholder in Dana Gas, has donated more than £500,000 to the Conservatives. The party has accepted £424,000 from individuals and companies associated with the oil and gas industry in 2021 alone - despite Boris Johnson 's pledges to cut down on fossil fuels. Energy bills are expected to soar this winter with a worldwide squeeze on gas and energy supplies after a cold winter in Europe last year and increased demand from Asia. About 15m households saw their energy bills rise by 12% last month because of a rise in the energy price cap, with the next increase expected in April. More than 20 domestic suppliers have gone bust while heavily energy reliant industries have warned they are on the brink as historic gas market highs continue to rip through the market. Mr Kwarteng is in charge of both wholesale and retail oil and gas markets. Labour's Shadow energy minister Alan Whitehead said: ""Kwasi Kwarteng was warned 18 months ago of risks in the energy sector, just after he'd been re-elected thanks to a big oil and gas donor. ""The Government that got us into this mess because of a decade of inaction is now paralysed by the scale of the crisis and cannot get us out of it. ""And it is working families who are now paying the price of the Tory energy crisis."" But a spokesman for Mr Kwarteng said: ""The Business Secretary is determined to end Britain's dependency on volatile fossil fuels. ""As the architect of the Energy White Paper and Net Zero Strategy, Mr Kwarteng has developed clear plans to phase out dirty fossil fuels and eradicate the UK's contribution to climate change. ""Any suggestion Mr Kwarteng is somehow not committed to this agenda is hilariously misguided - no other minister has done more set this country on a path to a low carbon future."" He added: ""Despite relentless lobbying effort from big energy companies, Mr Kwarteng has held firm and insisted the energy price cap remains in place to protect consumers this winter. ""Without the cap, energy companies could charge whatever they want and plunge millions into fuel poverty."" A spokesperson for Majid Jafar said: ""Neither Dana Gas nor Mr Jafar has any investments in the UK or European gas sectors. ""Dana Gas operations are solely in the Middle East (Iraq and Egypt) where the natural gas produced is consumed locally replacing dirtier fuels like diesel, enabling local electricity and development while lowering CO2 emissions.""",Real Mirror,536.0
355,Real,The Mirror,"The Mirror has learned the former attorney general missed voting while in Mauritius this week despite facing growing criticism for being abroad while Parliament is sitting Under-fire Sir Geoffrey Cox this week missed yet more Commons votes from abroad - this time from Mauritius more than 6,000 miles from Britain. Sources in the island nation told the Mirror the former attorney general was on a ""short business trip"" there and ""met with quite a few people"" for meetings. The former attorney general is a partner in an international law firm, Thomas More International Ltd, based in the country, which is in the Indian Ocean. Sir Geoffrey is believed to have left Mauritius, with which he has long-standing links, on Tuesday night meaning he missed at least two days when Parliament was in session. While he was away, MPs voted four times on two separate bills - telecommunications and sewage - but he was paired with an Opposition MP for them all meaning he had permission to be absent. Sir Geoffrey, who has not broken any Commons rules by voting from Mauritius and is likely to have had the blessing of the Tory chief whip, has been approached for comment. It comes after Sir Geoffrey faced criticism for working as a legal advisor in the British Virgin Islands for several weeks earlier this year while the Commons was sitting. While his trip to the Caribbean did not break any rules, he has been reported to the standards commissioner after footage emerged of him taking part in later hearings from his Commons office. MPs are banned from using their Parliamentary offices or resources for outside work. Shadow Commons leader Thangam Debbonaire blasted: ""What on earth must Geoffrey Cox's constituents think? ""He is meant to be representing them but instead habitually misses days and days of parliamentary time putting his business interests first. ""The Prime Minister must make Geoffrey Cox choose between putting his constituents first or his own interests."" The top-flight QC has been at the centre of a new sleaze storm after earning more than £1m from legal work in the last year. He clocked in 22 hours a week on average - on top of his £81k job as a Tory MP. Mr Johnson has refused to condemn Sir Geoffrey, arguing that it would be ""inappropriate"" for him to comment on his case. He even argued MPs having second jobs ""has actually strengthened our democracy"" by bringing outside experience to Westminster.  But he added: ""If that system is going to continue today, then it is crucial that MPs follow the rules"" including putting the job of an MP first. Sir Geoffrey visited the British Virgin Islands in April and May this year - 4,000 miles away from his Devon seat - and cast Commons votes remotely from there while doing legal work. He had the permission of chief whip Mark Spencer, already under fire over the Owen Paterson scandal, to vote by proxy while Parliament was sitting. While his trip to the Caribbean did not break any Commons rules, footage has now emerged of Sir Geoffrey taking part in later hearings on September 14. MPs are banned from using their Parliamentary offices or resources for outside work but the video appears to show Sir Geoffrey in an office in Parliament. At one point he gets up, only to tell the hearing later: ""Forgive my absence during some of the morning - I'm afraid the bell went off.""  This is thought to refer to the division bell, which rings loudly across Westminster to alert MPs and peers that they are needed to vote. Records suggest Sir Geoffrey appeared in a corruption inquiry on behalf of the British Virgin Islands government on eleven separate days the Commons sat this year. There were three in May, two in June, two in September and four in October.  Some were in person on a trip to the Caribbean tax haven - while most were virtual after his return to the UK.  By comparison, he has spoken just once in the Commons chamber in the last 18 months. The top Tory had been reported to the standards watchdog by Labour's Angela Rayner who said the alleged use of the office appeared to be ""an egregious, brazen breach of the rules"". She has written to standards commissioner Kathryn Stone asking her for ""guidance on beginning a formal investigation on this matter"".

However, witnesses spotted him on a train that arrived at King's Cross station in London less than half an hour into the Commons clash, which started at 4.07pm and ended at 7.05pm. Last week the PM managed to fly back to London from COP26 in Glasgow in time to make a dinner with friends at a private gentlemen's club. And to further show Mr Johnson's cavalier attitude to rules, he was pictured without a mask while meeting staff at Hexham General Hospital. Keir Starmer accused the PM of hiding away and leaving others to clean up his mess. The Labour leader said: ""The PM is running scared, he's chosen to hide. ""Last week, he damaged himself, his party and our democracy. He led his party through the sewers and the stench lingers. This week he had the chance to clean up, to apologise and finally accept that the rules apply to him and his friends. Instead of stepping up, he has hidden away.

SNP Commons Leader Pete Wishart asked Scotland Yard to investigate whether the ""cash for peerages"" allegations were in breach of the law. Boris Johnson's party has been accused of abusing the honours system by giving seats in the Lords to a select group of donors who each donated large sums to the party. An investigation found that eight of the nine last Tory main treasurers had been offered peerages - with each of those appointed since 2014 donating at least £3m. In his letter to the Met, Mr Wishart wrote that the allegations were ""deeply undermining public trust and confidence"" and should be urgently investigated. He suggested the police should focus on whether Boris Johnson, his immediate predecessors as PM and Tory officials had breached the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925. It is the latest sleaze allegation levelled at Mr Johnson's Government in the wake of the Owen Paterson scandal which saw his personal ratings slump to their lowest ever level. The SNP was behind the original complaints to the Met Police in the cash for peerages scandal that rocked Tony Blair's government in 2006. Scotland Yard has been approached for comment but the Mirror understands that Met chief Dame Cressida Dick has assured a speedy response to the letter.

The Government has said if the health service once again comes under unsustainable pressure it could be forced to bring back coronavirus -1>coronavirus restrictions. Health bosses have been urging over-50s to get Covid booster jabs or face a ""long and difficult winter"" amid concern that waning immunity could lead to high cases. Mr Hopson warned: ""The health service is expecting to see a combination of higher levels of Covid and higher levels of flu this winter while dealing with the backlog of care for patients."" ""The accident and emergency pathway is very, very busy. So, at a point when our staff are really exhausted, it is very worrying. ""The bit that's particularly worrying is acute hospitals, where effectively you look at bed occupancy, which is a very good measure of how busy a hospital is, we're seeing bed occupancy levels of 94, 95, 96%"". He added: ""At this point, before we're into peak winter. We've not seen that before. That's unprecedented. So, there's a real sense that the NHS is going to be under real pressure."" Mr Hopson added that the NHS was ""very worried"" about the impact of compulsory Covid-19 jabs for NHS staff. Ministers warned last week that vaccines would be made compulsory for the NHS's 1.45 million staff in England. But they have faced criticism that forcing frontline personnel to get jabbed is heavy-handed and will lead some to quit. ""The bit that's absolutely vital, and we have seen this in social care, is that if we get this wrong then what will happen is we risk a significant loss of a significant number of staff, just at the point when we cannot afford to lose those staff,"" Mr Hopson added. Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical advisor of the UK Health Security Agency, warned that it looked like the UK was past the current peak cases - but could ""stay at a very high level"".

But the Labour leader warned that suspending parts of the Northern Ireland Brexit deal - designed to keep the border freely flowing - will not resolve the broader dispute. He told the BBC : ""There's a little bit of me that can't help think that the Prime Minister is constantly trying to pick a fight on things like this so he hopes people don't look elsewhere in the forest, which are things like the Owen Paterson affair."" Mr Starmer ruled out rejoining the EU or ""ripping up"" the current deal, instead arguing for ""sensible adjustments"" to be made to improve what is in place. Labour has generally shied away from overtly criticising the Brexit deal after Mr Johnson used the issue to hammer the party in its traditional heartlands at the last general election. But the party leader hammered the Government for its aggressive approach to the ongoing row with the EU over the border. ""I don't think that triggering Article 16 will resolve the dispute in relation to the protocol in Northern Ireland,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr. ""That isn't in the interests of the communities in Northern Ireland or businesses in Northern Ireland. What is in their interests is resolving the issues. ""Because of the way the protocol was drafted, because of what the Prime Minister signed, it is perfectly true that there are checks from Great Britain to Northern Ireland - we want to reduce those."" He added: ""What I am saying is don't rip up the protocol because that has that very important central purpose, which is to protect the no border in Northern Ireland."" Mr Starmer said he wants to see ""both sides sitting down and resolving this."" He said he wanted to ""make Brexit work"" when asked if he was prepared to renegotiate the deal to mitigate the predicted impact on economic growth. The Office for Budget Responsibility, a UK fiscal watchdog, has suggested leaving the EU would reduce the UK's GDP by around 4%. ""It's all very well saying get Brexit done, we've got to make Brexit work,"" Mr Starmer said.  ""In order to do that, we have got to deal with some of the gaps and weaknesses in the current arrangements."" The Labour leader said he would do ""whatever I could to make it easier for British firms to trade across the world, but particularly with the EU"". He went on: ""What I'm not talking about is rejoining the EU, what I'm not talking about is ripping up the current agreement and starting again - nobody wants to be in that place.""",Real Mirror,554.0
362,Real,The Mirror,"Strong words from Labour, SNP and Lib Dem sources after the Owen Paterson debacle, with one source saying 'it's laughable. They didn’t want to listen to anyone yesterday, now they have totally f***ed it up they suddenly need talks' Boris Johnson's chances of pushing through changes to Commons sleaze rules look remote tonight after opposition parties vowed to boycott talks. Labour, SNP and Lib Dem sources told the Mirror that they were unwilling to help the Tories update the Commons standards regime after the Owen Paterson debacle. Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg, announcing the Government's plans to ditch its original plans after a public outcry, admitted they couldn't succeed without cross-party support. Downing Street confirmed that a fresh vote would be held early next week that reverses plans to set up a new Tory-led panel chaired by ex-Culture Secretary John Whittingale. But Opposition parties have told the Mirror they will not change the existing system - which they fear would let more Tory MPs who have breached the rules off the hook. No 10 was forced to deny claims that moves to overhaul the system were a ""pre-emptive strike"" to protect Mr Johnson's own interests from investigation. And some 14 of the 59 backbenchers who supported ripping up the system have broken House regulations - while more are under investigation. The decision to boycott talks for a fresh standards process deals a blow to Mr Johnson's hopes of repairing the damage to the Government's reputation. One Labour insider told the Mirror: ""It's laughable. They didn't want to listen to anyone yesterday, now they have totally f***ed it up they suddenly need talks. ""We've set out our ideas very clearly on cleaning up politics - all they are interested in is letting their MPs off the hook time and time again."" An SNP MP said: ""We'll only sit down with them if we return to the situation that existed before they introduced their motion"". A Lib Dem source added: "" Boris Johnson is terrified about independent probes into his own sleaze scandals and dodgy Covid contracts. ""That's why Tory ministers have tried to undermine the parliamentary standards commissioner at every turn. ""We won't help the Tories rewrite the rules to get the Prime Ministers and his cronies off the hook."" Announcing the U-turn earlier, Mr Rees-Mogg said: ""While there is a very strong feeling on both sides of the House that there is a need for an appeals process there is equally a strong feeling that this should not be based on a single case or applied retrospective. ""I fear last night's debate conflated the individual case with the general concern. This link needs to be broken."" He added: ""Therefore I and others will be looking to work on a cross party basis to achieve improvements to our system in future cases."" Mr Johnson's humiliating climbdown over Commons sleaze rules prompted the dramatic resignation of shamed Tory MP Mr Paterson. The abrupt u-turn meant that the ex-minister, who had escaped sanction for breaching lobbying rules, faced a further vote to suspend him from Parliament. As a result the former environment secretary opted to quit as an MP attacking the ""cruel world"" of British politics. It means there will now be a by-election in his North Shropshire seat, where the Tories currently have a 23,000 majority. Mr Paterson was said to have been informed of the PM's change of heart by a reporter while he was wandering around the supermarket. But rather than face what looked like certain defeat, he declared that he was quitting after almost 25 years in Parliament. In a statement, he said: ""The last two years have been an indescribable nightmare for my family and me. ""My integrity, which I hold very dear, has been repeatedly and publicly questioned. ""I maintain that I am totally innocent of what I have been accused of and I acted at all times in the interests of public health and safety. ""I, my family and those closest to me know the same. I am unable to clear my name under the current system."" Mr Johnson said he was ""very sad"" that Mr Paterson, who he described as a ""friend and colleague"", will leave the Commons. After the public outcry, the PM abandoned his plans to rip up standards procedures just 24 hours after ordering his MPs to back them. No 10 was forced to deny claims that moves to overhaul the system were a ""pre-emptive strike"" to protect Mr Johnson's own interests from investigation. Mr Johnson has been rebuked by the Commissioner on four occasions, most recently over his and wife Carrie's £15,000 holiday to Mustique, although that was later overturned. But in April, he was reported to Ms Stone over the initial redecoration costs of his Downing Street flat, and it has yet to be announced whether the commissioner will investigate. In a chaotic day at Westminster, No 10 initially sent out ministers to fight claims they were returning to the dark days of Tory sleaze. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng even suggested that independent Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone should stand down.",Real Mirror,851.0

Firms listed in the UK will be required by law to publish yearly ""green"" investment plans to move to net zero carbon emissions by the middle of the century. It will pile pressure on businesses like BP and Rio Tinto which rely heavily on fossil fuels to clean up their act in coming decades. Chancellor Rishi Sunak will announce the plans, which are expected to come into force in 2023, at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow today. But they could face an uphill struggle with half of the biggest companies listed in the FTSE index not thought to have any net zero target in place. Under the plans, a new taskforce will be set up to guard against ""greenwashing"", which would be policed by the Financial Conduct Authority. Treasury sources suggested that if businesses plans failed to meet the benchmark, it could result in financial penalties or even being delisted from the stock exchange. In addition, 450 major financial institutions will be encouraged to voluntarily ""disinvest"" from heavily polluting industries like oil and chemicals as part of a global plan to tackle warming. Over $130 trillion - 40% of the world's financial assets - are expected to be aligned with the climate goals set out in the Paris Agreement to keep rising temperatures to 1.5C. Ministers hope the pool of cash could help fund the transition to net zero, including the move away from coal, the shift to electric cars, and the planting of more trees. Mr Sunak will say the UK has a ""responsibility to lead the way"" as he sets out plans for the City to become the world's first net zero financial centre in the world.",Real Mirror,326.0
364,Real,The Mirror,"The move to change the pensions triple lock to a double lock this year has suffered a heavy defeat in the House of Lords Boris Johnson has suffered a heavy defeat over his plans to suspend the pensions triple lock amid warnings that millions of older people could be pushed into poverty. The House of Lords voted by 280 votes to 178, majority 102, to back a cross-party move to keep the link between average earnings and retirement payouts. It means that MPs will be asked to vote again on whether to back the Prime Minister's £5bn raid on pensioners incomes next year. The triple lock mechanism, promised in the Tory manifesto, guarantees state pension rises in line with inflation, earnings or 2.5% - whichever is higher. The Government prompted fury when it confirmed that the link between state pension increases and wage growth would be suspended for a year. It could have meant pensioners received a rise of 8.3% - while many workers have been dealing with job losses, salary cuts and pay freezes. The impact of the pandemic has skewed wage growth figures, producing a spike as a result of people having previously been furloughed and many low-paid jobs disappearing. Former pensions minister Ros Altmann, who led the push, said: ""Most pensioners are not well off and will struggle to cope with the price rises the Government knows are coming down the track. ""We know that heating and food costs are going to rise, yet we are going to see a squeeze in the state pension, which is already very low. ""We already have two million pensioners in poverty and we know that pensioner poverty is on the rise again.' The new amendment would restore the link with earnings but would allow the Chancellor more discretion to adjust the pension rise to account for distortions caused by the pandemic. Dennis Reid of campaign group Silver Voices said: ""This is a life-or-death matter for millions of senior citizens who survive on the meagre state pension alone, and who are in desperate straits because of the surge in energy and fuel prices."" The headline on this story originally said peers had voted to keep an 8.3% rise. This was incorrect because the amendment would restore the link with earnings, but still allow for some adjustment due to the pandemic. Therefore the rise for pensioners would likely be less than 8.3%.",Real Mirror,400.0

The Chancellor gave little support to families struggling with soaring energy bills, tax rises and fears inflation may climb at its fastest in 30 years. But Mr Sunak slashed taxes on sparkling wine and cut air passenger duty for domestic flights. Labour 's Rachel Reeves said: ""Bankers on short flights sipping champagne will be cheering."" Millions of Brits struggling in the cost of living crisis who expected a helping hand from Rishi Sunak 's Budget were left disappointed. The Chancellor did little to boost those hit by soaring energy bills, tax rises and inflation that may rise at its fastest for 30 years. But he did help out the rich by slashing taxes on sparkling wines and air passenger duty on domestic flights. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves accused Mr Sunak of ""pickpocketing"" the poor. She said: ""This Budget did nothing to deal with the spiralling cost of living. ""At least bankers on short-haul flights sipping champagne will be cheering today. ""This country deserves better, but they'll never get it with this Chancellor who gives with one hand, but takes so much more with the other. ""The Prime Minister distracts people with his wild promises. ""All the while, the Chancellor dips his hand in their pockets."" Mr Sunak also boasted about extra cash for schools and local government. But that comes after a decade of Tory cuts to education and town halls that have crippled schools and councils. Mr Sunak reaped the benefits of stronger than expected growth forecasts as the Covid-hit economy recovered. Treasury coffers were boosted by billions through VAT receipts, but households and businesses face major tax hikes with the overall burden reaching its highest level since just after the war. The Office for Budget Responsibility said inflation could reach more than 4% – twice the Bank of England's target – pushing up prices in the shops this winter. But experts warn it may climb as high as 5.4% next year. It threatens the first major rise in base rates – and mortgage rates – in more than a decade. The OBR has predicted the base rate could hit 3.5% – up from 0.1% now. Paul Johnson, director of Institute for Fiscal Studies, warned: ""The expectation for household income increases over the next five years will be pretty stagnant. ""So I'm really sorry to say that actually we're not going to be feeling much better off over the next several years."" After getting to his feet at 12.30pm to deliver his speech, Mr Sunak then did a major U-turn on Universal Credit, which was slashed by £20 a week recently. A cut to the taper, which is how much claimants lose for every hour worked over the allowance, will mean it falls from 63p in the pound to 55p. The Treasury had already announced a national minimum wage rise and the end of the public sector pay freeze, but workers will still face a real terms cut in wages due to inflation. Other announcements included a freeze on fuel duty, a pledge to restore foreign aid spending from 2024/25 and a cut in the levy on bank profits from 8% to 3%.",Real Mirror,592.0

Cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg told MPs the draft scrutiny committee would only report back in December with the legislation only published after that. It is three years since the Government promised a bill to crack down on extreme content and ""clean up"" the internet but it has still not yet put it before the Commons. The PM sounded the warning to social media giants on Wednesday as he told MPs that he would ""bring it forward before Christmas"". He also insisted that the new internet safety laws would impose ""criminal sanctions"" on tech bosses who allow ""foul content"" on their platforms. The Mirror has revealed how major social media platforms are still showing extreme content including far-right racism and islamist extremism despite users urging them to be removed. Instead of committing to the promised timetable, Mr Rees-Mogg told MPs: ""The committee will come up with its wise views before Christmas, and then we will be able to look at that."" His comments suggest that yet another delay could be on the cards. Shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens said: ""It seems that our relief that Boris Johnson had finally understood the urgency of the Online Safety Bill yesterday was premature. ""Not only have the Conservatives U-turned on their commitment to bring the second reading of the Bill to parliament before Christmas, but this also raises questions over whether the PM's promise to bring in criminal sanctions will also be quietly shelved. ""The Online Safety Bill is years overdue. Boris Johnson needs to stick to his promise and the government must stop online spaces from being safe spaces for terrorists."" The legislation is expected to force the biggest tech firms, such as Facebook, Google, Twitter and TikTok, to abide by a duty of care to users, overseen by Ofcom as the new regulator. Mr Johnson told MPs on Wednesday: ""Yes, of course we will have criminal sanctions with tough sentences for those who are responsible for allowing this foul content to permeate the internet."" Under the existing proposals, criminal sanctions are only available as a fallback at the discretion of a Government minister. But the PM appeared to go further by suggesting that tougher punishments would be the automatic default for tech bosses who failed to act. His commitment took some Government officials by surprise, with one source saying they had expected the legislation to be ""watered down"" rather than toughened up. However, another insider suggested that new Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries could take a tougher approach on sanctions than her predecessor Oliver Dowden.

367,Real,The Mirror,"EXCLUSIVE: A Hope Not Hate investigation found that social media giants are hosting 'extreme hate' videos which breach their own rules, despite calls to remove the content Extreme content including far-right racism and Islamist extremism is still being shown on social media sites despite calls to remove it. Dozens of examples were found online even though they breached tech giants' own rules, an investigation by Hope Not Hate found. Disturbing TikTok posts, seen by the Mirror and since removed, include videos of right-wing extremist Tommy Robinson and supporters of banned terror group al-Muhajiroun. Researchers also found examples of death threats, Covid vaccine misinformation, Holocaust denial and homophobic content on the site which is viewed by a billion people every month. Social media experts warn extreme content is found across all the main social media platforms including Facebook and YouTube. The Mirror revealed this week that almost 40 hours of video rants by hate preacher Anjem Choudary can easily be seen online. YouTube removed them when he was jailed in 2016 but just one Google search provided 27 links. Boris Johnson yesterday insisted that new online safety legislation will impose criminal sanctions on tech bosses who allow such material on their platforms. The Prime Minister told MPs the Online Harms Bill will make progress in the Commons before Christmas. It is expected to force giants such as Facebook, Google, Twitter and TikTok to abide by a duty of care to users, overseen by regulator Ofcom. Mr Johnson told MPs: ""Yes, of course we will have criminal sanctions with tough sentences for those who are responsible for allowing this foul content to permeate the internet."" Under the existing proposals, criminal sanctions are only available as a fallback at the discretion of a Government minister. But the PM appeared to go further by suggesting that tougher punishments would be automatic for tech bosses who failed to act. However, his commitment took some Government officials by surprise. One told the Mirror they had expected the bill to be ""toothless"" after ministers agreed to ""water it down"" in the face of threats from tech giants to withdraw investment from the UK. His tougher stance came after Labour leader Keir Starmer had urged a serious crackdown, telling MPs at Prime Minister's Questions: ""It's three years since the Government promised an Online Safety Bill but it's not yet before the House. Meanwhile, the damage caused by harmful content online is worse than ever. ""We do need tough and effective sanctions, and that means criminal sanctions. It is beyond belief that, as the Mirror reported yesterday, 40 hours of hateful content from Anjem Choudary could be easily accessed online. ""The Government could stop this by making it clear that directors of companies are criminally liable for failing to tackle this type of material on their sites."" The Hope Not Hate investigation, revealed by Labour, found evidence on TikTok of rants by right-wing extremist Robinson, also known as Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, as well as from Holocaust denier David Irving and al-Muhajiroun. It also found multiple examples on Telegram – which has 550million monthly users – of misogyny and homophobia as well as calls for politicians to be killed. Following the murder of Tory MP Sir David Amess last week, MPs have raised concerns about death threats and abuse from anonymous social media accounts. Joe Mulhall of Hope Not Hate said: ""There is a systemic issue with the way in which TikTok moderates its content. We found instances of racism, holocaust denial and far-right extremism on the platform with relative ease. ""But TikTok is not alone in hosting content that promotes extreme hate. After a decade of trying to fix this issue, it has become clear that social media companies cannot be trusted to regulate their own content. ""We found countless examples of vile, threatening, and at times illegal content across every social media platform. Far too often, the algorithms used on social media apps mean that people do not have to search for extremist content – it is recommended to them. ""These tech platforms are some of the biggest companies in the world, and yet they have continually failed to sufficiently address what is now a systemic and dangerous problem."" Chloe Colliver of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue think tank said the gap between online and offline lines is narrowing. She added: ""Terrorist, extremist and hateful content can both be a mirror of the uglier sides of the offline world as well as a trigger for offline actions. ""Online platforms are built to try to affect people's behaviours and attitudes; it's their business model. ""When tech companies target and amplify hateful and extremist content, it can make those views seem normal and popular.

Mr Buchanan welcomed measures to address recruitment issues but warned they were not having an ""immediate effect just yet"". Asked by committee chair Darren Jones how long it would take for the benefits to be felt, he replied: ""We think it's going to be a year to recover from where we are at the moment."" Figures revealed by the Office for National Statistics show that driver numbers have plunged by 53,000 over the past four years. This is largely driven by retiring drivers not being replaced fast enough by new recruits. Mr Buchanan added: ""I know there are a number of measures that have been put in place, stepping up training, stepping tests, but on the ground that isn't having much of an effect.""

The Chancellor is reportedly considering cutting the 5% rate even though he has resisted pressure to splash taxpayers' cash elsewhere. Treasury officials played down the likelihood of Mr Sunak announcing a cut amid concerns he might set a precedent with the annual cost reaching £1.5bn. Cutting taxes on energy ahead of the UN COP26 climate summit in Glasgow - when the Government will call on other wealthy nations to do more - could also be controversial. However, the Tories are thought to be looking for measures which could also allow Boris Johnson to hail a Brexit benefit, as VAT rates on domestic fuel are set centrally within the EU. One Treasury official told the Financial Times: ""It would tick two boxes - it reminds people of the benefits of Brexit and shows you're listening to people.""

More families in England turned to schools for support due to pressures linked to the Covid crisis, according to research by UCL's Institute of Education. Schools serving populations with high levels of poverty shouldered a higher burden of dealing with food insecurity and inadequate housing. Researchers have warned that pupil premium funding, which is targeted at poorer children, does not cover the work schools do to support children living in poverty. One of the report's authors Prof Alice Bradbury said: ""Schools are picking up the pieces from a welfare and social services system that no longer provides a real safety net for families. ""For those schools, the impacts of poverty on children's lives are impossible to ignore."" They interviewed 50 parents and staff across seven primary schools in England and found food insecurity was the most pressing priority for them all. Schools went to great lengths to ensure pupils received at least one meal a day - in some cases distributing food directly to the door. One headteacher said: ""What we've noticed over time was that the people who were coming to our food pantry, and we still run it now, weren't the free school meal parents. ""It was this tier just above, the people who'd been furloughed, the people who had always had a job."" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT school leaders' union, said: ""Our members tell us that children's worries leave them unable to learn and enjoy school and in need of help in the form of food, clothing and basic supplies.

'We know that even before coronavirus, 4.3 million children and young people were growing up trapped in poverty and this is only going to be made worse as the pandemic continues to take its toll. ""Covid-19 has exposed the endemic levels of poverty and inequality in the UK."" A Government spokeswoman said: ""Throughout the pandemic we ensured schools supported the most disadvantaged children by staying open to vulnerable pupils, and delivering free school meals to those learning remotely. ""We have also increased pupil premium funding, expanded the holiday activities and food programme, and extended breakfast clubs, in addition to our investment of more than £3 billion to make up for time lost in the classroom.

A joint probe by the Commons health and science committees found ministers made a ""serious error"" by taking a ""gradual and incremental"" approach to lockdowns last year. Experts said shutting down a week earlier than March 23, 2020, would have cut the 40,000 death toll in the first wave ""by at least half"". The first major probe into the government's handling of the Covid pandemic branded the delay ""one of the most important public health failures"" the UK had ever suffered. The MPs said: ""It is now clear this was the wrong policy, and that it led to a higher initial death toll than would have resulted from a more emphatic early policy. In a pandemic spreading rapidly and exponentially every week counted.""

Jo Goodman, co-founder of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, said: ""Although this report falls well short of holding those in power during the pandemic to account, it still manages to identify clear and catastrophic mistakes which led to tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths."" She said: ""These failings must now be investigated by an independent, statutory inquiry in which our perspective is listened to. Only this will provide lessons that can protect lives in future and the closure bereaved families need."" The MPs did applaud the vaccine roll-out as ""one of the most effective initiatives"" in UK history and praised the NHS, businesses and officials for making it possible. The report said: ""Ministers were correct to identify that a vaccine would be the long-term route out of the pandemic and presciently supported their research and development."" It said the success of the vaccine programme had ""redeemed"" many of the Government's failings. Those failings included a decision last autumn to ignore scientific advice for a two-week circuit-breaker which could have saved thousands of lives. It meant there was a month's lockdown, apart from schools, in November as the Alpha variant spread through the UK. The report said: ""Ministers were clearly over-optimistic in their assumption that the worst was behind us during the summer months of 2020."" Further failings included delays in bringing in self-isolation rules, ""light-touch"" border controls that permitted more cases to enter the country and regional tiers which were not ""watertight"" enough to prevent infections. There was also little scientific evidence for measures such as the 10pm curfew on pubs brought in last September, which had pushed some businesses to the brink. MPs slammed the government's preparations for the pandemic and suggested that the Army play a more central role in future outbreaks, while the NHS should have a permanent register of volunteers. The MPs concluded care homes were not given sufficient priority in the early stages of the pandemic. The report said: ""It put massive strain on a social care sector already under huge pressure. ""Social care had a less prominent voice in government during the early stages of the pandemic than the NHS."" They warned that issues around funding and staffing in social care should be resolved ""urgently"". Existing problems would be ""compounded"" this winter by making it compulsory for all staff to have Covid-19 vaccinations. In a joint statement, committee chairmen Jeremy Hunt and Greg Clark said: ""The UK response has combined some big achievements with some big mistakes."" They said: ""It is vital to learn from both to ensure we perform as best as we possibly can during the remainder of the pandemic and in the future."" Worryingly, the report concluded that ""pandemics like Covid-19 will become more common"".",Real Mirror,871.0
373,Real,The Mirror,"More than 500,000 households will be affected by £20-a-week cuts to the benefit in 54 constituencies seized by the Tories in 2019 More than £500 million will be cut from the incomes of people across dozens of 'red wall' seats as a result of brutal Tory universal credit cuts. New analysis shows that a total of 501,370 households, including 340,000 children, will be affected in the 54 constituencies taken by the Tories in 2019. More than 200,000 working people in receipt of the benefit in those areas will see their income slashed by more than £1,000 a year. Charities and economists have warned that millions of families could be pushed into poverty by the move which kicked in this week. Many are already struggling to make ends meet as they grapple with a cost of living crisis that has pushed up energy bill and food prices. Analysis by Labour using figures from anti-poverty charity Joseph Rowntree Foundation found that in nine 'red wall' seats taken by the Tories, more than 12,000 households will be affected by the cut, including Blackpool South, Bolton North East, Burnley and Heywood and Middleton. Another eight 'red wall' seats, including Great Grimsby, Darlington, Lincoln and two Stoke-on-Trent constituencies, will each see more than 10,000 families hit. Shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: ""Hardworking people in these constituencies been let down by Conservative tax hikes, supply shortages and cuts to Universal Credit. ""Any promise the Prime Minister makes to raise the living standards of people in this country rings hollow while this cut goes ahead. ""They deserve much better than the bluff and bluster of a Government determined to make things harder for working people."" The worst 'red wall' seat affected is Peterborough, where 18,360 households, including 13,000 children, will be hit by the £20-a-week cut, losing £19m pounds between them. They include 4831 people in work. Tory Paul Bristow, who took the swing-seat off Labour in 2019 with a majority of just 2,580, has previously suggested keeping the uplift in place would be too expensive. Next worst is Birmingham Northfield, a marginal seat taken by the Tories for the first time in 27 years at the last election, where 13,480 households, including 10,000 children, will lose £14m between them. More than 4,800 working people will be hit. Tory MP Gary Sambrook has said the Government is improving living standards by creating jobs instead and accused Labour of ""posturing, causing division where there isn't any"" on the cuts.

The constituencies of high-profile 2019 intake Tory MPs will also be badly affected by the UC cut, including Dehenna Davison's Bishop Auckland, Christian Wakefield's Bury South and James Grundy's Leigh. More than 9,000 households, including 6,500 children, in Lee Anderson's Ashfield will lose £9.5m while the cut will hit 9480 households, including 6,294 children, to the tune of £9.9m in Jacob Young's seat of Redcar. Just four Tory MPs voted against the Government's UC cut, which kicks in from this week, in a Labour-held vote on the move last month.

NHS data said they make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care. Officials fear early guidance for expectant mothers to avoid the jab until there was more evidence it was safe has put many off. But the advice changed as getting Covid can be dangerous for pregnant women. Some badly hit have had Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation therapy. It is only used when lungs are so damaged a ventilator cannot maintain oxygen levels. Out of all women between 16 and 49 on the special machine, pregnant women make up 32%, up from 6% at the start of lockdown. England's top midwife will today try to reassure women to get the vaccine. Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent said: ""This is another stark reminder the jab can keep you, your baby and your loved ones safe. ""You can receive vaccination at any time in pregnancy, but the risks unvaccinated pregnant women face of becoming severely unwell if they catch Covid show exactly why we advise you to do so as soon as possible"". Claire Bromley, 33, of Kent, spent nearly a month in a critical care unit after catching Covid while pregnant. Recovering at home, she said: ""The risk of not having the Covid vaccine far outweighs any doubts about having it."" Public Health England said more than 81,000 pregnant women have received their first dose while 65,000 have had their second shot. Carrie Johnson, who is pregnant with her second child, became fully vaccinated this summer and urges others to do the same. The PM's wife understand people's fears but said the evidence was ""reassuring"" and there was no increased risk of miscarriage. Vaccination during pregnancy is urged by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Royal College of Midwives. Data from 100,000 jabs among UK mums-to-be and 160,000 in the US show there has been no harm to the foetus or infant. Dr Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: ""The disproportionate number of unvaccinated pregnant women in intensive care demonstrates a significant risk of severe illness from Covid-19 in pregnancy."" There are concerns the vaccine rollout is faltering with only one in nine secondary school pupils in England inoculated so far. Experts warned the slow pace risks the health of children and their older relatives with Covid deaths still averaging 120 a day.

Ministers have been warned that one in five posts on some wards are vacant as recruitment from the European Union has collapsed. It comes as the UK faces an ""uncertain"" winter as it tackles both flu and Covid-19 according to the chief of the Health Security Agency. Dr Jenny Harries has warned there is lower immunity to flu this year which experts have warned could take 60,000 lives this winter. ""Early evidence suggests that you are twice as likely to die from having two together, than just having Covid alone,"" she said. ""So I think it's an uncertain winter ahead."" The most recent NHS figures show there are about 39,000 vacancies for registered nurses in England. One in 10 nursing posts on acute wards in London and one in five on mental health wards in the South East are unfilled. Yet the number of nurses from Europe has fallen from more than 90% - from 9,389 in 2015/16 to 810 in 2020/21. Thousands of nursing shifts each week cannot be filled because of staff shortages, according to hospital safe staffing reports seen by the Observer. NHS trusts are being paid by NHS England up to £7,000 for each vacant post to try to recruit nurses from overseas countries - including India and the Philippines. Patricia Marquis, of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ""There just aren't enough staff to deliver the care that is needed, and we now have a nursing workforce crisis. ""We should never have got into a position where we were so dependent on international nurses. We are on a knife-edge."" Saffron Cordery, deputy of NHS Providers, called for a fully costed workforce plan in the Government's spending review later this month. ""We've had workforce shortages for many years, and we've seen that exacerbated by Brexit,"" she said. ""The workforce is the engine of any hospital and when you have shifts that aren't filled, that's a huge challenge."" Meanwhile, pharmacists will be given the right to write prescriptions under plans being considered by Sajid Javid to free up GPs. The health secretary last month vowed the Government will ""do a lot more"" to ensure GPs see more patients face-to-face following complaints from the public. The proposals would see more prescriptions provided through pharmacies and hospitals for routine illnesses to allow doctors more time to see patients in person. About 80% of GP appointments were face-to-face before the pandemic but the numbers fell during lockdowns and are still only 58%. GPs would also be able to pass off bureaucratic requests like providing supporting medical evidence to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency over a patient's fitness to drive. The plans are expected to include sanctions for doctors who do not increase the number of face-to-face appointments with patients. A Department of Health source said: ""Sajid Javid is determined that he proportion of face-to-face appointments go up.

The travel 'red list' has been slashed from 54 countries to just seven from 4am on Monday in a boost to families hoping to take half-term breaks abroad. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced the long-awaited update to the system last week - with South Africa and Thailand also removed from the list. Indonesia has also been taken off the red list opening up tourist destination islands like Bali. It means Brits returning from those countries will no longer have to have to isolate in a hotel for 11 nights at a cost of £2,285. And those countries' residents and nationals will finally be allowed to visit the UK again after months of a total ban. The only seven countries that now remain on the red list are Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Venezuela. It comes after the Foreign Office lifting its advice against non-essential travel to a further 42 countries and territories due to the coronavirus pandemic. This makes it easier for people to obtain travel insurance for trips to those destinations. There are now also two sets of rules for people coming from the rest of the world to the UK depending on their vaccination status. Children and fully-vaccinated adults arriving from the rest of the world now only have to take one test - a 'Day 2' PCR test after landing. There's no need to isolate, and no need to take a ""pre-departure"" test before flying. The Day 2 test will also be replaced with a cheaper lateral flow later this month, of which passengers will simply able to send a photo to the authorities. But the plan to replace day 2 PCR Covid tests with cheaper lateral flow tests for the fully jabbed is causing rifts in the Cabinet and has yet to be given a launch date. The Department for Transport has said the new testing rules will come in by the end of October which may be too late for thousands of families planning a half-term break overseas. They would be forced to shell out more cash on expensive PCR tests. The Foreign Office has also axed advice against non-essential travel to a further 42 countries and territories due to the coronavirus pandemic, making it easier for people to obtain travel insurance for trips to those destinations. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said on Friday: ""These updates make travel abroad easier - boosting trade, tourism and reuniting friends and families.

Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want to see the return of bubbles where whole classes or year groups were sent home after a positive test. But he admitted that compulsory face-masks in lessons could make a come-back if cases spike. ""I've got a contingency plan, as you would expect me to do. It contains lots of contingencies, including masks, absolutely,"" he told Sky News. The mandatory wearing of face coverings in schools and colleges was scrapped in May, but Government guidance says that directors of public health could advise schools to reintroduce them if cases spike. It comes after Government figures showed the number of children out of school for Covid-19 related reasons in England increased by two thirds in a fortnight. The DfE estimates that 2.5% of all pupils - more than 204,000 children - were not in class for reasons connected to coronavirus on Thursday last week. This is up from 122,300 children, or 1.5% of all pupils, on September 16 - a 67% rise from two weeks ago. Mr Zahawi also defended the slow rollout of carbon dioxide monitors which were first promised by the Department for Education in August. In Wales, secondary school and college pupils will be advised to take daily lateral flow tests for seven days if someone in their household tests positive for coronavirus, the Welsh Government has announced. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Zahawi said he was concerned about the impact Covid-19 measures had on attendance. He said: ""The good news is that - and thanks to the brilliant teachers and support staff and parents and children - 99% of schools are open. ""Attendance has gone up, the last set of figures I looked at was about 90%, which obviously will fluctuate depending on infection rates. ""But my priority is to protect education, keep those schools open."" But he said he was not looking to return to the bubble system to do so, ""because actually, you saw the fall off in attendance which really does harm mental wellbeing, mental health of children"". That is despite Englnad's schools previously being told backup plans must ""cover the possibility that in some local areas it may become necessary to reintroduce 'bubbles' for a temporary period, to reduce mixing between groups.

Echoing his idol's words, the PM insisted there is ""no alternative"" but to slash the extra £20 a week lifeline that has been helping struggling families just about stay afloat. Mr Johnson will plough ahead with the cut, which comes into effect on Wednesday as he addresses the Tory conference in Manchester. His stubborn insistence will hit four million poor families the hardest as they already grapple with a cost-of-living crisis, rising National Insurance and Covid job losses. UC recipients told how having the vital £20 a week snatched away could leave them making desperate choices between heating and eating. But ignoring the pleas that have rang around the country as he prepares to axe the benefit, Mr Johnson said: ""In a famous phrase, there is no alternative."" Mrs Thatcher uttered those words in the 80s to justify her reliance on the private sector and the market as she devastated communities by shutting mines, ship yards and steel works and battered public services. Nearly six million households rely UC and 40% of claimants are in work. Cutting the extra £20 will cost them £1,040 a year. Recipient Suzie Mead, 36, has a son with cancer and said losing the cash will be ""the difference between taking your child to hospital and paying the bills"". Another, Gemma Widdowfield, 36, added: ""It's not a matter of greed, this is a matter of survival."" Big Issue founder John Bird warned the cut could spark a ""mass homelessness crisis"". He said 4.3m people are behind on bills and 564,000 in rent arrears. Mr Johnson has brushed off pleas from Labour, unions, landlords, charities and even his own MPs to keep the £20 a week lifeline.

Boris Johnson's special envoy to Afghanistan, Sir Simon Gass, sat down with the group to discuss the humanitarian crisis facing the country. The top diplomat also told them they had a duty to make sure the nation did not once again descend into a haven for terrorists. Foreign Office officials said Sir Simon stressed the need for continued safe passage for Afghans who had helped the British mission who wanted to leave. And he raised the treatment of women and girls after the Taliban effectively banned girls from secondary education by ordering high schools to re-open only for boys. The talks are a significant development as they suggest that UK efforts to help thousands more people leave the country remain a priority. The Taliban has been in control since the fall of the western-backed government in August, which followed the chaotic withdrawal of US and UK troops. Britain does not intend to recognise the Taliban as the government of Afghanistan any time in the near future. But ex-foreign secretary Dominic Raab announced earlier this month that the UK would start engaging directly with the Islamist group. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace warned that the military withdrawal from Afghanistan had created opportunities for both China and Islamist terrorists. He told a fringe event at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester: ""Who popped up immediately as the US and Nato were leaving, but China, offering to invest in Afghanistan?

Meanwhile out of touch Mr Sunak, left, was stumped at the cost of a can of beans. With millions already in poverty, he had the opportunity to show the Tories are serious about levelling up by axing the £20 Universal Credit cut. But the Chancellor, who is married to a billionaire's daughter, condemned many more to a life of misery after he refused to scrap the vital benefit which helps poor families stay afloat amid the cost-of-living crisis. And he sparked fury by dismissing the genuine fears of those who will be hit hardest by the cut by declaring: ""Is the answer to their hopes and dreams just to increase their benefits?"" Many people claiming UC are in work but their wages are so dire they need the extra £20 just to survive. The cruel blow comes on top of a National Insurance hike and after more than a decade of austerity. In an example of how out of touch Mr Sunak is with the ordinary people he is battering, he could not say when quizzed how much a tin of beans costs. The Chancellor, who has plans for a swimming pool, gym and tennis court at his £1.5million Yorkshire manor, rejected pleas by Labour, unions, landlords, charities and Tory MPs to keep the payment.

Mr Sunak was asked by LBC radio host Nick Ferrari what was the price of a tin of Heinz beans. He replied: ""I don't know … 50-ish p maybe?"" It costs 95p. When told, Mr Sunak did not stop digging: ""95? OK. I get the smaller packet ones though..."" One community worker even put a shopping list together to show him how much food families would lose after the £20 cut. Rayna Downey, from Northern Ireland's Women's Centre, Derry, said the extra cash helps households eat. She added: ""I wanted to see what you could realistically provide for your family. ""And it turns out you can do pretty well with four or five dinners, your breakfast and lunch. It's the basics, yes, but it goes to show that £20 can go a long way. ""I've made five cracking dinners, everyone's had lunch and cereal for breakfast, tea, coffee or whatever. ""Now that's going, and even more people are going to end up struggling."" Childminder Caroline Rice is one of around 40% of UC claimants who are working, but need it to top up low pay. The 48-year-old, from Co. Fermanagh, said: ""I don't know how I will manage with the £20 a week taken away. That's nearly £90 every payment term. We've cut all our outgoings as much as we can and I've got to the point where we can't cut any more. We barely get by every month. ""I need my car for work. I can't stop paying my rent or stop eating. We've already cut our TV licence. The debts that I already have are never going to be paid and it's just going to grow."" But Mr Sunak's patronising message to people such as Caroline in his speech to Tory conference was to tell them stand on their own two feet. He said: ""Is the answer to tell a young family, the economic system is rigged against you and the only way you stand a chance is to lean ever more on the state?"" The former Goldman Sachs banker, who is thought to be the richest MP, also claimed ""we should all be grateful"" to the Tories for a decade of ""sound management"" of the economy. But he ignored the devastating effects of austerity, which has plunged millions of Britons into poverty and crippled public services such as schools and hospitals. The Chancellor, who went to a top boarding school and Oxford University, was once snapped with a £180 heated bluetooth coffee mug as Britain braced itself for a wave of Covid job losses. But he told activists that he would only consider cutting taxes once the public finances are on a ""sustainable footing"" following the pandemic. He said: ""Our recovery comes with a cost."" Mr Sunak refused to rule out more tax rises after the hike in National Insurance that comes in next April. That means higher bills for council tax, which has soared by above inflation for years, to pay for social care.

The Tory peer accused the PM of ""sloganising"" to win over voters but failing to set out detailed plans for what his promise actually meant. And he criticised the Government for failing to ""face the facts"" and apply the political will needed to reduce regional inequalities across the country. The new Levelling up minister, Michael Gove, fell flat after he tried to put meat on the bones of the slogan in his keynote speech at Tory conference in Manchester today. Lord Heseltine, who was Margaret Thatcher's deputy, slammed the speech: ""It's very easy to keep sloganising, but they've been doing that for nearly two years and they have wasted that period of their power with a large majority. ""No one listening to his speech who is interested in the subject of levelling up is any wiser than they were before the speech."" The Tory peer, who led major regeneration projects in London Docklands and Liverpool while in power, accused Mr Johnson of lacking the political will to make the necessary change. ""The sad truth is that the Government is surrounded by advisers who have lived through these issues, who know the arguments backwards,"" he told Sky News. ""What is missing is the political will to take difficult decisions. It is that decision making on which that levelling up agenda can be put underway."" He added: ""The truth is that we know how to level up, we know how to improve the conditions in deprived areas, we've done it conspicuously in many parts of the country. ""But this Government simply doesn't face the facts about how it needs to be done and the single minded purpose that has got to be applied to it."" Mr Gove is due to publish a white paper on the Government's levelling up plans in the next few weeks - and Lord Heseltine suggested it could be why he had held back on setting out detail in his speech. Lord Heseltine said the key to reducing regional inequalities would be to give more power to local decision makers. The Government had failed to offer a ""strategic assessment"" on what needed to be done and had resorted to pumping out ""well-sounding phrases"" which could have been used at any stage by any government over his political career. ""You've got to take difficult decisions and they are urgent and they mean putting people in charge who are elected locally,"" he added. During the development of the London Docklands in the 1980s, for every £1 of public money spent another £10 of private funding was invested. ""Even in Liverpool, in the darkest days, for every pound of public money, we got £1.50 of private money."" In his speech, Mr Gove told delegates that levelling up means helping everyone ""live their best life"" as he joked about his exploits in an Aberdeen nightclub. The Communities Secretary was caught on camera throwing shapes on the dance-floor during a summer visit to the Pipe club. With Abba's Dancing Queen played in the auditorium before he arrived on stage, Mr Gove opened by saying: ""Here we are - bright lights, great atmosphere, enthusiastic young people. ""It reminds me of my last night out on the town in Aberdeen - dance like nobody's watching they say. ""Well I did, but they were watching."" Mr Gove said that he had a four-point plan for levelling up - but that every Government department had to play their part. He said: ""We want to strengthen local leadership - great mayors like Andy Street, driving real change. ""We also want to raise living standards, especially where they are lower. We want to improve public services, especially where they are weaker.

A full-time working couple with two children would be £23 a week worse off over the next six months. A single parent working part-time could see their income fall by £20 a week over the same period. Even a low earner without children working full-time on the national living wage would see the £9 a week income boost from a planned rise wiped out by the soaring cost of living. Mike Brewer, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""This new Household Support Fund should provide vital support for low-income families who are really struggling with Britain's ongoing cost of living crisis, and who are able to access the scheme. ""But while welcome, these grants won't come close to covering the far wider £20 a week losses that will result from cutting Universal Credit, and which will affect over four million families across the country."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who was planning to announce the fund in his Tory conference speech next week before details were leaked, said: ""Everyone should be able to afford the essentials, and we are committed to ensuring that is the case."" But around 4.4 million households across the UK will start losing their £20-a-week UC lifeline from next week. It will leave the average family £107-a-month worse off, according to the Resolution Foundation. Shopping bills will continue to soar due to rising inflation which is expected to hit 4% - the highest in a generation - over winter. Energy costs will jump for 15m households on the energy price cap from next month, meaning a £139 average annual increase. Fuel prices have already risen as a result on ongoing supply shortages at the pumps. The new health and social care tax also kicks in from next April. A 37p increase in the hourly national living wage and a higher than usual benefits uprating due to inflation should relieve some pressure next Spring. Separately, the £70bn furlough schemes will end next month - with uncertainty for the future of almost one million workers still receiving support. The £500m hardship programme will replicate last year's Winter Covid Grant and cover daily needs such as food, clothing, and utilities from next month. Labour described the new scheme as a ""temporary and inadequate"" sticking plaster to the cost of living crisis. Shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: ""Conservative choices have created a perfect storm this winter. ""They have left working people facing tax hikes, an energy crisis and cuts to Universal Credit. ""Temporary and inadequate sticking plasters are no substitute for a proper social security system that offers security to families in hard times.""",Real Mirror,560.0
383,Real,The Mirror,"Senior Labour MP Harriet Harman warned that women's confidence in the police had been 'shattered' by the shocking crime Metropolitan Police Chief Cressida Dick is facing calls to quit after police officer Wayne Couzens was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of Sarah Everard. The Met stands accused of failing to spot that the former firearms officer was a risk to women, despite flashing allegations and reportedly being nicknamed 'The Rapist' by colleagues. Two forces are investigating the Met's failure to look into the previous allegations and a senior investigator in the case has said that Couzens ""should never have been near a uniform"". Senior Labour MP Harriet Harman QC, a former justice minister, is now demanding that Dame Cressida is now held accountable. Home Secretary Priti Patel branded Couzens a ""monster"" and said the force had ""serious questions"" to answer. But she said she would ""continue to work with"" Dame Cressida and the Met Police, when pressed on whether to top officer should resign. Dame Cressida said Couzens ""has brought shame"" on the Met Police and ""eroded"" public confidence in the police. She said: ""There are no words that can fully express the fury and overwhelming sadness that we all feel about what happened to Sarah. I am so sorry."" Couzens, who strangled Sarah with his police belt after kidnapping her under the guise of a fake arrest for breaking lockdown rules, was today handed a rare whole life-term, meaning he will die in prison. The 48-year-old used his Metropolitan Police-issue warrant card and handcuffs to snatch Sarah as she walked home from a friend's house in South London on the evening of March 3. Her kidnap, rape and murder by a serving police officer led to vigils and protests about violence against women across the country. But the Met Police was criticised for its heavy handling of the vigil in Clapham, near where Sarah was abducted, while Covid lockdown rules were still in place. Ms Harman, a leading women's rights campaigner, is an expert on the criminal justice system so her intervention will be particularly damaging for Britain's top police officer. In a letter to Home Secretary Priti Patel, she writes: ""Women must be able to have confidence in the police. They must be able to trust them, not fear them. ""A serving police officer abducted Sarah Everard using his powers of arrest in order to then rape and kill her. The confidence of women in the police will have been shattered. ""It is clear that there had been all too many warning signs about him which had been swept under the carpet. It cannot be rebuilt with the attempt to reassure that this was just, as the Metropolitan Police Commissioner said, one 'bad-un'."" Ms Harman called for a series of changes to help restore confidence in the police and avoid a similar tragedy from happening again. She said: ""I think it is impossible for the Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick to oversee this programme and I have therefore called on her to resign."" These include immediate suspension of all serving officers who face an allegation of violence against a woman, then sacking them if they admit guilt or are convicted. Pre-screening of new recruits should include scrutiny of their attitudes to violence against women, including violence during sex. Any officers transferring between forces should face fresh checks and existing police should complete a course to examine their own, and colleagues, attitudes to such behaviour. Her final recommendation was that failing to report a fellow officer for an allegation should be treated as gross misconduct leading to dismissal. Dame Cressida's contract as the UK's most senior police officer was extended by two years earlier this month. But she had already faced criticism over the force's handling of the Sarah Everard vigil, the Daniel Morgan murder case and high youth violence. Ms Harman also wrote directly to the Met chief, telling her she must step down after the ""heartbreaking and horrifying"" killing of Sarah, 34, by a serving police officer. She added: ""I think it is not possible for you to lead these necessary actions in the Metropolitan Police. ""I am sure that you must recognise this, and I ask you to resign to enable these changes to be taken through and for women to be able to have justified confidence in the police."" During her time as justice minister, Ms Harman introduced the right in 2005 for bereaved families of murder victims to make a statement about how the crime had affected them before sentencing. Asked if Dame Cressida should resign, Ms Patel said: ""There are important questions and questions that I've been asking and challenges, we have to be honest about this, in particular to this case, but also the conduct of that serving officer and conduct of policing more broadly. ""So, I will continue to work with the Metropolitan Police and the Commissioner to hold them to account as everybody would expect me to do, and I will continue to do that."" She described Sarah's murder as ""an appalling tragedy"".",Real Mirror,847.0

In a powerful speech to his party's conference in Brighton, the Labour leader faced down left-wing hecklers and closed the door firmly on the Jeremy Corbyn era. He reached out to voters who switched to the Tories at the last election telling them Labour would again be a patriotic, pro-business party that took care with taxpayers' money. In a sign of the changing direction of the party, he praised Tony Blair 's record in office. ""You want levelling up? That's levelling up,"" he told them. There were big new policy pledges on mental health treatment, school standards and £60bn over ten years on home insulation and double glazing saving families £400 a year on bills. And he dismissed Boris Johnson as ""a showman with nothing left to show"" as he contrasted his values with those of the Prime Minister. Putting the Government on notice, he told the PM: ""Either get a grip or get out of the way and let us clear up this mess"". Mr Starmer's first conference address, billed as the most important of his political life, sought to define the future of Labour under his leadership. It ended a week in which he forced through rule changes to strengthen his own grip on the party and saw the departure of the last Corbynite in his shadow cabinet. The Labour leader faced down protesters chanting ""oh Jeremy Corbyn"" and calling for the national minimum wage to rise to £15. ""At this time on a Wednesday it's normally the Tories who are heckling me [at Prime Minister's Questions]. It doesn't bother me then, doesn't bother me now,"" he told them. After yet more heckles he said they had a choice between ""shouting slogans or changing lives"". To the anger of the Left, he promised to never again to go into an election ""with a manifesto that is not a serious plan for government"". In a frank admission of the party's failings under his predecessor, he admitted voters who abandoned Labour in 2019 thought it was ""unpatriotic or irresponsible"" . His summer tour round the country had shown him some people ""reluctantly chose the Tories because they didn't believe our promises were credible"". He told the voters: ""It will not take another election defeat for the Labour party to become an alternative government in which you can trust. ""My job as leader is not just to say thank you to the voters who stayed with us. It is to understand and persuade the voters who rejected us."" And he told his own party: ""If the (Tories) are so bad, what does it say about us? Because after all in 2019 we lost to them, and we lost badly. ""I know that hurts each and every one of you. So, let's get totally serious about this."" In his 90-minute address, Mr Starmer contrasted his own seriousness and competence in his former role as Director of Public Prosecutions with Boris Johnson's frivolity. ""I don't think Boris Johnson is a bad man. I think he is a trivial man. I think he's a showman with nothing left to show,"" he said. He said the PM assumed that he didn't need to stick to the same rules as everybody else - highlighting his defence of Dominic Cummings ' visit to Barnard Castle. Later, he joked: ""My dad was a toolmaker. Although in a way, so was Boris Johnson's!"" Mr Starmer, 59, opened up about his upbringing, including how he was the first member of his family to go to university. He became a lawyer and rose to become the Director of Public Prosecutions before being elected as an MP in 2015. John and Penny Clough, who he met while they campaigned tirelessly for justice for their murdered daughter Jane, struggled to contain their emotions as they watched his speech. The Labour leader credited them with teaching him ""how to keep your dignity under severe pressure"". Watched by his wife Victoria from the front row, Mr Starmer gave a deeply personal speech in which he described how his toolmaker father had given him respect for the dignity of work. He opened up about the death of his mum Josephine, describing the moment he saw four nurses rushing to save her life. ""The NHS that had been her livelihood became her lifeline,"" he said. Mr Starmer, the former shadow Brexit secretary who pushed for a second referendum which turned many voters away from Labour, tackled the thorny issue head-on. ""The economic inheritance from the Tories will be appalling: A botched Brexit followed by Covid has left a big hole,"" he said. ""The Government is learning that it is not enough to Get Brexit Done. You need a plan to Make Brexit Work."" He also reclaimed the mantle of patriotism with praise for NATO and the armed forces - but also for footballer Marcus Rashford who campaigned for free school meals and took the knee.",Real Mirror,872.0

The Labour leader is to put a revolution in education at the heart of his conference speech, to boost the futures of children. Mr Starmer will say in Brighton: ""Labour will launch the most ambitious school improvement plan ever."" He will vow to fix an education system battered by more than a decade of austerity as he puts the future of children at the heart of Labour's revolution With almost half of pupils leaving school without the qualifications that can give them a good start in life, the party leader is to pledge to recruit thousands of teachers to fill vacancies and skills gaps across the profession. Mr Starmer will on Wednesday set out his upbeat blueprint for government if he is voted into No10 at the next election, in the biggest speech if his career. Announcing Labour is ""back in business"", he is to present himself as a serious alternative to Boris Johnson, who has presided over a string of blunders, U-turns and excuses during the pandemic. It comes after a period of infighting in the party and the shock resignation of Shadow Employment Rights Secretary Andy McDonald. Asked on Tuesday what is most important to him, unity within the party or winning, Sir Keir said: ""Winning. Winning a general election. ""I didn't come into politics to vote over and over again in Parliament and lose, and then tweet about it. I came into politics to go into government to change millions of lives for the better."" Even before Covid struck, 200,000 primary age children in England were growing up in areas without a primary school rated good or outstanding. Mr Starmer will warn Britain faces being left behind unless it opens up opportunities for all young people. In his speech at the party's conference in Brighton, he will say: ""I want every parent in the country to be able to send their child to a great state school. On top of that, 40% of young people leave compulsory education without essential qualifications. ""What does that say about their future? We will not put up with that. ""That is why Labour will launch the most ambitious school improvement plan ever."" Ofsted will be reformed to focus on supporting struggling schools. And heads and teachers will get more ongoing development and leadership skills training. Mr Starmer said this week private schools would pay £1.7billion a year in tax to fund a learning revolution for state-educated children under Labour. The Government has committed extra funding for schools in England next year, but it will not reverse a cut in real terms school spending per pupil. And its school recovery tsar Sir Kevan Collins quit after Mr Johnson rejected his £15billion plans to help the education system recover from Covid. Labour insiders said the speech would be a forceful diagnosis of the state of the nation after more than a decade of disastrous Tory rule. Mr Starmer is keen to prove the party has changed since Jeremy Corbyn led it to election catastrophe in 2019. He will say: ""Too often in the history of this party our dream of the good society falls foul of the belief that we will not run a strong economy. ""But you don't get one without the other. And under my leadership we are committed to both. ""I can promise you that under my leadership Labour will be back in business."" And he will turn his gaze firmly out towards the country. Mr Starmer will highlight the fuel crisis and the rising cost of living as evidence the PM lacks competence and the Government is ""lost in the woods"". The fiercely private politician will give his most personal address yet, with wife Vicky watching from the front row, sharing previously unheard details of how his background shaped him. One Labour aide said: ""Keir's speech will be noticeably different from what you've heard from Labour in recent years. It will be more optimistic, more focused on the future. ""The speech will be a demonstration of the way the Labour party has changed. It will be a clear indication that Labour will never again go into an election with a manifesto that isn't a serious plan for government."" But Mr Starmer faces fury from the left for opposing a £15-an-hour minimum wage – a key reason Mr McDonald cited in his resignation. And after he quit he told the leader Labour was more divided than ever over the infighting. But Mr Starmer insisted Mr McDonald's ""wrong"". There was already rows over the suspension of Mr Corbyn from the party for refusing to apologise over accusations of anti-Semitism on his watch. Mr Starmer said it was up to the former leader as to whether he gets the Labour whip back as the ""ball is in his court"". He added: ""The position today is exactly as it was when we last spoke, which is an issue between Jeremy and the chief whip.",Real Mirror,876.0
386,Real,The Mirror,"Keir Starmer has tightened his grip on the Labour party but some fear he may struggle to make an emotional connection with voters - on Wednesday the former top lawyer faces the jury of public opinion When Keir Starmer was a top lawyer he specialised in judge-led cases rather than having to persuade a jury. It required him to use his fierce intellect and formidable grasp of detail. But it also meant he rarely had to use persuasion or passion to win over a dozen of his peers in court. One MP told the Mirror: ""He was always better at convincing the judge than the jury"". Some in Labour fear their party leader may struggle to make that same emotional connection with voters. His reputation as a competent, clever, decent human being is assured. But they worry that he lacks the political instinct to talk directly to the public in a way that makes them feel he really gets them. So his first conference speech as Labour leader on Wednesday will be the most important of his political career. After 18 months of being unable to get round the country, he finally has the chance, as one aide puts it, to ""hold the mike"" and talk directly to voters. His hour-long speech has been inspired by his summer tour through Blackpool, Swindon and Glasgow talking to people who had turned away from the party. While they told him they weren't yet ready to back Labour, they were now at least prepared to give him a hearing. In part, because the departure of Jeremy Corbyn as leader has helped detoxify the party. But in Labour's focus groups since then, some Tory voters from 2019 also admitted they were having ""serious doubts"" about the Government's competence. They felt that ""the shine is coming off Boris Johnson "", one of those in the room said. While they felt sorry for him after his brush with Covid last year they are now unimpressed by his handling of the pandemic. That dissatisfaction has now bubbled over into anger over the escalating cost of living crisis. Starmer's allies say he will be underlining that feeling by claiming the Tories are ""strong on slogans, weak on government"". ""These are serious times that require serious leadership,"" they say. Starmer's five days at the Brighton seaside may have helped the party turn the page on the Corbyn era for good. His aides say winning the battle over internal party rules and the departure of the last Corbynite standing from his shadow cabinet have tightened his grip. They revealed that he will not mention his predecessor by name in his speech - and has a quick response ready for any renditions of 'Oh, Jeremy Corbyn'. But it will be clear that when he is talking about competence he won't just be meaning Boris Johnson. And he will namecheck some of the successes of the previous Labour governments run by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. He will announce new policies that will show the direction of travel he intends to take the party in the run-up to the next election. He has also taken inspiration from the victory of a left-wing party in Germany this weekend - despite all the polls writing them off as outsiders. Starmer began writing his speech, which will be watched by his wife Vicky on the front row, on his family summer break in Dorset. Labour insiders say it will be his most personal to date - and will be even more revealing than he was on Piers Morgan's life stories as he tries to tell the public his story. He will walk onto the stage to music but while aides would not reveal which tune they did insist it will not be the New Labour hymn 'Things Can Only Get Better'. Instead of reading his speech from notes Gordon Brown-style, or memorising it and pacing around the stage like Ed Miliband, he will stand at a podium and be prompted by an autocue. On the eve of delivering his speech last night, before making the final tweaks, Starmer told the Mirror that he was not nervous. But his judge tomorrow will not be those watching him in the room. It will be the jury of public opinion.",Real Mirror,712.0

He would also launch a major recruitment drive for volunteer 'special' constables to increase the visibility of uniformed police.

388,Real,The Mirror,"Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said Labour will cut business tax for small firms as well as crack down on tax breaks for the wealthy to help ordinary workers Millions of small firms will face an immediate cut in business rates if Labour takes power at the next election - before they are scrapped completely a year later. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves will announce plans to shift the burden of business taxes from the high street, struggling in the wake of the pandemic, onto larger and online companies. In an interview with the Mirror, she said: ""It's unfair competition and that's why we want to reform that business rate system. ""It would be a levelling of the playing field so big business pays at least a global minimum on corporation tax and high street and small businesses and start ups see their burden of tax fall."" The plan would be paid for by a one-off Digital Services Tax of 12% for the first year, and a global minimum rate of corporation tax after that. Labour would also crack down on tax breaks for the wealthy, worth billions of pounds, to help fund policies for ordinary workers. Boris Johnson is already under pressure to drop his plans to cut Universal Credit from next month and not to hike National Insurance next year to clear the NHS backlog. The Government currently spends over £170bn a year on tax breaks, more than it spends on the health service, with many of them wasteful and inefficient. Ms Reeves said she would prioritise scrapping the 28% rate on bonuses for private equity bosses, raising £440m a year. ""The Government just needs to not go ahead with the things they're planning. Even if they got a pay-rise money is being taken out of their pockets and purses,"" she told the Mirror. ""There's plenty of people the Government could tax - but they never go to those people, they just go to ordinary working people.""

""Those people who do jobs without which the rest of society wouldn't be able to function. They're the foundations of our society. ""They're too often hidden from sight and under appreciated and undervalued, but they're absolutely essential. They keep the economy going."" Ms Reeves accused the PM of being ""incredibly complacent"" about the difficult winter ahead for families struggling to pay their bills. She suggested that many of the problems - driver shortages, empty supermarket shelves and hospitality businesses struggling to find staff - were as a result of Brexit. ""This Government were the Brexit cheerleaders-in-chief,"" she said. ""We've had five years since the electorate voted to leave the EU and the Government has no plan, they've lurched from one crisis to another with no plan of how to fix it."" The former Bank of England economist set out Labour's new fiscal rules at the weekend in an attempt to boost the party's battered reputation for economic credibility. She refused to say whether Labour would back pay increases for public sector workers until she had seen the books at next month's Budget. However, she said that the party had ""very much objected"" to the 1% payrise for NHS staff announced by Rishi Sunak and would look at the ""envelope"" of money available. The Labour MP batted away claims of splits over income tax after Keir Starmer claimed that ""nothing was off the table"" - just hours after she had said there were no plans to increase it. ""We are very much on the same page,"" she said. Business groups welcomed Labour's plans to replace business rates with a fairer system. The Federation of Small Businesses's Mike Cherry said: ""The shadow chancellor is right to propose concrete reform of a business rates tax which disproportionately burdens the small businesses and sole traders at the heart of local communities.""

But the fall-out is set to get worse after he admitted to reporters on the train to New York that Britain, the US and Australia are shutting the doors to their exclusive club. The three countries will work closely together on security, human rights and economic affairs but France will not be invited to the table.

England's players are concerned about Australia 's strict coronavirus protocols and there are particular issues surrounding whether or not their families will be able to join them in Australia. The Ashes is due to kick off in December with five matches played over the following two months around Australia, which has virtually closed its borders to foreign nationals. Mr Johnson told reporters: ""I raised it and he said he was going to do his best for the families.

The President and PM were looking to build bridges after the fall of Kabul during their historic meeting at the White House on Tuesday. Mr Johnson had insisted that Britain was ""first in line"" for an agreement after Donald Trump took office. But asked whether that was still the case, Mr Biden told reporters tonight: ""We're going to talk about trade a little bit today and we're gonna have to work that through."" Ahead of his arrival in Washington, the PM had already admitted the US President had ""a lot of fish to fry"" other than striking deals. Government insiders suggested Britain would look at other options including asking to join the the existing US-Mexico-Canada agreement instead. A diplomatic source said: ""There are a variety of different ways to do this. The question is whether the US administration is ready. ""The ball is in the US's court. It takes two to tango."" The PM was seeking to mend the rift with Mr Biden over the Northern Ireland border amid American fears the PM is putting peace in the province at risk. But Mr Biden said he feels ""very strongly"" that he does not want a change to the ""Irish accords"" resulting in ""a closed border"". He said: ""On the protocols I feel very strongly on those. We spent an enormous amount of time and effort, the United States, it was a major bipartisan effort made. ""And I would not at all like to see, nor I might add would many of my Republican colleagues like to see, a change in the Irish accords, the end result having a closed border in Ireland."" A trade deal with America was billed as one of the prizes of Brexit and Mr Johnson is under pressure to prove the biggest upheaval in British foreign policy in decades was worth it. As far back as 2016, then-President Barack Obama had cautioned Britain it would be ""at the back of the queue"" for an agreement. But Donald Trump was much keener to strike a trade deal with Britain than his successor, boasting that it would be ""fantastic and big"" once signed. Earlier, the PM had indicated that he did not expect to secure a free trade agreement with the US before the next election in 2024. He said he has ""plenty of reason to be optimistic"" about getting the FTA which was touted by Leave supporters as a major prize of leaving the EU. Mr Johnson, one of the architects of Vote Leave, raised the possibility that he could leave Downing Street without achieving a key ambition for the post-Brexit era. Asked if he would get the deal by 2024, the Prime Minister told Sky News: ""We will keep going with free trade deals around the world including in the United States. ""I have plenty of reason to be optimistic about that. But the Americans do negotiate very hard."" The UK currently has a deeper trading relationship with Canada and Mexico than it currently has with the US. Other options would be for the UK to agree a series of smaller sectoral deals or trade with America through an agreement operating with countries round the Pacific rim.

The Prime Minister said he doesn't ""want or expect"" to ban people from seeing their loved ones as he did last festive season. Mr Johnson faced fierce criticism last year after he ordered people to stay at home for Christmas as cases soared - just days after saying it would be ""inhuman"" to cancel festivities. The PM had come under fire for repeated last minute screeching U-turns during the first year of the Covid pandemic. On his plane to New York, he told reporters: ""We certainly don't want or expect to have to do anything like last Christmas... That is very much not the plan"". It comes after Health Secretary Sajid Javid insisted ministers are not expecting ""any more lockdowns"" and promised Christmas would not be cancelled this year. Experts believe that Covid booster jabs, which are being offered to the over-80s from this week, will be key to avoiding further restrictions later this winter. Vaccines chiefs have recommended that about 30m people, including the over-50s, frontline health and social care workers and those with underlying health conditions, should get one. Mr Johnson last week set out his new Covid winter plan which includes a toolkit of contingency measures if the virus begins to spiral out of control. Mandatory masks, vaccine passports and working from home could all be brought in to prevent another surge overwhelming hospitals. Cases appear to be levelling out however medics have warned that the NHS could face pressure from a combined flu and Covid crisis. The PM has ruled that another lockdown would be a final resort if all other restrictions failed to curb any surge. Boris Johnson later insisted ""Christmas is on"" as he claimed that Brits will not struggle this winter amid fears a cost of living crisis. He faced fierce criticism last Christmas after he ordered people to stay at home as cases soared - just days after saying it would be ""inhuman"" to cancel festivities. Asked if he accepted people will struggle this winter, the Prime Minister told ITN: ""No, because I think this is a short-term problem caused by the energy problems, the spikes in gas prices, and like many of the other supply issues we are seeing including food are caused by the world economy waking up after a long time in this suspended animation caused by Covid."" He added: ""We will do whatever we can to address the supply issues but this is a short-term problem.""

395,Real,The Mirror,"Boris Johnson pledged to 'fix' the energy crisis rocking Britain's domestic politics as it risked overshadowing his trip to New York Downing Street has insisted there will be no return to a 1970s style three-day working week as the gas crisis raised fears of a difficult winter. Boris Johnson has pledged to ""fix"" the energy price crisis to reassure people their lights would not go out and they would still be able to heat their homes. The Prime Minister said the Government was ""working flat out"" with energy companies to guarantee supply. Wholesale prices for gas have surged 250% since January with a 70% rise since August alone leading to calls from the industry for more support. It has prompted fears that people may struggle to heat and light their homes while firms which are heavily reliant on energy could be forced to cut their working days. But Mr Johnson's official spokesman said there was ""no question of returning to that point"" as security of energy supply in the UK was solid. He said: ""Of course it's important for the public to be reassured that there's no question of returning to that point thanks to the security of our supply which has been proven both at the height of a global pandemic and at other times as well."" The PM's spokesman insisted that no taxpayers' cash would be used to prop up failing energy businesses after calls for more support for the industry. He added: ""We will obviously want to support the sector recognising they are facing significant challenges. ""We are not going to use taxpayers money to prop up failing businesses. Appearing at the United Nations summit, Mr Johnson said Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was working with energy companies ""doing everything we can to help them"". He told reporters: ""We are working hard to find a way through, and to keep a steady supply of gas. ""It's like when you see a serious frost in your house and when it thaws it's when you see all the problems. ""The global economy is thawing very rapidly and you're seeing problems in supply chains, very strong demand for gas around the world, it's producing this phenomenon causing this. ""We will fix it. Earlier, Mr Kwarteng told MPs there was ""absolutely no question of the lights going out"" this winter amid escalating energy prices. After talks holding crisis talks with the industry on Monday, he claimed it was ""alarmist"" to suggest people would not be able to heat their homes as the UK had ""sufficient capacity"" to meet demand. The Business Secretary insisted the Government will ""not be bailing out failed companies"" as a result of the crisis and that the energy cap will ""remain in place"" to protect consumers from ""sudden"" price increases. He told MPs: ""We have sufficient capacity, and more than sufficient capacity, to meet demand and we do not expect supply emergencies to occur this winter ""There is absolutely no question of the lights going out or people being unable to heat their homes.

The Prime Minister claimed that Insulate Britain was failing to ""do any favours"" towards their aim of tackling carbon emissions. The group has sparked anger by repeatedly blocking the M25 orbital motorway around London last week - with numerous demonstrators arrested on Friday. Home Secretary Priti Patel condemned the ""guerrilla tactics"" of the protestors as ""selfish"" as she said they detracted from their calls for more action on insulating houses. Mr Johnson, in New York on Monday to argue for more action to tackle climate change at the United Nations, suggested police were right to move demonstrators on. He said that tactics used by Insulate Britain, an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion climate change campaign, were counterproductive as they disrupted peoples' lives. Asked about the group's direct action, Mr Johnson said: ""No, I don't think these people do any favours to their cause. ""think that what they do is detract from a very important moral mission that is widely shared by the people of this country."" The PM defended the police for stepping in to break up protests that were disrupting the live of everyday Brits. ""They are taking powers to be able to move protestors when they are threatening critical national infrastructure, when they are threatening to do serious economic damage and i think that is entirely right."" However, Green MP Caroline Lucas said her party believes non-violent direct action is ""legitimate when other forms of trying to raise issues with the Government have failed"". It comes after the Transport Secretary said protests blocking the M25 are ""illegal"" and police must act more quickly to stop them. Insulate Britain protesters targeted the M25 for a fourth time in little more than a week on Monday, blocking slip roads by gluing themselves to the carriageway and pouring paint on to the roads as part of their campaign to improve home insulation. The group said many of the people involved in Monday's protests were involved in three similar demonstrations last week across junctions in Kent, Essex and Surrey. Police have come under pressure from the Government to clamp down on the protests and limit disruption while one minister said the protests are ""irresponsible"" and ""dangerous"". Grant Shapps told the PA news agency: ""I think it's irresponsible, I think it's dangerous. ""It's completely counterproductive as well because they're actually creating the pollution they want to get rid of by having cars standing still, so there's no justification for that kind of action. ""I call on them to stop and the police to intervene."" Asked if he wants the police to take a more robust approach to the demonstrations, Mr Shapps said: ""The police will have to work out their approach and tactics, but it's not right for our roads to be blocked for illegal protests like this to take place, and for it to happen repetitively. ""I've no doubt at all the police will want to learn from their experience and make sure they're able to step in more quickly and efficiently.""",Real Mirror,554.0

The Prime Minister will sit down with the multi-billionaire in New York on Monday ahead of meetings on climate change at the United Nations and with Joe Biden at the White House. Mr Bezos, one of the richest men in the world, has stepped back from running Amazon to focus on climate change projects, but the UK wants his business to do more. The online giant's climate footprint is rising as a result of an increase in deliveries and packaging and it is struggling to cut down on pollution. The Government also wants big tech firms like Amazon to pay more tax in the UK where online sales have soared during the pandemic. Ahead of the talks, the PM's official spokesman said: ""You can expect the PM to raise this important issue. ""As you know we have been an advocate for an international solution to the tax challenges posed by the digitalisation of the economy."" He added: ""We fully recognise that while it is one of the largest companies in the world, Amazon also has a role in addressing issues of climate change and bio-diversity"". The online shopping giant's latest financial results show it paid £492m in direct taxation in the UK as its sales rose 50% during the Covid pandemic. But Amazon and other tech firms, which pay tax on profits rather than sales, have come under growing pressure to make a fairer contribution to British coffers. That figure includes employer's national insurance, business rates, stamp duty and corporation tax. But its key UK business paid just £3.8m more corporation tax last year than in 2019, even as sales grew to £1.89 billion. Ministers have been urged by the unions to ""get a grip"" on the firm which has been accused of ""profiteering"" on the backs of workers and criticised over its environmental impact. Mr Johnson sits down with President Biden at the White House on Tuesday to try to build bridges after the chaotic withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.

In Washington he will meet a series of Congressional leaders including Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, leading Republican Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. He will attempt to sooth their nerves over his post-Brexit plans for the Northern Ireland border which they fear could undermine the fragile peace process.

Downing Street fears that global efforts could fall short ahead of the key COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November which it hopes will promote Britain as a global leader. Mr Johnson will kick off his visit to the United Nations general assembly in New York with a round table of world leaders on climate change co-hosted by the UN Secretary General. He will also hold a series of face-to-face meetings including with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a climate denier who has permitted destruction of the Amazon rainforest.

Ahead of the Paris Agreement, wealthy countries promised to give $100bn a year to help developing countries cut emissions, minimise impacts of climate change and adapt economies. But while green issues have become a major focus, the developed nations have failed to reach the target, with just $80bn raised last year. At the G7 Summit in June, another $4bn a year was pledged in additional finance but critics have warned it is nowhere near enough.

""I will be pushing them to take concrete action on coal, climate, cars and trees so we can make a success of COP26 and keep our climate goals within reach."" But the PM's more immediate diplomatic test will be smoothing over divisions with the US on a slew of issues including Afghanistan, Northern Ireland and coronavirus restrictions. He is expected to raise the US travel ban with the President which has been imposed on almost all Brits since last year, while US tourists are now allowed to the UK. The two countries have suffered a rocky period in relations since Mr Biden took office in January - despite smiling together for the cameras at the G7 summit in Cornwall. Government insiders claim the PM felt ""let down"" by the President's refusal to extend the departure date from Afghanistan after the fall of Kabul to get more people out. The Foreign Office was forced to deny Pentagon claims that British officials pushed US counterparts to keep a gate open at Kabul airport before a deadly bomb attack. Mr Johnson will also try to persuade the US administration that he is not putting peace in Northern Ireland at risk by threatening to suspend Brexit agreements with the European Union. He has been warned by key Democrats not to ""destroy"" the peace process if he wants to get a trade deal with the US - with the breakdown in talks branded ""problematic"". Mr Johnson regards a trade deal with the US as a big Brexit prize but senior Government insiders admit it is proving difficult. However, Britain and the US this week struck a security pact with Australia which includes the US providing nuclear-powered submarines, a show of strength aimed at China.

""For a Government which has extolled the importance of personal responsibility to show so little personal responsibility themselves is quite shocking. ""Ministers should be leading by example.

It could include vaccine passports being demanded at some indoor venues. A full national lockdown has not been ruled out. Plan A includes booster jabs and advice on meeting indoors and wearing face masks. Docs warn ministers are in danger of being too slow, saying: ""They speak of a Plan B... they should open their eyes and realise now is the time to act."" A booster jab rollout for the over 50s and vulnerable people will be the first line of defence against another surge in Covid infections. The Government intends to stick with its Plan A unless the NHS is again on the brink of collapse. Boris Johnson, who today unveiled his Plan B to avoid another devastating winter, is under pressure to go ""earlier and harder"" with restrictions if cases spike. Plan B may also mean compulsory face masks and vaccine passports being needed at certain venues. While people in England could be asked to work from home again. A full national lockdown is not ruled out, though it is a last resort for the Prime Minister who would need the backing of MPs for such a move. Plan A includes measures – such as wearing face coverings, opening windows and social distancing in crowded indoor spaces – that would only be voluntary. The Prime Minister was accused of ""more chaos and confusion"" after being unable to say exactly what criteria would trigger Plan B. However, the Government is understood to be keeping a close eye on data including new variants and the rate of hospitalisations. The chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance warned that if Plan B was required ministers must act swiftly and not wait for numbers to get out of control. He said: ""When you make a move, you have to go earlier than you think you want to, you have to go harder than you think you want to and you have need to make sure you have got the right geographical coverage. ""So, if this goes in the wrong direction and cases go up, followed by hospitalisations, it's important that the measures are put in place early enough and they are significant enough."" Sir Patrick added if the country had gone into last winter – before jabs were available – with the current level of restrictions, cases would have gone through the roof. Mr Johnson urged the five million people who have not yet taken up the offer of a vaccine to get the jab to help avoid tougher restrictions this winter. At a Downing Street briefing, the PM added the jabs rollout meant the UK could remain ""one of the most free  societies"" in Europe with only limited measures to keep the disease in check. Booster vaccines will be offered from next week to around 32 million people who are aged 50 and over or who are clinically extremely vulnerable. The first recipients will be care home residents and staff, over-80s and frontline health and social care workers. Ministers think the third jab will help ensure the NHS is not overwhelmed. But officials are concerned about a spike hitting the health service – already under pressure from staff shortages and the backlog due to Covid – at the same time as a flu outbreak. Last autumn, there were about 1,000 Covid patients in hospital, but now there are over 8,000. Experts fear Covid hospitalisations in England may rise to 6,000 per day in the coming weeks – which would be higher than the January peak. The SPI-M sub-group, part of the Government's SAGE group of scientific advisers, said infection rates would only have to rise slightly to pile pressure on the NHS. They suggested measures such as working from home and mask wearing should be reintroduced while hospital levels are still relatively low. It comes as Covid cases rose by 26,628 and there were a further 185 deaths. Doctors are worried about Mr Johnson's plans. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association, said: ""The Government is advising the public to meet outdoors where possible, and to wear masks in crowded indoor spaces. They clearly believe these measures make a difference, yet are failing to act by making these a requirement. We've had this kind of double-speak before, which has resulted in action not being taken until it is too late."" He added: ""While ministers speak of a Plan B – although on what basis is unclear – they should open their eyes and realise that now is the time to act. ""If left too late, we could find ourselves in a position where the NHS is dangerously overwhelmed.""

401,Real,The Mirror,"Working from home and compulsory face-masks are among the options being looked at by the government as the PM prepares to set out his plan to get the country through coronavirus over the autumn and winter Boris Johnson is ""dead set"" on avoiding further lockdown as he prepares to set out his plan to get the country through coronavirus over the autumn and winter. The Prime Minister will today set out a ""toolbox"" of options including working from home and compulsory face-masks to help avoid another lockdown. Mr Johnson will announce the plan - first revealed by the Mirror in July - at Downing Street where he will tell the nation how they need to learn to live with the virus. He will highlight how the Government regards vaccinations as the key defence against soaring Covid infections over the coming months. The PM said: ""The pandemic is far from over, but thanks to our phenomenal vaccine programme, new treatments and testing we are able to live with the virus without significant restrictions on our freedoms. ""I will set out a clear plan for the autumn and winter, when the virus has a natural advantage, to protect the gains we have made."" Government insiders stressed that Mr Johnson's plans were aimed at preventing another lockdown. One said: ""This is the new normal. We need to learn to live with Covid. ""The vaccines are a wall of defence. The autumn and the winter do offer some uncertainty, but the Prime Minister is dead set against another lockdown."" Mr Johnson is expected to confirm that plans for vaccine passports for nightclubs and other large crowd venues have been shelved. The travel traffic lights system is also expected to be scrapped and PCR tests will no longer be required for fully vaccinated travellers. There will also be a major advertising campaign in a bid to do everything possible to avoid a winter shutdown across England. But while many powers to shut down venues under the Coronavirus Act will be rescinded, the core power to impose a lockdown will remain in place. Covid infection rates are higher than at this stage last year - but the PM is confident that jabs will keep hospitalisation and death rates down as the country goes into winter. In England, the number of deaths and hospitalisations has remained relatively stable over the last month, thanks to the vaccines roll-out scheme. The Government will today set out its the plans for booster vaccinations, which will be given to the most vulnerable people first. Face masks are currently not forced by law in any indoor spaces though they are ""expected and recommended"" in crowded places like public transport, and they are a condition of carriage on London Tubes and buses and the Manchester tram. While the Prime Minister will probably stop short of bringing back compulsory masks, he could threaten for them to make a return if cases surge later in the winter. The Government is aware that masks have helped in stopping airborne transmission of the virus and some businesses - including big supermarkets - still request shoppers wear them. Yet most Tory MPs are not bothering to follow the existing guidance on wearing a mask in the Commons chamber. The wearing of masks has become a symbolic dividing line between lockdown sceptics and those who are more cautious about spreading the disease. Yet scientists are clear that face-masks play an important role in limiting infections and protecting other people. The PM has vowed to use a mass vaccine booster programme as ""our first line of defence"" over the autumn and winter months. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has already given advice to No 10 with the Prime Minister expected to announce today they have given boosters the green light. The third doses are set to be rolled out to all over-50s and vulnerable people, starting with the oldest, most vulnerable and NHS workers. Scientists believe that the ongoing vaccine roll-out is the single best way to tackle rising infections. All children aged 12 and over will now be offered one dose of the Pfizer vaccine to help prevent schools chaos over winter. Health chiefs acknowledge concerns that no jab is entirely without risk, but are clear that jabbing kids will help avoid further disruption to their schooling, as well as keeping them safe. The Government is not currently recommending that people who can work from home, do work from home, and most employers have welcomed back staff at least some of the time. For now, ministers are leaving it up to employers to make the decision after consulting workers. While this is unlikely to change today, instructing people to work from home once again could be threatened as a future move if case rates start to creep up. The move is part of the package that helped drive down cases previously as it takes people off public transport and prevents them from mixing with colleagues. Despite the removal of Covid restrictions in England, businesses still have a legal duty to manage risks to those affected by their business and carry out health-and-safety risk assessments.",Real Mirror,858.0
402,Real,The Mirror,"Medical chiefs will unveil the final details of the UK's booster vaccine rollout this autumn and winter today, and Boris Johnson will give a press conference this afternoon Boris Johnson is poised to announce all over-50s will be offered a Covid booster vaccine before Christmas. The UK's mass booster programme will be formally confirmed by medical chiefs today, and Health Secretary Sajid Javid will give a statement in the House of Commons. The Prime Minister will then host a press conference this afternoon with Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty and Chief Scientific Advisor Sir Patrick Vallance. Reports suggest the booster programme will follow a similar pattern to the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation's (JCVI) interim advice from June. Under that advice, stage one would give boosters to immunosuppressed and extremely vulnerable over-16s; care home residents; frontline health and care workers; and all over-70s. Stage two would give them to all over-50s, plus all over-16s in a flu or Covid risk group, and any adults who share their home with an immunosuppressed person. It comes hours after medical chiefs gave the green light to vaccinating children aged 12 to 15, amid fears more school disruptions from Covid threaten the education and mental health of pupils who have already missed lessons. They warned the impact on kids, especially from deprived areas, justified the rollout of a single Pfizer jab to all secondaries from next week and said it would reduce outbreaks. NHS teams are now on standby to administer vaccines in pop-up cabins at playgrounds, gyms and assembly halls, to inoculate three million more children, after Sajid Javid accepted the advice of the UK's four chief medical officers. But the Health Secretary faced criticism for not launching the jabs sooner, with education chiefs fearing it may be too late to prevent Covid spikes in the autumn and winter. Booster jabs for adults are also expected to be confirmed today after Boris Johnson yesterday let slip vaccine regulators have approved them. Parents will be asked to give their consent before their child is vaccinated, although kids are legally allowed to decide for themselves if they are deemed competent. It comes just 10 days after a separate government advisory body, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, decided against recommending jabs for over-12s, saying the benefits for healthy children were marginal as Covid is very low risk for most. There are now fears the JCVI and CMO discussions have made the situation unclear and may fuel vaccine hesitancy in parents. England's CMO Professor Chris Whitty said it had been a ""difficult decision"" but that they would not be recommending the vaccinations ""unless we felt that benefit exceeded risk"". He added: ""The effects of disrupted education, or uncertainty, on mental health are well recognised. There can be lifelong effects on health if extended disruption to education leads to reduced life chances. ""Whilst full closures of schools due to lockdowns is much less likely to be necessary in the next stages of the epidemic, UK CMOs expect it to continue to be prolonged and unpredictable. ""Local surges of infection, including in schools, should be anticipated for some time. Where they occur, they are likely to be disruptive."" Prof Whitty said: ""What we're not trying to do is say to children 'you must, must, must, must, must' but what we're saying is that we think on balance the benefits, both at an individual level and in terms of wider indirect benefits to education and public health, are in favour."" He also revealed there were ""no plans at the moment"" to extend the vaccines rollout to primary school age children. The JCVI's Professor Wei Shen Lim insisted there was ""no conflict"" between their advice and that from health chiefs. Mr Javid said last night: ""I have accepted the recommendation from the chief medical officers to expand vaccination to those aged 12 to 15, protecting young people from catching Covid 19, reducing transmission in schools and keeping pupils in the classroom. ""Our outstanding NHS stands ready to move forward with rolling out the vaccine to this group with the same sense of urgency we've had at every point in our vaccination programme."" Teachers' leaders welcomed the decision but said it should have been taken earlier with children vaccinated over the summer. Dr Mary Bousted of the National Education Union said: ""While we recognise that a decision on vaccinating children needed careful evidential judgment, it would have been better if a decision could have been made earlier during the summer holidays. ""It will be well into the autumn before the impact of the vaccination programme will be felt."" Children in the US are already having vaccinations against Covid. Clinical evidence shows that a single dose of Pfizer cuts the risk of catching the Delta variant 55%, cuts transmission, and prevents most severe illness and death. The plan to offer younger secondary school children jabs has been fraught with difficulty because the virus generally affects children less severely than adults. The medicines safety regulator's Dr June Raine said the side-effects for 12 to  15-year-olds being vaccinated were mild. Scientists have warned children can also suffer heart issues as a result of getting Covid, and seem more susceptible to Long Covid.",Real Mirror,870.0
403,Real,The Mirror,"PM reveals £36billion tax plan to fix the NHS and social care but critics say it falls far short of what's needed for broken system as struggling workers to be hit hardest in funding plan Boris Johnson has been accused of ""missing a huge opportunity"" after he announced a 10% tax hike to tackle the social care crisis. The Prime Minister confirmed the manifesto-busting National Insurance increase would raise £36billion to clear the NHS Covid backlog and for his long-promised reforms to the crippled care sector. But care providers and families were disappointed that just £5.4bn of it will go on social care in England with the rest going to the NHS. Mr Johnson broke a personal manifesto guarantee not to raise taxes and another pledge by sus-pending the ""triple lock"" promise to raise pensions in line with inflation, the average wage increase or 2.5%. He accepted breaking a manifesto pledge, but said the pandemic ""was in no one's manifesto"". Sir Andrew Dilnot, architect of the original care reform plans, said the PM might need to raise taxes again after the three years. ""The Government may find that it needs to raise more money or borrow more in three or four years' time than it is for the delivery of those social care promises,"" he said. After visiting a care home in Stepney Green, East London, the PM announced the NI rate will rise from 12% to 13.25% from next April, an increase of 10.4% in payments for someone earning £30,000. It will then become a ""health and social care levy"" on earnings from 2023, calculated the same way as NI and appearing on payslips. The plans, which Tory MPs have criticised, cap the maximum individuals will spend on their care at £86,000 but not until October 2023. Anybody with assets of less than £20,000 will have their care costs fully covered by the state, while those with less than £100,000 will be subsidised. Labour leader Keir Starmer, who revealed his sister was a care worker, described the proposals as a ""sticking plaster over gaping wounds"" in the system. Mr Starmer branded it a ""tax rise on young people, supermarket workers and nurses"", adding: ""Read my lips: the Tories can never again claim to be the party of low tax."" Critics warned the tax hike, which will affect all Britons who earn over £9,568 a year, will disproportionately hit the young and low-paid. Taxes on share dividends will also rise by 1.25 percentage points. A YouGov poll found voters were split in their views on the hike, with 44% supporting the move, while 43% were opposed. The Government also appeared to drop another vow that nobody requiring care would need to sell their home. Health Secretary Sajid Javid could only say people would now have ""complete confidence"" in the maximum they would pay. Mr Johnson stood in Downing Street two years ago claiming he already had a plan to ""fix"" the crisis. But yesterday's announcement means less than £1 in £6 of the total sum raised will go on social care. It leaves just £2.5bn – just over £800m a year – to tackle the staffing crisis and for desperately needed reform. Government sources claimed there could be more cash for social care as the autumn Budget on October 27. But Mr Javid was not even able to say when social care would get more of the extra cash. ""I don't want to say that after three years it will be exactly this split,"" he said. Mike Padgham, chairman of the Independent Care Group, said it was a ""huge opportunity missed"" for once-in-a-generation reform. He said the sum promised ""isn't going to touch the crisis"" in a sector facing 120,000 vacancies and care providers struggling to cover shifts. He said: ""It is too little and, it looks like being, too late."" Richard Kramer, of disability charity Sense, said: ""Once again, the social care system is treated as the 'Cinderella' service to the NHS."" Prof Martin Green, chief executive of Care England, said: ""We've got to find a way in which this process is speeded up, because the crisis in social care is happening now."" Health think-tank the Nuffield Trust said the ""broken"" sector would be feeling ""short-changed and bitterly disappointed"". Unison general secretary Christina McAnea, who represents thousands of care workers, said the PM's focus on funding was a ""cart-before-the-horse approach"". She said: ""A detailed plan is needed first to mend and future-proof a sector broken by years of neglect."" Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg announced that MPs will get a vote on the plans today, giving them just 24 hours to examine the detail after two years of delay. Tory former Cabinet minister Damian Green demanded more direct cash for social care now. ""My fear is... there will never come a point where there is enough money in this fund to be transferred to social care that needs it now,"" he said. ""You can't spend the same pound twice.""

404,Real,The Mirror,"Poorer children need targeted help to recover from pandemic disruption, a thinktank warns, as a quarter of parents think it will take their child a year to catch up Two in five pupils failed to meet the Government's minimum guidelines for learning time during Covid school closures, a damning report has found. Schools could face challenges as pupils return this month with a quarter of parents believing it will take their child at least a year to catch up. The Institute for Fiscal Studies called for catch-up policies to be targeted at poorer pupils to close widening educational inequalities. Economist Angus Phimister, an author of the report, said: ""Catch-up policies need to be carefully designed to be taken up by poorer pupils if they are to have any chance of putting a dent in the educational inequalities that have grown so much wider during the pandemic."" Limited support and unequal provision for self-isolating students during the autumn term in 2020 - when schools were open but disrupted - disrupted efforts to address lost learning. Poorer families were more likely to be offered online classes by their schools, and to have the technology at home to access them, during the second period of school closures compared with the first lockdown. But overall around 40% of children did not meet the Government's expected minimum daily amount of time spent on remote learning even in the second round of school closures, according to the IFS report. After a year of Covid-related disruption, 25% of parents think their child will take at least a school year to catch up on lost learning and 7% think that their child will never catch up. While the majority of parents support tutoring to help children, the poorest families were the least likely to accept an offer of catch-up sessions. Among the poorest fifth of families, 36% of pupils had been offered tutoring by March 2021, but nearly a third of these chose not to take it up - by contrast, while a similar share of those in the most affluent families had been offered tutoring, only one in seven of them refused. During the autumn term - when schools were open - poorer pupils spent longer in self-isolation and had less access to school provisions when doing so, the report suggests. While 43% of secondary school pupils in the richest fifth of families had access to online classes while self-isolating, just 35% of their peers in the most disadvantaged homes had access to online lessons. In June, the DfE announced an additional £1.4 billion of funding, on top of the £1.7 billion already pledged for catch-up, to help pupils in England make up for lost learning. But the Government's own catch-up tsar Sir Kevan Collins, who quit after Boris Johnson rejected his £15bn catch-up plan, said the DFE recovery plan was ""feeble"" and did not come close to meeting the needs of pupils whose education had been thrown into chaos. Shadow education secretary Kate Green said: ""The Conservatives have treated children as an afterthought throughout the pandemic and their chaotic, last-minute response in schools failed children at every turn. ""Ministers left thousands of children without the ability to learn, with months of school being missed before even the first laptops were sent out. The priority must now be preventing further disruption in school and helping children bounce back."" A DfE spokesperson said: ""The Government acted swiftly to minimise the impact on children's education and wellbeing and help keep pupils in face-to-face education as much as possible.""",Real Mirror,589.0
405,Real,The Mirror,"The footballer said Wembley stadium could be filled 27 times over with the 2.5 million children in the UK that are struggling to know where their next meal is coming from England footballer Marcus Rashford is launching a major new campaign to tackle worsening food poverty ahead of the autumn Budget. The Manchester United star and food campaigner, who has twice forced the Government into U-turns over free school meals, is urging the public to write to their MPs. He warned that Wembley stadium could be filled 27 times over with the 2.5 million children in the UK that are struggling to know where their next meal is coming from. And he revealed new figures which show that ""devastatingly"" child food poverty is getting worse, rather than better. Rashford supports three major recommendations in the recent National Food Strategy, which was commissioned by Boris Johnson, but then dismissed by the Government. These are expanding free school eligibility to more vulnerable children, providing long-term funding for holiday programmes and boosting 'healthy start' support for pregnant women and children under five. Data from The Food Foundation shows that more households with children are experiencing food insecurity than in the first wave of the pandemic. A survey of 6,490 UK households found that 15% have experienced food insecurity in the past six months - levels that are approximately 27% higher than before the pandemic Rashford called for the Government to prioritise tackling food poverty in the Autumn Spending Review, saying he would be writing to his MP about the issue - and encouraged others to do the same. ""Whilst we've come a long way in the last 20 months, placing the issue of child food poverty at the forefront, devastatingly, the issue is getting worse not better,"" he said. ""The entire nation got behind the national team this Summer so let's put these figures in football terms: You can fill 27 Wembley stadiums with the 2.5 million children that are struggling to know where their next meal might be coming from today. ""What is it going to take for these children to be prioritised? Instead of removing support through social security, we should be focusing efforts on developing a sustainable long-term roadmap out of this child hunger pandemic. ""It will take many of us to stand together on this, and show we care about reaching those most in need in our communities."" Anna Taylor, of The Food Foundation, said: ""It's extremely distressing that now even more children lack a secure, nutritious diet compared with last year. ""Despite a sense of 'normality' returning, this is no time for complacency - we can't sit back and allow this damage to our children's health, learning and life chances, not to mention the heavy burden it bears on our NHS. ""We know children from deprived backgrounds have higher obesity rates, worse levels of diabetes, more tooth decay and even impaired height development compared with their wealthier peers. ""This will only get worse if left unaddressed and entrench inequalities deeper. So, today, we are asking Government to act appropriately to protect our youngest citizens."" Rashford waged a high-profile campaign last year to persuade the Government to provide free meals to vulnerable youngsters in England throughout the school holidays during the coronavirus pandemic, forcing the Prime Minister into a U-turn. The 23-year-old also became the youngest person to top the Sunday Times Giving List by raising £20 million in donations from supermarkets for groups tackling child poverty.

406,Real,The Mirror,"Keir Starmer told the Mirror the PM's controversial bid for an NI increase would hit young people, businesses and low earners Keir Starmer has ruled out Labour backing a controversial National Insurance rise to help fix the social care crisis. Boris Johnson is preparing to announce a manifesto-busting hike of 1.25% this week to raise around £10bn a year for social care and the NHS. Lifetime contributions on care are expected to be capped at about £80,000. The Prime Minister is planning to argue that the increase is vital to save the NHS but ministers, Government aides and Tory MPs are threatening open revolt over the plan. Critics argue that increasing NI to cover reforms will disproportionately affect younger and lower income workers, while pensioners will not pay extra. Some ministers are also nervous about breaking another Tory manifesto pledge by pushing ahead with the proposal, even if the PM focuses on tackling the NHS backlog. Mr Starmer's opposition to a NI hike comes as a blow to Mr Johnson's hopes of getting his social care plans through the Commons, even with his 82 majority. In an interview with the Mirror as MPs return to Westminster, Mr Starmer said: ""We do need more investment in the NHS and social care but National Insurance, this way of doing it, simply hits low earners, it hits young people and it hits businesses. ""We don't agree that is the appropriate way to do it. Do we accept that we need more investment? Yes we do. Do we accept that NI is the right way to do it? No we don't. ""But we will look at what they put forward because after eleven years of neglect we do need a solution."" It is almost two years since Mr Johnson stood outside Downing Street and insisted he had a ""clear plan"" to give people dignity and security in old age. Yet despite repeated promises of a plan since then his ministers have failed to provide any detail of his proposal to prop up the crippled sector. Government insiders claimed that No 10 and the Treasury were still at loggerheads over the exact details of the policy - and how it would be split between NHS and social care - even though it is expected to be unveiled on Tuesday. Mr Starmer faces pressure from the unions and within his own party to commit to taxing the wealthy to pay for the necessary reform - with an increase in capital gains tax one option. He told the Mirror it was ""inevitable"" that taxes would have to rise to help solve the social care crisis and hinted he might be prepared to accept that over-65s should contribute. He insisted: ""We need a fair way to raise the money that is needed."" The Labour leader did not rule out an increase to CGT but said no decision would be reached until the party drew up its next manifesto. But Shadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy went further, suggesting it was ""absolutely right"" that those with broader shoulders take more of the burden. Senior Tories have branded the proposal ""idiotic"", with one Cabinet member declaring it was ""morally, economically and politically wrong"" as it would break a personal pledge from the PM. Tory ex-Chancellor Philip Hammond, who was forced to U-turn on previous attempts to put up NI, warned the move would provoke a ""very significant backlash"". Ex-PM Sir John Major warned against the ""regressive"" move targeting workers and employers - and called for an increase in general taxation instead. Dominic Cummings, formerly the PM's top aide, tweeted: ""Every Tory MP stood on a manifesto promise NOT to put up income tax/NI. ""The PM personally guaranteed it. If you vote to break your promise you will hear 'you're a LIAR... ALL THE SAME' for years."" Around 1.5m elderly people do not get the help they need. Many are forced to depend on under-paid and over-stretched carers working for cash-strapped firms as councils make cuts.

But the Labour leader stopped short of promising to reverse the Tory cut if Labour ever gets to power. The party would replace UC with a ""fairer"" system that altered the existing taper so workers could keep more of the money they earned. He signalled his plan would be more generous: ""We want to make sure people are better off, not worse off. We would want people to have more money in their pockets"".

Scientists on the JCVI have claimed that the risk for children is very low from the virus and so they do not need to have the vaccine. But ministers have argued that rolling out the jab would result in less disruption at schools and also lower the risk of youngsters passing the virus to older people. Mr Starmer said he hoped there would no need for more Covid restrictions this winter but that Labour, which has backed the Government on lockdown, would consider any proposals in a ""pragmatic"" way.

Sharon Graham, who won a surprise victory in the Unite general secretary race last week, told the Mirror that she has no plans to continue writing ""blank cheques"" for the party. Unite is Labour's biggest donor, giving the party roughly £16m since January 2017, and any reduction in funds would be a big blow. But she claimed it was a ""red herring"" to suggest that Unite would formally disaffiliate from Labour as it was not what her 1.4 million members wanted. In an interview with the Mirror, she insisted her focus would be on putting Unite ""back on course"" to defending members, rather than weighing into politics. However, she warned that Labour would have to do more for workers as the country comes out of the pandemic if it wanted more funding. ""For me, they're not in the right space. It's not about the leadership, it's about what they're speaking about, the core issues - fire and rehire, investment,"" she said. ""I want to hear them holding the Government to account on those issues. I'm not hearing enough of that. I'm hearing soundbites, but the problem is it's white noise.""

She wants Unite to ""get back to what it says on the trade union tin - jobs, pay, conditions"" and put the interests of members first. ""There isn't going to be a saviour coming from the political arena that is going to deal with the issues facing members. The unions have to do that,"" she said. ""I like my heroes to be collective.

In particular, she has been criticised for a strategy drawn up by to target the adult family of business chiefs during industrial disputes. She defended the approach, which involved detailed research on the companies finances, as ""more brain than brawn"" . ""The idea that leverage is about waving flags outside somebody's house or suddenly involving family is nonsense,"" she said. ""The only time family members' interests are looked at is if they're part of the organisation"". She was unapologetic about previously signalling that unions should be ready to break the law in disputes. ""When we talk about stepping outside the law it's always really around the strike action legislation,"" she said. ""The idea that fire and rehire is legal is abhorrent to me. What do they expect us to do - put a press release out saying we don't like it? ""I want employers to do well because I want them to pay well, but where they overstep the line then I will absolutely defend members."" Her first industrial dispute was as a 17-year-old and she realised that being on the right side of the argument wasn't always enough. ""You think well how am I going to make that happen?

In an open letter to the PM, the organisations write: ""Imposing what is effectively the biggest overnight cut to the basic rate of social security since World War II will pile unnecessary financial pressure on around 5.5 million families, both in and out of work. ""We are at risk of repeating the same mistakes that were made after the last economic crisis, where our country's recovery was too often not felt by people on the lowest incomes. ""The erosion of social security support was one of the main drivers of the rise in in-work and child poverty, and contributed to a soaring need for food banks, rising debt and worsening health inequalities."" Dr Coffey claimed that the time was right to focus on supporting people back into work - but most people who will be affected by the cut are already in work. The signatories told the PM: ""We are rapidly approaching a national crossroads which will reveal the true depth of the Government's commitment to improving the lives of families on the lowest incomes. ""We all want a social security system that supports families to escape poverty rather than pulling them deeper into it. ""However, this cut risks causing immense, immediate, and avoidable hardship. A strong social security system is a crucial first step to building back better. We strongly urge you to make the right decision."" The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has not carried out an impact assessment for the move. But research by the JRF shows it risks plunging 500,000 people into poverty, including 200,000 children. Analysis shows that 413 constituencies across Great Britain will see over a third of working-age families with children hit by the planned cuts to UC and Working Tax Credit. Of these 413 constituencies, 191 are Conservative – 53 of which were newly won at the last general election or in a subsequent by-election. Cross-party committees from Westminster, the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Welsh Senedd and the Scottish Parliament have all this week called on the Government to make the higher rate of payment permanent. A Government spokesman said: ""As announced by the Chancellor at the Budget, the uplift to Universal Credit was always temporary. It was designed to help claimants through the economic shock and financial disruption of the toughest stages of the pandemic, and it has done so. ""Universal Credit will continue to provide vital support for those both in and out of work and it's right that the Government should focus on our Plan for Jobs, supporting people back into work and supporting those already employed to progress and earn more.""",Real Mirror,598.0
411,Real,The Mirror,"England's schools had £6,500 per pupil in 2019-20, which is 9% lower in real terms than the high-point of £7,200 in 2009-10, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) School spending on each pupil in England will remain lower than before the Tories came to power despite a Government funding boost, damning analysis suggests. The Institute for Fiscal Studies warned that schools in disadvantaged areas face the biggest challenges as they have seen heftier real terms cuts over the last decade. The findings raise serious questions about Boris Johnson's agenda to 'level up' poorer parts of the country in the wake of the pandemic. As a result, schools in deprived areas will find it much harder to catch up with lost learning as they emerge from the coronavirus crisis. It comes as Labour publishes new data showing the UK has had longer school closures than any European country other than Italy. Since January 2020, shortly before Covid hit, British children have been out of their classrooms on nearly half (44%) of days. The figures apply to all four nations of the UK. But by contrast, Irish schools were shut 29% of the time, Spanish schools were shut 19% of days and French pupils missed just 12% of lessons. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is on Thursday announcing an expansion of the catch-up tuition scheme to support up to six million pupils over the next three years. Academic mentors are being placed in selected schools across the country to work in small groups with over 250,000 students most in need of support this year. However, the IFS found that total school spending per pupil in England was just over £6,500 in 2019-20, which is 9% lower in real terms than the high-point of £7,200 in 2009-10. Despite the Government allocating over £7 billion extra for schools, core funding per pupil in 2022–23 will still be about 1-2% lower in real terms than before they came to power. Luke Sibieta, Research Fellow at IFS, said the Tory cuts over the last decade were the largest in more than 40 years. He said: ""The fact that it still won't have recovered back to 2009 levels by 2022 shows just how big the squeeze has been. ""This will make it that much harder for schools to address the major challenge of helping pupils catch up on lost learning alongside everything else they are required to do. ""Schools serving disadvantaged communities face the biggest challenges. ""They faced the biggest cuts up to 2019 and are now receiving the smallest rises. ""This pattern runs counter to the government's aim of levelling up poorer parts of the country."" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said: ""This report clearly shows the real-term freeze in funding that schools have had to cope with for over a decade. ""Despite the Government's bold claims on school funding, it is very clear that school spending per pupil will still be lower in real terms next year than it was a decade ago. ""This is at a time when demands on schools have been increasing. ""There is no escaping the fact that the schools have had and will continue to have to make cuts to provision until this is properly addressed. ""Furthermore, it is those schools serving the most deprived pupils that have seen the biggest losses. ""In light of all this, talk of 'levelling up' starts to sound very hollow indeed."" A Department for Education spokesman said: ""This Government is providing the biggest uplift to school funding in a decade - £14 billion in total over the three years to 2022-23. ""This is a £7.1 billion increase in funding for schools, compared to 2019-20 funding levels.""",Real Mirror,617.0

Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick will meet local government chiefs in the coming days to drum up more support for the resettlement programme. The Government is already working with more than 100 councils across the UK to meet the demand for housing, with over 2,000 places already confirmed. But around 5% of local authorities in Britain - almost 20 - have already refused to take in vulnerable Afghans, with several citing lack of available housing. Ministers are urging more councils to ""step up"" to join around 130 that have already agreed to provide homes for thousands who have fled persecution. Afghan resettlement minister Victoria Atkins said: ""We've had firm offers from at least a third of councils and we're in talks with many, many more, so I'm confident that number will change over the coming days"". Councils are being offered £10,000 for each arrival to help provide them with accommodation and support, including access to health and welfare services and schools. A further £5m has been offered to help provide housing across England, Wales and Scotland, with extra available to help find larger homes for Afghan families. Political leaders in the North of England have promised to welcome refugees from Afghanistan but said they must be distributed fairly across the country. Analysis shows the areas which house the most asylum seekers are among the most deprived. Almost one in four of the UK's 44,825 asylum seekers supported by the Home Office are housed in just 10 local authorities, including Middlesbrough, Cardiff, Rochdale and Glasgow. Only one of the top 10 - Barking and Dagenham in London - is in the South with some other local leaders claiming they are constrained by the lack of affordable housing. Thousands of families are currently in quarantine hotels after being evacuated from Kabul with ministers drawing up plans to take in 20,000 refugees over the next five years. A Government spokesman said: ""Only 5% of councils have declined to sign up to our relocation and assistance scheme and close to a third of councils have already stepped up to support new arrivals, but we know there is more that can be done for those that have risked their lives supporting us. ""We are calling on all councils who have not yet come forward with a firm offer of support to help Afghan nationals and their families as they build a new life here in safety."" We owe more than we can imagine to the translators and support staff who worked with our Armed Forces and diplomats in Afghanistan. Families have had to flee from their homes and all they knew, pursued by threats from the Taliban because of their support for our troops. Many thousands of fellow Afghans have arrived here now securing places through the government's resettlement scheme (ARAP). We're ensuring that those who have arrived have the certainty of leave to remain, the security of access to healthcare and education, the opportunity to build a life in the UK. Earlier this week I met a family who recently arrived, who are being supported by the community in Newark while plans are put in place to move them to a permanent home in the next few weeks. It was a humbling experience. The father had served as an interpreter with British special forces in Helmand. He managed to get his wife and their four beautiful girls out of Kabul, and was immensely grateful for the warm welcome he had received in our country. He said if he could, he would like to serve in the British Army. And I've been heartened to see and hear of other examples of our communities extending their welcome to families arriving up and down the country. We are working hard across government through 'Operation Warm Welcome' to ensure Afghans arriving in the UK receive the vital support they need to rebuild their lives, find work, pursue education and integrate with their local communities. With the welcome support of councils and the British public we will do everything we can in the days, weeks and months ahead to make sure that those fleeing Afghanistan are able to make a success of a new life in the UK.",Real Mirror,749.0

Professor Tim Sharpe, a government advisor, said good ventilation was one way of getting fresh air into often overcrowded school buildings to help drive down infections. The scientific expert from the University of Strathclyde said: ""It's now well established that there is some risk of airborne transmission. ""It is difficult to quantify, but there is some risk so using ventilation is a really good way of mitigating that."" Ministers are coming under pressure to provide ventilation units for all schools to help curb transmission in overcrowded buildings. They have already announced that all state schools will get CO2 monitors this term, at a cost of £25m, to identify where ventilation needs to be improved. They have also launched a trial of air purifiers in 30 schools in Bradford after evidence suggested proper ventilation reduces the spread of the virus 14-fold. Heads have been advised to hold classes and assemblies outdoors where possible. But Prof Sharpe said there was a balance to be had between good ventilation and making sure people are not ""freezing cold"". He added: ""It doesn't mean opening all the windows all the time, it's a managed process and obviously we're balancing things. ""We want to get reasonable levels of ventilation, but we don't want people to be freezing cold, so trying to sort of get that middle ground is something to aim for.""

414,Real,The Mirror,"The Government is under pressure to give clarity on how GCSEs and A-Levels will look next summer Pupils sitting exams this academic year should have their exam results pegged to grades awarded the last two years to help them compete more fairly for jobs and university places. Labour is calling for a level-playing field for this year's GCSE, A-level and BTEC cohorts with those who had their exams disrupted by the pandemic in the summers of 2020 and 2021. They argue that reverting back to 2019 grade distribution would unfairly target next summer's students who have also missed out on substantial amounts of in-school teaching. A consultation into next year's exams launched by the Government and exams watchdog Ofqual closed at the start of August - but no response has yet been published. Yet hundreds of thousands of pupils will return to school within days unclear how they will be examined next year - and what will happen if Covid once again disrupts classes. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is under pressure to set out a clear Plan B should pupils face a third year of academic upheaval as a result of the pandemic. Labour wants two standardised assessment points in the Spring term which could be used to award grades in case of further severe disruption to teaching. Shadow education secretary Kate Green said: ""Pupils, parents and schools need certainty, but the Government still has not got a plan in place despite having more than a year to prepare. ""Young people are returning to classrooms this week with no idea how they will be assessed. ""They are being let down again by a Government which has shown no care for their futures, providing only a vague consultation for this year's exams series."" Labour is calling for students to be given advance notice of topics that may come up by January, rather than later in the Spring, to help them navigate disruption to their studies, and to be offered wider question choice in their exams. They also want back-up papers for those taking exams in November and January in case they are ill or self-isolating due to Covid on the day of their assessment. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said: ""We have pressed for months for the Government to provide information by the start of the autumn term, not only on adaptations to examinations for 2022, but also on its contingency plans. ""Students deserve clarity and staff need this information so they can take it into account when planning for the new academic year."" A DfE spokesperson said: ""Exams are the fairest form of assessment and we intend for them to take place next summer. ""Alongside Ofqual, we have already set out proposals for next year's exams - including information about topics and exam aids - that recognise the disruption the pandemic has caused to education, and we will confirm those plans early this term.

The Government should also fund ventilation units in schools to limit transmission of the virus in overcrowded buildings. Hundreds of schools across the country are expected to reintroduce tougher Covid measures within weeks of returning to the classroom as infections spike. Parents have been warned to expect significant disruption by the end of September with England facing a rise in cases already seen in Scottish schools. Heads have a lengthy ""contingency framework"" to follow with options for what schools can do if cases surge to avoid forcing millions back to home-learning. Dr Mary Bousted, general secretary of the National Education Union, predicted face-masks, bubbles and staggered school hours would return ""sooner rather than later"". She called on ministers to take urgent preventative action to avoid more serious upheaval after children start returning to school later this week. ""It would be much better if schools had not been told to abandon measures which they adopted last term,"" she told the Mirror. ""At a time when Covid infection levels are now 26 times what they were this time last year, it makes no sense to go back into school with so few safety measures. ""We're going to see thousands of pupils and hundreds of teachers having to isolate."" Scientific data has suggested wearing masks in schools could cut Covid transmission by as much as eight times. ""Why have we abandoned measures which would have resulted in a dramatic reduction in transmission, in an unvaccinated age group, in a crowded building?"" she asked. ""Secondary school kids got perfectly used to wearing them. So why are we going back into schools with no masks? ""You only have to look at what's happening in Scotland to see where we're heading.""

They have also launched a trial of air purifiers in 30 schools in Bradford after evidence suggested proper ventilation reduces the spread of the virus 14-fold. Unions are calling for all schools that need them to be provided with ventilation units, funded by the Department for Education. Dr Bousted predicted that vaccines experts on the JCVI would recommend 12 to 15-year-olds get the Covid jab ""quite quickly"" once schools were back. She suggested the body was being ""heavily leaned on"" to speed up their decision with NHS chiefs already on standby to distribute the vaccine. The union chief said jabbing teenagers could take place on school premises - although it would be carried out by local NHS teams. ""I think that's what's going to happen because the levels of vaccination among 16 and 17-year-olds are still quite low,"" she said. ""It's not a school's responsibility but they may be able to provide spaces for vaccination to happen. There could be mobile units in schools."" More than 7.3m million Covid tests are to be carried out on children in schools in the coming days - but after that they will be asked to self-test at home twice a week. Dr Bousted criticised Gavin Williamson for trying to shift the responsibility solely onto parents for ongoing pupil testing. The Education Secretary has urged parents to stop their teenagers getting ""carried away"" as they return to school amid fears of a new Covid surge. ""He is saying parents need to play their part, and that is true,"" she said. ""My concern is that the Government appears to be divesting itself of responsibility for controlling the virus onto parents. ""But the experience with lateral flow testing last term is that the rate of testing dropped off dramatically as the term progressed.

Boris Johnson's official spokesman said the Prime Minister remained 100% committed to the scheme, which will require users to show proof of vaccination on the NHS app to gain entry. ""We set out broadly our intention to require our vaccination for nightclubs and some other settings and we'll be coming forward in the coming weeks with details for that,"" he added. The Government announced the plan just days after clubs reopened their doors in July - even hinting that it could be expanded to pubs and other venues. Mr Johnson said at the time: ""I should serve notice now that by the end of September, when all over-18s will have had their chance to be double-jabbed, we are planning to make full vaccination the condition of entry to nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather."" Ministers hope to boost vaccine uptake among the young - which is well behind other age cohorts - by making it a condition of entry for nightclubs and gigs. Labour has suggested that showing proof of a negative test might be more effective as the double jabbed can still pass on the virus. No 10 also confirmed that ministers intend to roll out a Covid-19 booster programme from September, with over-50s likely to be offered the jabs first. Vaccines chiefs are preparing to make a final decision about the booster campaign, with the NHS in England poised to start the campaign from September 6.

Children's Commissioner for England Rachel de Souza is meeting tech bosses this week to challenge them to help keep children safe by setting up ""age gates"" to view their sites. She has warned that sites which fail to stop children accessing porn or other unsuitable material may be legally forced to introduce age verification. Senior MPs are already urging ministers to impose mandatory age checks to help keep children safe online. Many of the biggest companies, such as Facebook and Twitter, require their users to be at least 13 but the minimum age requirement is widely flouted with many young children simply lie about their age. The Children's Commissioner's office estimates that 60% of 11 to 13-year-olds have stumbled across porn on social media. Dame Rachel told the BBC's Today programme: ""There's a lot that can be done voluntarily. When you do something by the law it takes time. I want those social media companies taking responsibility now"". She added: ""Much as you need to prove your age to buy cigarettes or alcohol, it should be exactly the same in the online world."" She has also proposed three alternative legislative measures for the Government to consider if tech companies are unable to effectively fix the problem of children seeing adult content online - but legal changes will take longer to enact. Shadow Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and sport Jo Stevens said ""For years we have challenged the tech companies to improve their age verification systems which they themselves accept, simply don't work. ""We need stronger measures to protect children online. The evidence children are being damaged by accessing harmful content is overwhelming but for years the government has ignored the problem, hoping it would go away.

Damian Collins, who is chairing a joint committee scrutinising the bill, told The Times: ""At the moment we only have measures that are based on self-declaration.

The British evacuation operation at Kabul Airport wound up at the weekend but there are fears that some Afghans who may be eligible to come to the UK have been left behind. The Government admitted it was ""impossible"" to say how many people may have been left behind amid concern the number who qualified is higher than originally thought. Labour claims there MPs have 5,000 potential refugee cases in their inboxes and said the Government's figures for those eligible are a ""serious underestimate"".

Pakistan's National Security Advisor has warned that abandoning Afghanistan, rather than having a diplomatic relationship with the Taliban, could also cause a mass wave of refugees. The UK hopes international alliances can be formed to exert a ""moderating influence"" on the Taliban regime. Mr Raab held talks with G7 and Nato members, including the US, as well as Qatar and Turkey to find an international consensus on how to deal with Afghanistan's new regime. A spokesman said: ""The Foreign Secretary emphasised the importance of working with like-minded partners on safe passage and exit arrangements for eligible Afghans remaining in the country. ""He affirmed Taliban assurances that foreign nationals and Afghan citizens with travel authorisation will be allowed to depart the country, but underlined we must judge them on their actions, and whether people are allowed safe passage to leave.""

The Government scrapped the measures at the end of last term after hundreds of thousands of children were forced to miss class. They handed over responsibility for testing and tracing to the failed Government scheme. Mr Kyle said: ""Next week, because of Government scrapping mitigation measures and the failure to vaccinate they have created a situation where schools will be a cauldron of Covid. ""This is so serious that if Covid does not tear through our school system in the autumn term, then it's acting in a different way than it has been over the last 18 months.""

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has confirmed that parental consent would be required if vaccines chiefs do green light the roll-out. But Mr Kyle suggested the decision should have been made before the summer holidays to allow time for young people to get jabbed - and stressed the urgency of acting now. ""Ministers should be reopening conversations with the JCVI about offering the vaccine. They need to be quizzed about their rationale for delaying,"" he said.

Trust chief executives fear the Government will offer them £5bn less than required meaning they could be forced to scale back plans for cancer and mental health care.

She said: ""This is a major setback for British foreign policy. We talk of Global Britain. Where is Global Britain on the streets of Kabul? Our foreign policy will be judged on our deeds not our words."" Mrs May said it was ""incomprehensible and worrying"" that the UK was not able to bring together a solution between nations. She said: ""Was our intelligence really so poor? ""Was our understanding of the Afghan government so weak? ""Was our knowledge of the position on the ground so inadequate? ""Or did we just feel we had to follow the US and hope on a wing and a prayer that it would be all right on the night."" Labour leader Keir Starmer attacked Mr Johnson's ""appalling"" lack of leadership. He said: ""It has been a disastrous week, an unfolding tragedy."" ""The lack of planning is unforgivable and the Prime Minister bears a heavy responsibility. He was in a position to lead, but he didn't."" He slammed the Government for failing to use the 18 months it had to prepare for the last Western troops leaving Afghanistan. He said: ""The PM's response to the Taliban at the gates of Kabul was to go on holiday."" And turning on Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, Mr Starmer said: ""I wouldn't have been on holiday when Kabul fell. You cannot coordinate an international response from the beach."" The Prime Minister had told the Commons it was an ""illusion"" to think that Britain alone could have prevented the Taliban taking over. He said the crisis had unfurled ""faster than even the Taliban expected"", effectively conceding ministers were caught off-guard. But he then said: ""It is not true to say that the UK Government was unprepared or did not foresee this."" He insisted Britain would honour its ""enduring commitment"" to Afghans after the fall of Kabul, with the priority evacuating all UK nationals and their allies. Around 20,000 Afghan refugees will be given sanctuary in the UK in the next five years after the Government announced plans to help those fleeing the Taliban. But the Home Office was accused of failing to act urgently after it revealed just 5,000 Afghans would be relocated in the first year. The rattled PM was unable to say whether the remaining 15,000, forced to wait years for resettlement, should just ""hang about and wait until they've been executed?"" Tory MPs lined up to criticise their Government's failure to protect the people of Afghanistan. Addressing a silent Commons, Tom Tugendhat, a former soldier who served in Afghanistan, said he had struggled through ""anger, grief and rage"" over the past week, noting that he had previously watched ""good men go into the earth, taking with them a part of me and a part of all of us"". Mr Tugendhat, who also spent a year as an advisor to the governor of Helmand province, said: ""Let's stop talking about forever wars. ""Let's recognise that forever peace is bought, not cheaply, but hard, through determination and a will to endure. This doesn't need to be defeat, but at the moment it damn well feels like it."" Ex-Army serviceman Tobias Ellwood, chair of the defence select committee, demanded an independent inquiry, but was rebuffed by the PM. He said: ""It is with utter disbelief seeing us make such an operational and strategic blunder by retreating at this time. ""I'm sorry there's no vote here today as I believe the Government would not have the support of the House. The future is very much more unpredictable because of our actions."" Former Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson described the allied forces' withdrawal from Afghanistan as the ""UK's biggest humiliation since Suez"" and America's ""biggest humiliation since Saigon"". Tory MP and former soldier Johnny Mercer, who did three tours of Afghanistan, accused Mr Johnson of ""consistently failing"" veterans struggling with mental health issues. Mr Johnson claimed the UK would not send Afghan refugees who reached Britain back to Kabul.",Real Mirror,872.0
422,Real,The Mirror,"Here are answers to four key questions on the resettlement of Afghan refugees in the UK - from wh Government has promised to what other countries are doing As the UK Government promises to take in up to 20,000 Afghan refugees, but only 5,000 in the first year, we answer four key questions about the scheme. After the fall of Kabul, countries across the developed world are set to see a new wave of migrants as the fall-out from the crisis spreads across the globe. Boris Johnson today insisted Britain would honour its ""enduring commitment"" to Afghans. But he was blasted by a string of Tories, along with figures from Labour, the church and the security services as a recalled Parliament was packed for the first time in 17 months - and anger bubbled over at the unfolding disaster in the capital Kabul. So how will what is being promised by the Tory government work? What are other countries doing? What other help is available? Here is what you need to know. The UK will take up to 20,000 Afghan refugees, with as many as 5,000 in the first year, who were forced to flee their home or face threats of persecution from the Taliban. They will be helped to set up a permanent life here. Priority will be given to women and girls, and religious and other minorities. Many of the details are still unclear but the Home Office said it will be similar to a successful scheme for Syrian refugees. Afghans will have to apply from overseas – probably from refugee camps in the region – and arrive over five years. Councils will support arrivals to rebuild their lives with housing, schools, healthcare and finding jobs. The resettlement scheme is in addition to the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy, which offers locally employed staff whose lives are at risk priority relocation to the UK. Some 5,000 former Afghan staff and their family members are expected to be relocated to the UK by the end of this year under the scheme, with ministers suggesting this number could double. Germany is taking in around 10,000 refugees, while Canada has started with 20,000 and the US could take in up to 9,000 a day. G7 leaders will next week try to strike a deal on assistance, how to assess who is granted refuge and how to deal with a Taliban government.",Real Mirror,400.0
423,Real,The Mirror,"An Afghan girl cradles her little brother as her country descends into hell and families flee the Taliban. Britain has pledged to take 20,000 refugees ... but only 5,000 this year The Tories have finally announced plans to help the Afghans fleeing the Taliban – but the offer has been called ""woefully inadequate"" by one of their own MPs. Around 20,000 of the refugees are set to be given sanctuary in the UK over the coming years. The Home Office has been accused of failing to act quickly enough after it revealed that only 5,000 Afghans facing persecution would be relocated in the first year. It will leave thousands of vulnerable people at risk of violent recrimination. The 20,000 is in addition to 5,000 Afghans – whose lives are in danger because they helped the UK – who are coming under an existing scheme. About 2,000 of them are already here. Afghans who apply as part of the new plans are expected to be forced to make the perilous journey to camps in neighbouring countries including Pakistan and potentially Iran. Refugee groups, opposition parties and Conservatives have criticised the Government for failing to grasp the urgency of the situation for hundreds of thousands of people in Afghanistan after the Taliban retook the capital Kabul. Tory MP Tobias Ellwood, a former Army captain, told the Mirror: ""This is a woefully inadequate response given the scale of the refugee crisis we are about to face as a direct response to our withdrawal from Afghanistan. ""The Government really needs to see the bigger picture here and grasp the scale of the crisis we created. ""We are capping the numbers to 5,000 for the first year, when the threat is at its greatest. And obliging potential applicants to move to a refugee camp is fraught with danger."" The United Nations says roughly 400,000 people in Afghanistan have been forced to flee their homes since the start of the year, with up to 30,000 leaving the country every week. After days of dragging his feet, Boris Johnson has set out his plans at last. The Prime Minister, due to announce the proposals to MPs on Wednesday, said: ""We owe a debt of gratitude to those who worked with us to make Afghanistan a better place over the last 20 years. ""Many of them, particularly women, are now in urgent need of our help."" Parliament has been recalled for an emergency debate on Wednesday on the situation in Afghanistan. Shadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said: ""The Government's incompetence in failing to plan for this has left huge numbers of Afghans' lives in danger, especially women and girls and those who served alongside the British. ""After such catastrophic errors, the Government must step up with a more urgent plan of action."" The resettlement scheme is based on the one that brought in over 20,000 Syrians from refugee camps over seven years. Lib Dem Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Layla Moran, who said 20,000 Afghans should be the starting point for resettlement, not the target, added: ""There is no time to waste. ""The Taliban are knocking on doors and making lists of those they plan to kill. ""We need these vulnerable people out of the country as soon as possible, instead of the Government's vague promise of the 'long term'."" The Taliban says it will guarantee safety for those who previously opposed them and that it will uphold women's rights, but within Sharia law. Foreign policy experts have expressed deep scepticism over the claims and warned that Afghans could once again face brutal oppression. Home Secretary Priti Patel last night chaired a meeting of the Five Eyes intelligence allies – comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the US – to identify safe routes for those who have to flee. Germany says it must urgently evacuate around 10,000 vulnerable people from Afghanistan. Canada has promised to resettle over 20,000 Afghans who are at risk. The US figure is roughly 30,000. Refugee charities had urged UK ministers to offer sanctuary to much higher numbers than 20,000. The Government fears the Taliban will close Kabul airport, where 900 British troops are helping to evacuate UK nationals and some Afghans. An Afghan woman in Feltham, West London, was in tears as she spoke of her concerns for her elderly parents who remain in Kabul. She said: ""They were scared when the Taliban came. I am very worried about them. They are old people."" NHS doctor and former refugee Dr Waheed Arian has called for the Government to treat incoming asylum seekers with compassion. He added the UK's response to the humanitarian crisis ""has been too late"". - Comment, by Lord Alf Dubs, Kinder Transport Refugee We owe it to the people of Afghanistan and ourselves to show responsibility by welcoming our share of refugees alongside other countries in Europe and around the world. The main reason for taking them is humanitarian, to give them safety, but we will enjoy a net gain because they will make a huge contribution to our country. They are brave, resourceful, committed to civic society and will be hoping to build new lives in their new home country.",Real Mirror,861.0
424,Real,The Mirror,"The shadow foreign secretary has said putting a limit on the number of refugees from the war-torn country ""at this stage would be really unconscionable"" The Government has condemned Afghans to death by ""dragging its feet"" over getting them out to safety before the Taliban takeover, Labour has said. Lisa Nandy called on ministers to urgently set up ""safe and legal routes"" including processing visa applications outside the war-torn country for vulnerable Afghans. In an interview with the Mirror, she warned: ""We've got hours, not days, to get that right."" The shadow foreign secretary urged the Government to use its international leverage to agree immediate humanitarian assistance for the war-torn country. ""We're not a superpower but we're not powerless. We do have some leverage here,"" she said. The Labour MP claimed the delay in helping vulnerable Afghans was a ""shameful moment"" for the British government that had left millions feeling ""betrayed"". She contrasted it with the courage of the British ambassador and diplomats staying in Kabul to help speed up applications, charity workers and the UK military. British forces are evacuating UK citizens still in the country as the situation worsens with Afghans and foreigners at growing risk of Taliban retribution. Hundreds of locals - including translators and those who helped the media and British Council - are at particular risk from the new regime. Ms Nandy said: ""The absolutely immediate priority is not just British citizens out but all of those Afghans who helped us. ""The approach that Canada is taking is to get them out and then process applications. ""The alternative is that many people who supported us for two decades will be left in Afghanistan and they and their families will be killed. ""That's the reality we're facing... Because of way the Government has dragged its feet over the last few weeks there are some people who will lose their lives as a consequence."" Millions more Afghans who have promoted Western values, supported girls education and championed equality are now also living in fear for their lives. Labour is calling for a coordinated international response, led by the United Nations, to offer homes to refugees who end up in neighbouring countries. ""It's really important that Britain steps up and pays our full part,"" she said. ""Given our history in the region the idea of putting a limit on numbers at this stage would be really unconscionable. ""But no one country is going to be able to deal with this alone, we are witnessing a refugee crisis of the scale we haven't seen for decades."" Ms Nandy described as ""horrific"" the situation facing millions of Afghans, in particular women and girls, under the Taliban once again. ""There's a new generation that has grown up with very different expectations of what their future will hold and they're watching all that disintegrate in front of their eyes."" She insisted that the UK, as chair of the G7 nations, a leading Nato member and sitting on the UN security council, still had a role to play. ""We have to find a way of exerting pressure and leverage to try to protect some of those gains that we've fought so hard for over the last 20 years."" The Opposition is urging ministers to explain whether they tried to change US minds over recent weeks, when the Taliban was already gaining ground in Afghanistan. ""The decision in hindsight to withdraw was a catastrophic miscalculation and it's not at all clear what pressure our Government put on the US to try to reverse that decision,"" she said. She criticised the ""rushed"" withdrawal of troops compounded with ""appalling"" messages about the UK's ongoing commitment to Afghan people. ""Withdrawing troops was one thing, but walking away from the Afghan people is quite another,"" she said. ""This has done our reputation irreparable harm, but all of that pales into insignificance compared to the actual consequences for Afghan people and potentially for people in Britain as well, if Afghanistan becomes a haven for terrorists and extremists again."" Ms Nandy criticised Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab for their ""complete wall of silence"" as the situation on the ground escalated. ""In eleven years of Parliament I've never seen a Government that is so absent in a moment of this magnitude,"" she said. ""There were about seven or eight days when this was all unfolding when there were no Government spokespeople out at all."" However, she admitted that the ""speed and scale"" of the Taliban advance to Kabul had taken everybody by surprise. She denied that Labour had also failed to address the unfolding catastrophe, claiming the Opposition had been ""active and vocal and trying to get answers"". But she admitted the last Labour government had ""completely underestimated"" what it would take to help the Afghan people establish a secure state.",Real Mirror,800.0
425,Real,The Mirror,"Research by the respected IFS think tank found the benefits of the centres were ""substantial"" - with children in poorer neighbourhoods getting most More than 13,000 hospital admissions of children a year were prevented by Sure Start centres before their funding was cut by the Tories, research has found. The Institute for Fiscal Studies found that the benefits of the centres were ""substantial"" with children in poorer neighbourhoods getting most out of them. Sure Start centres, which brought together health, parenting support and childcare for the under-5s, received £1.8bn a year at their 2009 peak. But spending has fallen by more than two-thirds over the last decade under the Tories with many centres scaled back or closed. The IFS research, funded by the Nuffield Foundation, found that the early years programme delivered long-lasting health benefits for children well into their teenage years. And the savings from reduced hospitalisations up to age 15 offset around 31% of spending on the programme. Maud Pecher, a co-author of the report, said: ""Children who had greater access to Sure Start in their early years were far less likely to be hospitalised later on - at its peak, Sure Start provision prevented over 13,000 hospitalisations of 11 to 15-year-olds each year. ""These benefits were particularly long-lasting for boys and children in disadvantaged neighbourhoods."" Yet there was almost mo evidence that Sure Start had improved children's hospital admission outcomes in the richest neighbourhoods. The research suggested prioritising spending on early years programmes in disadvantaged areas would make sure services are better targeted to children's health. Early Years Alliance chief executive Neil Leitch said: ""The fact that the Sure Start programme is still paying dividends for children into their teenage years is yet more confirmation of what we already know - that investing in young children is not only the right thing to do, it is also a sound financial decision. ""Recent governments have shamefully let down children and families by not only cutting Sure Start services which reduce hospitalisations, and do much more good besides, but also by allowing funding for under-five education to dwindle to far less than the cost of delivering it."" A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""We recognise that the early years of a child's life are the most crucial, which is why we have put unprecedented investment into childcare over the past decade"".",Real Mirror,392.0
426,Real,The Mirror,"As self-isolation rules change from today to exempt the double-jabbed, firms including Asda, lastminute.com and National Express are offering a cash incentive to get your second dose Fully vaccinated people will no longer need to self isolate from today if someone they meet tests positive for coronavirus - as the young are offered shopping discounts to boost jabs uptake. The legal requirement on jabbed Brits to quarantine for 10 days if they are contacted by Test and Trace has been lifted under a major change of the rules. More than three quarters of adults are now inoculated against the virus and the Government is banking on the success of the vaccine rollout to lift the remaining Covid restrictions. Boris Johnson faced significant criticism over the so-called pingdemic in July, when thousands of people were forced into isolation due to contacts with positive cases. Businesses sounded the alarm over staffing shortages and empty shelves - prompting the Government into chaotic U-turns over the reducing the sensitivity of the NHS Covid App and allowing key workers to be exempt. Now the blanket self-isolation rules for Covid contacts have been axed for all fully vaccinated people and the under-18s. But ministers are concerned about slow vaccine uptake among the young - with more of the country's best-known businesses offering incentives to encourage them to get the jab. Asda, lastminute. com and National Express are among firms providing rewards to the jabbed, joining Uber, Bolt and Deliveroo which are already offering discounted rides and meals. Asda will offer £10 vouchers for their clothing brand George to 18 to 30-year-olds who spend over £20, while lastminute. com is giving over-18s £30 gift cards towards holidays abroad. Better leisure centres will offer over-16s a £10 voucher to use on any membership and a free three-day pass at any of their 235 leisure facilities across the UK. Free Now is giving up to £1m in free taxi rides for over-18s attending their vaccine appointment while National Express Buses is providing 1,000 people 5-day unlimited travel saver tickets. Health Secretary Sajid Javid already plans for Covid vaccine booster shots to go to vulnerable groups and over-50s from September. Ministers are said to be discussing plans to the booster shots compulsory for care home staff and quarantine-free travel abroad. They have suggested the ""logical"" next step would be to make these jabs a condition of keeping a person's vaccine status up-to-date. It would mean that travel benefits for some double-jabbed Brits - for instance, being spared quarantine on return from amber list countries - may only continue if they get triple-jabbed. Likewise, the requirement for England's care home staff to be double-jabbed from autumn could extend to booster jabs too. Mr Javid said: ""The requirement for double-jabbed and under-18s who are contacts of people with Covid has been removed as we cautiously take another step back towards normality, thanks to the phenomenal success of our vaccine rollout. ""Vaccines are what will bring this pandemic to an end – with over 84,000 lives already saved and 23 million infections prevented. Please come forward to receive your jab as soon as you can to protect yourself and the people around you.""",Real Mirror,530.0
427,Real,The Mirror,"An independent report says GCSE exams should be axed, while A-level exams should be scaled back with more emphasis put on teachers' grades Stressful ""do or die"" A-level exams which can decide the fate of pupils should be radically overhauled, education experts have said. An independent report calls for them to be replaced by grades based on a mixture of exams and marks given by teachers for classwork. It recommends that ""unfair"" GCSE exams are scrapped entirely as they fail to measure what is important for teenagers' futures. GCSE and A-level results last week saw record grade inflation as teacher assessments replaced school exams due to the pandemic. But ministers have resisted making the changes permanent and have insisted that youngsters will sit GCSE and A-level exams next year. The independent commission's report, due for publication later this year, is fuelled by concern that the UK has some of the most stressed youngsters. According to the NHS, one in ten of 5 to 16-year-olds has a diagnosable mental health problem such as depression. Education experts told the Sunday Times that England's GCSE and A-level system is broken and creates unnecessary anxiety and unfairness for children. Virtually no other country has as many school exams for 16-year-olds as England. Prof Louise Hayward of the University of Glasgow, chair of the commission, said. ""Do or die exams are stressful, unfair and they don't measure what is important for young people's future. ""We ask youngsters to sit too many exams, and they switch them off learning. ""The case for radical change is overwhelming if we want to give young people a better future."" Alison Peacock, head of the Chartered College of Teaching, said the ""unfair"" exam system led to a third of 16-year-olds failing crucial maths and English GCSEs every year. She said it was ""devastating"" and cruel to write off so many lives. However, schools minister Nick Gibb has said it would be a ""huge mistake"" to scrap the formal assessments at the age of 16. When asked for his response to Tories calling for reform, he said: ""Well I respectfully disagree. ""Every curriculum, every exam, of course can always be improved, but the concept of having an exam across a range of subjects at the age of 16 is an important part of our school system.""

The Labour leader claimed attempts to force workers back were ""wrongheaded"" and were contrary to the progress made on flexible working during the pandemic. Some Cabinet ministers are planning a ""big push"" to get their staff back to Whitehall from next month - and want employers to do the same. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has highlighted the benefits of office working, saying it had been ""really beneficial"" working in an office environment early in his career. But No 10 has said they would follow a ""cautious"" approach to civil servants returning to their offices, with departments able to be flexible in how the process is managed. In an interview with the Guardian, Mr Starmer said it was wrong for people to be made to go back in when the Government had asked them to work from home in the first place. This was especially the case if they were being threatened with pay cuts or the loss of London weighting from their salaries. ""I just think it's wrongheaded,"" he said. ""People were asked to work at home. And they did, and they worked very hard. ""The idea now that people are being threatened, if they don't come in when there's no good reason – it's wrong."" Mr Starmer said that the pandemic had ""absolutely destroyed the myth"" that people working from home were not actually working. He added that it was ""a bit rich"" of Boris Johnson to encourage people to get back to the office when he regularly works from his grace-and-favour country home at Chequers. The move to more flexible working is widely regarded to have been one of the few good things to have come out of the last 18 months. Both unions and employers' groups have highlighted the benefits of flexible working to both companies and their staff. Labour has promised a right to flexible working - employees can currently request it but businesses are only obliged to consider it in a ""reasonable"" manner. Recent research from the TUC found that 82% of workers want to work flexibly in the future, rising to 87% among female employees. Yet 71% of flexible working requests were rejected in 2020, up from 53% the previous year.",Real Mirror,407.0
429,Real,The Mirror,"Lawyers claimed forcing fully-jabbed people were facing an 'unlawful deprivation of liberty' by being forced to isolate in Government-approved facilities A law firm representing international travellers is planning to take legal action against the UK's 'red list' hotel quarantine policy. They are seeking a judicial review claiming that forcing double jabbed travellers who have tested negative to spend 11 nights in a hotel breaches their human rights. London-based lawyers PGMBM claim that it is an ""unlawful deprivation of liberty"" which amounts to ""false imprisonment"". At the moment, travellers arriving in the UK from a red list country must enter a quarantine hotel, even if they have had both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine. There are currently 60 locations on the red list, such as Mexico, Pakistan, Turkey, and much of South America and Africa. The cost of staying in a quarantine hotel jumped from £1,750 to £2,285 on Thursday. Ireland and Norway - the only other European countries with mandatory quarantine - have updated their schemes so the double jabbed are exempt. The law firm's managing partner Tom Goodhead said: ""Mandatory hotel quarantine is a fundamental breach of human rights. ""It has led to the false imprisonment of people who are fully vaccinated and have tested negative. ""Prisoners are entitled to more liberty than those forced to quarantine in hotels. ""We have all read about the horrific experiences of some of the people in these hotels. ""We want to see this draconian policy scrapped and those affected to be properly compensated"". Their clients include people in the UK who want to visit family in a red list country, as well as those who have already done hotel quarantine. But the legal team are seeking compensation and refunds for anyone who has been double-jabbed in the UK and has stayed at a quarantine hotel. Mr Goodhead said the majority of the people who got in touch with the law firm were not travelling to or from red list countries for holidays or for leisure. ""They are often travelling for emergency or urgent reasons and would not be travelling unless they felt it was absolutely necessary,"" he added. It is the second case PGMBM has brought about quarantine hotels. The first resulted in the Government offering the option to pay in 12 monthly instalments for those facing financial hardship. A Government spokesperson said: ""We are determined to protect our country and the progress we have made thanks to the vaccine rollout. ""That is why the Government has taken decisive action at the border, including the introduction of the managed quarantine system. ""Every essential check we've introduced has strengthened our defences against the risk of new coronavirus variants.

A poll by Ipsos Mori also revealed that 49% of people want the Government to increase spending on public services, even if that means higher taxes or more borrowing. Ministers floated the idea of putting up NI to pay for social care reform earlier this year and more detail on the Government's proposals is expected next month. It is more than two years since Boris Johnson stood outside Downing Street and promised he had a plan to fix the crisis once and for all. But the NI move would mean the Tories breaking a manifesto pledge not to raise taxes to pay for public spending. Gideon Skinner, head of politics at Ipsos Mori, said: ""Even though it might have been dampened by the pandemic, there is still some appetite amongst Brits for more spending on public services. ""In particular, they can be persuaded to support tax rises that will be used to pay for improvements to public services, with proposals to raise National Insurance to pay for social care reform or to clear the NHS backlog.

Support for increased public spending - either through higher taxes or borrowing - has ""slipped"" from 66% at the end of 2018 to 56% just before the 2019 election. It now stands at just under half - 49% - in favour of increased public spending. There is a partisan divide, with 74% of 2019 Labour voters wanting more spending, compared with only 40% of 2019 Conservative supporters.

MPs are understood to be keen avoid further disruption to schooling Health chiefs are under growing pressure to extend jabs to the over-12s before schools go back in September. Around 86% of parents with children under 16 would 'definitely or probably' say yes to them having the Covid vaccine, according to the Office of National Statistics. Ministers and school leaders are understood to be keen to help avoid further disruption to schooling. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation announced last week that 16 to 17-year olds would get their first dose to help curb infection rates. NHS England said nearly 16,000 people older teenagers have already received their vaccine over the weekend. The JCVI is waiting for more data on safety and effectiveness before deciding if younger secondary age children should also be offered a first jab. Many countries have already decided to vaccinate children over the age of 12 - including Canada, Brazil, the US, France, the Netherlands and Italy. Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London, said vaccinating all teenagers would be ""a good thing"" as the more unvaccinated people there were, the more lungs there were ""for virus to percolate in"". The jabs expert said children who have the virus but do not have symptoms are ""as dangerous to the spread as anybody else"". Prof Altmann added: ""From a medical scientific point of view, I'd say there's nothing special about the virus in their lungs that can't transmit through to their families, through to their schoolteachers, through to their colleagues"". His comments came after Professor Sir Andrew Pollard said pupils who are not unwell should not have to isolate after being exposed to a positive case. Sir Andrew, who helped to create the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and is a professor of paediatric infection at the University of Oxford, said that as long as children who are contacts are not ill, they should continue to be in school getting their education.

Professor Linda Bauld warned more restrictions may be needed if a new variant emerges which ""challenges"" the existing vaccines. But she said that ""if we can get through"" the winter, the pandemic in the UK should come to an end in 2022, just over two years after it started. The scientist at Edinburgh University added it is hoped we will be ""emerging from the pandemic which is an immediate risk to health to everybody in an area, to an endemic situation"". Vaccine hesitancy among young people has decreased. In those aged 18 to 21, it almost halved from 9 per cent to 5 per cent. Health officials hope it will translate into higher uptake of the jab. The Office for National Statistics survey also showed hesitancy has fallen from 14 per cent to 11 per cent in people aged 16 and 17 – who only qualified for the jab last week. The extension of the rollout means 1.4 million more teenagers are eligible for the first dose of the Pfizer jab, with advice on the second to come later. Incentives including cash prizes, discounted taxi rides and takeaways had been offered in a bid to boost uptake among older teenagers. Overall, 96 per cent of people between June 23 and July 18 reported positive feelings towards Covid jabs, while 4 per cent reported hesitancy.

433,Real,The Mirror,"Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the regime 'continues to crush democracy and violate human rights' in Belarus, a year on from its 'fraudulent election' Britain has slapped sanctions on Belarus to pile pressure on President Alexander Lukashenko over human rights abuses of political opponents and journalists. The Belarusian regime took power a year ago in an election which critics said was rigged, leading to tens of thousands of people protesting on the streets of Minsk. Lukashenko, who is backed by Moscow, responded with a brutal crackdown on his critics in which many have been arrested or gone into exile abroad. The UK has now banned Belarusian potash and petroleum exports from Belarus, as well as restricting financial transactions by its government and state-owned banks. The measures also prevent their aircraft from flying over or landing in the UK and any technical assistance being given to the President's fleet of luxury planes. So far Western sanctions have done little to persuade Lukashenko, in power in the former Soviet republic since 1994, to change course from his crackdown on political opponents. But Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: ""These sanctions demonstrate that the UK will not accept Lukashenko's actions since the fraudulent election. ""The Lukashenko regime continues to crush democracy and violate human rights in Belarus. ""The products of Lukashenko's state-owned industries will not be sold in the UK, and our aerospace companies will not touch his fleet of luxury aircraft."" However, the Belarusian President said Britain should ""choke"" on the sanctions, adding: ""You are America's lapdogs"". EU sanctions designed to punish Lukashenko for the crackdown will leave him largely unscathed and able to continue financing the economy and his security forces, analysts say. Meanwhile, Polish authorities reported that a record number of migrants have crossed the Polish border with Belarus since Friday. Poland and Lithuania, which have seen a surge in illegal migration in recent weeks, have accused Lukashenko of using migrants to put pressure on the EU to reverse sanctions. Warsaw also believes it is way of hitting back at Poland for giving refuge to Krystsina Tsimanouskaya, a Belarusian athlete who refused to return home from the Tokyo Olympics.",Real Mirror,358.0
434,Real,The Mirror,"EXCLUSIVE: The Labour deputy leader is calling on the Government to urgently boost statutory sick pay and make it illegal for bosses to dismiss staff when self-isolating ahead of the launch of a new campaign Angela Rayner has revealed that her son was forced to borrow money from her to survive isolation as she urged the Government to increase sick-pay. Labour's deputy leader said her 24-year-old, Ryan, who works in hospitality, was among thousands of people losing out out for doing the right thing when exposed to coronavirus. She called on the Government to urgently boost statutory sick pay, currently £96.35 a week, and make it illegal for bosses to dismiss staff when self-isolating. ""The cost of not doing that is that they spread the virus and more people are off and it costs the economy more in the long run,"" she said. ""It's an awful feeling trying to raise a family not knowing whether you're going to have a wage next week or not, and feeling frightened to ring your employer to say I need to self-isolate."" Labour is launching a campaign on Monday to make Britain the ""best place to work"" after a decade under the Tories which has seen family incomes stagnating, more than 3.6m people in insecure work and in-work poverty at a record high. Over the coming days, they will set out plans to end insecure work in the gig economy and make sure all employees have full rights from day one on the job. Ms Rayner, whose role covers the future of work, said the Government now faced a ""fork in the road"" as the country emerged from the pandemic In an interview with the Mirror, she said: ""Work should pay and it should also provide you with a good standard of living, so it's not just about surviving, it's about thriving."" She claimed the Tories would allow workers to ""sink or swim"" on their own and warned their plans to rip up workers' rights could take the country back to the Victorian era. The Labour MP said the pandemic had shown the depth of the divide between those in low-paid, insecure work, and those in secure well-paid jobs. ""They had a buffer that stopped them from having the most adverse affects of the pandemic, she said. ""Whereas those who were in the most precarious work, usually frontline, found that they were more at risk, less likely to be able to self-isolate, less likely to have sick pay, more likely to be low paid. You could see the divide really starkly."" According to TUC analysis, two million workers in the UK do not earn enough to qualify for statutory sick pay, while others are on insecure contracts. Not everybody is eligible for a one-off £500 payment for low-paid workers forced to self-isolate. Ms Rayner said: ""Even my son was asking me to give him a loan because he's not going to be paid. He's got two children and he's got to self-isolate. ""If they're not on a secure contract there's no entitlement to the pay. A lot of people have used up holidays - the give that was in the system isn't there now. ""If you have to self-isolate you should be compensated for that, because you're doing the right thing for the country and stopping the virus spreading. ""Not everybody has a parent to help them out financially. I want everybody to have that entitlement. It's not fair that some people are really struggling."" She added: ""The Government is absolutely out of touch with this problem. It's not just a small number, it's a significant numbers and it's growing."" Ms Rayner defended unions as a force for good, insisting: ""If you look after your workforce, they will look after you and your business will thrive as a result. ""Actually the Labour Party is pro-business and pro-trade union, when they work together that is the sweet spot. ""Look at Germany's industrial model, they work with the trade unions and have a much stronger economy and skilled workforce."" She added: ""If you've not been involved in the union movement, people do have this view of them from the 1980s, that they're all out on strike. It couldn't be further from the truth."" After months of poor poll ratings, Ms Rayner denied this summer was make-or-break for Keir Starmer's leadership. She insisted: ""This is Labour's opportunity to show that we're winning, that we're back in the game. ""We'll be showing that we're a Government in waiting, not just any old a Government, but one that is going to be life-changing."" 1. Security at work - full rights from day one on the job; outlawing fire and rehire; new right to flexible work2.

435,Real,The Mirror,"EXCLUSIVE: Senior Government sources told the Mirror the popular holiday destination was being ""watched closely"" by ministers and was looking a ""risky bet"" for trips abroad Italy could be the next country to be added to the ""amber plus"" travel list throwing thousands more holiday plans into chaos, the Mirror has learned. Senior Government sources revealed the popular holiday destination was being ""watched closely"" by ministers and was looking a ""risky bet"" for trips abroad. Ministers are understood to be concerned about sharply increasing Covid transmission rates, with the Delta variant rapidly gaining traction. Italian health experts believe the increase has been fuelled in part by huge street celebrations after the country's Euro 2020 win earlier this month. The Italian government is particularly concerned about the spread of the virus among the two million people over the age of 60 who are still completely unvaccinated. Analysis by Labour suggests that around 900,000 Brits are planning holidays in Italy this summer, and some of the most popular destinations are already seeing steep rises in cases. If Spain and Greece also go on the amber plus list amid concerns over the more vaccine resistant Beta variant, the holiday plans of nearly 8 million people could be ruined. But Whitehall insiders have predicted that France could go back on the amber list at the next travel review, expected on August 5, after a huge Cabinet row. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is said to have been furious at the decision taken last week to require those travelling back from France to quarantine. The Government introduced an exemption for the requirement to isolate at home for 10 days for fully-vaccinated holidaymakers returning from countries on the amber list. But ministers removed the exemption for France amid concerns over the Beta variant, creating what critics call an ""amber plus"" designation on the traffic light system for foreign travel. Shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: ""If the government don't get a grip on this soon, the prospect of a summer holiday after a long and difficult 18 months is going to be snatched away from people at the last minute. ""These eleventh-hour decisions and refusal to give people the tools to make an informed plan, after already failing to protect our borders, simply cannot continue. ""Ministers risk shattering public confidence and strangling the travel industry - and the hundreds of thousands of jobs it supports - beyond any hope of recovery."" Home Office minister Kit Malthouse has apologised for delays at the borders after travellers complained about ""total chaos"" at airports as schools closed and summer holidays began. Passengers complained of long queues to get through departures and arrivals at the weekend, with images posted on social media showing crowded terminals.

436,Real,The Mirror,"Labour slammed the 'hypocritical' measures as police recieved a real terms pay cut last week. The PM will emerge from his 10 day self isolation in Chequers on Tuesday Boris Johnson unveil plans for every victim of crime to have a named police officer as he tries to shift the focus away from the pandemic. The Prime Minister will publish his new neighbourhood policing plan despite years of Tory cuts to frontline services and police anger towards ministers. Labour accused the Government of hypocrisy after the number of police officers fell by 21,000 over the last decade, and the police last week received a real terms pay cut. Mr Johnson is expected to announce his new ""beating crime"" policing strategy after leaving quarantine at his Chequers country retreat. As he began his third year in No 10, Mr Johnson vowed to ensure that every victim of crime has ""a named officer to call - someone who is immediately on your side"". The PM, writing in the Sunday Express, said: ""We want everyone to know that if you are the victim of crime you have a named officer to call - someone who is immediately on your side"". Other measures he outlined included publishing league tables for 101 and 999 call answering times, putting more police into dealing with ""the tiny minority of truant kids"", and intensifying efforts against county lines drug gangs. But shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said: ""The hypocrisy from this Government knows no bounds. ""It is the Conservatives that decided to cut the number of frontline officers by 21,000, which has hammered neighbourhood policing. ""Ministers also insulted police officers this week with a zero percent pay offer. No wonder the Police Federation have no confidence in this Home Secretary."" The Police Federation's national chairman, John Apter, has said his members are ""so angry with this Government"" over their real terms pay cut. ""At the beginning of this pandemic they endured PPE shortages and were not even prioritised for the vaccination,"" he said. ""They continue to be politicised and this pay announcement is the final straw. ""As the organisation that represents more than 130,000 police officers I can say quite categorically: we have no confidence in the current Home Secretary.

437,Real,The Mirror,"Boris Johnson's Covid-rule chaos hits pupils as thousands are forced to self-isolate with one million kids off school in pingdemic pandemonium - a lesson in chaos More than a million pupils missed class last week as the pingdemic gripping the nation sparked chaos in schools. The figure is expected to rise this week. Boris Johnson was accused of ""abandoning kids"" amid fears the autumn term will also be hit unless he tackles the crisis. One union said: ""Doing nothing and hoping for the best next term risks making things worse."" Mr Johnson was tonight accused of standing by and watching as a further Covid crisis threatens to engulf education. More than a million pupils missed class last week due to infections or isolation, figures show. The record number is expected to be even higher this week as the pinging mayhem hammers schools. Ministers face urgent calls to avoid another wave of disruption when classes in England restart in September. But No10 admitted it could not guarantee they would resume properly next term without more pupils being sent home to isolate. Labour accused the Tories of ""washing their hands"" of responsibility towards children. And NAHT union general secretary Paul Whiteman said: ""Simply doing nothing and hoping for the best next term not only fails to address the problem, it risks making things worse."" Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton added: ""These figures bring a year of educational disruption to a grim end. Schools and colleges face another set of challenges when students return. ""They need substantial financial and practical support for on-site testing, high-quality air ventilation and robust outbreak management plans."" National Education Union joint general secretary Kevin Courtney warned the Government it ""must look all the harder"" at preventing the spread of the virus in schools from September. Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green said: ""The Conservatives have abandoned the nation's children, with no action taken to turn the tide on rising cases in schools. ""Parents and schools have been crying out for help but they have washed their hands of their responsibility to keep children learning."" The absence rate from schools hit 14.3% last week – a record high since pupils returned in March. That was up from 11.2% on July 8 and 8.5% on July 1. It includes 934,000 children isolating due to a possible contact, 47,200 pupils with a confirmed Covid case, and 34,500 with a suspected one. And 34,800 pupils were off as a result of closures due to Covid, the Department for Education said. Heads have been sending whole year groups home and some schools have closed early for the summer break. Many parents are opting not to send children in for the final week of term to avoid the risk of quarantine ruining their summer holidays. Downing Street said it ""hoped and indeed expected"" parents would continue sending their kids to school. A DfE spokesman said: ""Our priority is for schools and colleges to deliver face-to-face, high-quality education to all, as we know being out of education causes significant harm to educational attainment, life chances, mental and physical health."" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has already said class ""bubbles"" can be scrapped but left it up to individual schools to decide whether to keep them. The absence figures come as thousands of revellers flocked to clubs on ""Freedom Day"". Huge crowds of mostly maskless people queued outside Birmingham's Rosies and PRYZM venues on Monday. The heat and rising Covid cases did nothing to put off party-goers across the land from hitting clubs, for the first time in 16 months. ""My 11-year-old daughter takes most things in her stride - but being told she can't attend her last ever week of primary school is really getting her down. Ellie was instructed on Sunday night that she - like more than a million other children across the country - would have to self-isolate for 10 days because she'd come into contact with a positive Covid case last Friday afternoon. Ellie had actually taken a test that day as she was going to her class sleepover, but despite that coming back negative - and every test since then not showing any signs of infection - she must stay home for another week. Instead of making memories with her friends, saying goodbye to her school and taking part in all the fun end-of-year events - her class had planned a massive water fight on the field because of the weather - she's got to stay in. Her school have even had to set them homework to do while they're off, although the teachers can't expect much to get done in the last week of term. When I think of how Boris Johnson tried to wriggle out of his own self-isolation by claiming he and Rushi Sunak were part of a pilot scheme, it makes me furious. What a joke, it just made me think... what's the point anymore? It wasn't like they'd announced this scheme three weeks ago, he literally just chose it on the day, then U-turned on it.",Real Mirror,844.0

In a bombshell interview with the BBC, Boris Johnson 's former top aide said ""no-one on earth"" knows whether leaving the EU was a good idea for Britain. ""It's perfectly reasonable to say Brexit was a mistake and... history will prove that of course it's reasonable for some people to think that,"" he said. ""But questions like is Brexit a good idea? No-one on earth knows if that's, what the answer to that is."" Mr Cummings admitted that the notorious referendum claim that the U.

Asked whether he was EU withdrawal was the right thing for Britain, he replied: ""I think anyone who says they're sure about questions like that has got a screw loose, whether you're on the Remain side or our side. ""In Vote Leave we didn't think that we're definitely right and Remainers are all idiots or traitors... I think it's perfectly reasonable to say Brexit was a mistake and history will prove that"". He denied stirring up division with ""provocative"" tactics - such as the prorogation of Parliament which led to the Government's defeat at the Supreme Court - to help drive Brexit through. Mr Cummings, who went on to help Mr Johnson secure an 80-seat majority, instead blamed any divisions on those who didn't want to accept the result of the 2016 referendum. He claimed that it would not have been possible to implement the decision to quit the EU by an inclusive ""kumbaya"" approach.

439,Real,The Mirror,"The TUC has carried out a survey of 36,000 mums with parenting website Mother Pukka and warn 'working mums are still feeling the impact of the pandemic' Nearly two-thirds of working mums with primary school age children do not have enough childcare for the school summer holidays, ministers were warned today. The situation is even worse for single mums, with more than three in four revealing that they don't have adequate childcare in place. Many childcare and holiday clubs have shut down as a result of the pandemic leaving parents with limited options during the six-week break. Most school children have around 62 days of holiday a year, while the average employee holiday allowance is just 25 days. The TUC has carried out a survey of 36,000 mums with parenting website Mother Pukka on the challenges of managing work and childcare for the school summer holiday. The union body is calling for 10 days' paid carer's leave for all parents and stronger legal rights to flexible work for all workers - to help parents get through this summer and beyond. They have also urged the Government to invest more in good quality affordable childcare throughout the year. Frances O'Grady, TUC general secretary, said: ""While restrictions may be lifting and ministers talk about us getting back to normal, working mums are still feeling the impact of the pandemic. ""Most mums told us they don't have enough childcare for the upcoming school holidays and are now facing a huge challenge managing their work and caring responsibilities this summer. ""It shouldn't be this difficult. If ministers don't act, we risk mums being forced out of the labour market, and turning the clock back on generations of progress women have made at work."" She added: ""I'd urge employers to be as supportive as they can to their staff who have kids, and not force them back to the office if working at home helps them balance their work and childcare."" Boris Johnson announced that the working from home instruction would end on July 19 as part of the Government's 'big unlock' - but ministers have since suggested employees should not all rush back to work from Monday. The survey found that three in five working mums across the public and private sector thought they would find managing childcare over the summer break harder this year. Of these, 18% said they had already used all their annual leave for home-schooling during lockdown while 20% do not have their usual network of family and friends to rely on. Around 13% said they did not have access to their usual school holiday summer clubs. Previous research by the TUC has shown that working mums have picked up the lion's share of extra caring responsibilities during the pandemic. Many parents are now relying on being able to work more flexibly then before to cope, while others have reduced their paid hours at work or have taken unpaid leave. Anna Whitehouse, founder of Mother Pukka, said: ""If we are going to recover from this pandemic and ensure the playing field is level for men and women at some point in the future, we need childcare to be part of our infrastructure – as important as roads, railways and signposts. ""If it's tough for a two-parent family, have a moment to consider a single parent family. The current system has parents at breaking point. ""We want to not just break the cycle, but rebuild a whole new way of working for parents which doesn't leave them logging off from their careers or disconnected from their family.""",Real Mirror,596.0
440,Real,The Mirror,"EXCLUSIVE: Prime Minister Boris Johnson will give a major speech on his levelling up agenda on Thursday as MPs point out the £4.8bn fund has seen Tory areas handed money intended for struggling towns Boris Johnson's 'levelling up' agenda amounts to ""window-dressing and bungs"" while he is failing to deliver long-term change for communities, MPs claim today. A group of moderate Labour MPs is calling on him to concentrate on tackling the ""fundamental weaknesses"" in the British economy that drive regional inequality. The Prime Minister was urged to focus on creating decent well-paid jobs, to support working people through skills training and by backing industry, and invest in quality public services. In a statement, the MPs said: ""This is the real levelling up agenda the Prime Minister should be talking about today, rather than gimmicks and sticking plasters"". They added: ""The fact is that too often Conservative promises have amounted to window-dressing and bungs. ""There has been little effort to deliver long-term change for families and communities. ""No-one would turn down a lick of paint on the high street, but our communities deserve so much more"". Mr Johnson has been criticised for putting takeaway pints and al fresco dining at the heart of his plans - while not doing enough to tackle deep-rooted inequalities. The PM will give a major speech on his levelling up agenda on Thursday as he attempts to regain the narrative from Covid mixed messages and the football racism row. Senior Labour MPs, including Stephen Kinnock, Yvette Cooper and Carolyn Harris have formed a new group 'Renaissance' to help the party re-connect with voters it has lost over the last decade. They claim Mr Johnson's latest pledges will be ""hit by a wall of cynicism"" by voters who will struggle to make sense of ""meaningless soundbites"" after years of underinvestment. ""The PM expects us all to be grateful for promising small amounts of money to fill gaping holes brought about by Conservative failure, as if she should be thanking an arsonist for throwing a solitary bucket of water on a raging fire that he himself started,"" they write. And they single out the £4.8bn levelling up fund which has seen Tory areas - including Rishi Sunak's well-heeled constituency - handed money intended for struggling towns. The MPs argue that Labour's only route back to government is through re-building support in the constituencies that turned Conservative in 2019. More than 100 of Labour's 124 target seats for the next general lie outside the major cities. Ms Cooper said: ""Labour has lost support in many of the towns and communities where the party was forged over a century ago, and has too often been seen as a party only for the big cities in recent years. That has to change. ""Our towns aren't getting a fair deal from the Conservatives and have often been hard hit by Conservative policies over the last ten years. But Labour has much to do to earn people's support again."" In his speech in the West Midlands, the PM will insist that by addressing inequalities in some parts of the country, he will not be ""levelling down"" others. Many Tory MPs fear that Mr Johnson's focus on his new red-wall seats means that investment will be redirected from the traditional - and generally wealthier - Tory heartlands in the South. But he will say: ""Levelling up is not a jam-spreading operation. It's not robbing Peter to pay Paul. It's not zero sum, it's win win."" The Port Talbot steel works is the beating heart of our economy and community. We are committed to greening the steel-making process, but steelworkers must not pay the price. There has to be a fair and just transition that protects jobs and livelihoods, so that we de-carbonise without de-industrialising. This will require significant UK Government investment, and it is urgent if we are to meet our net zero targets. Our town centre in Ellesmere Port has faced years of decline accelerated by the pandemic. Levelling up for us would be investment in that town centre making it somewhere we want people to live work and play. Support from the Government on this would help restore community pride and economic opportunity. As long as we are denied projects which can attract investment into communities then we're not levelling up, we're playing catch-up. Rail electrification was promised by the Tories but it stopped in Cardiff and never came to Swansea. The tidal lagoon power plant would be a global first and would be revolutionary not only for Wales but for the world, and it's an opportunity that we keep getting denied.

Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has asked Transport for London to make face coverings compulsory on all its services after legal restrictions are lifted unless people are exempt. The Mirror has been told the transport body backs the plan - paving the way for mandatory face masks on the Tube, TfL trains, buses and taxis across the capital. Boris Johnson has urged the English public to continue covering their faces in ""crowded and enclosed spaces"" after his 'big bang' unlocking. But the PM is not prepared to keep legal restrictions in place - meaning the Government is reliant on enough members of the public putting the health of others first. Mr Khan said: ""I've repeatedly made clear that the simplest and safest option would have been for the Government to retain the national requirement for face coverings on public transport. ""I'm not prepared to stand by and put Londoners, and our city's recovery, at risk. ""This is why, after careful consideration, I have decided to ask TfL to retain the requirement for passengers to wear a face covering on all TfL services when the national regulations change."" He added: ""By keeping face masks mandatory we will give Londoners and visitors the reassurance and confidence to make the most of what our city has to offer, while also protecting our heroic transport workers and those who may be vulnerable and rely on the network to get around our city."" The Government faces growing calls to keep compulsory face masks on public transport after other major city leaders across England said they should remain. Leaders in Greater Manchester, the Liverpool City Region, Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Bristol are all understood to be in talks with private operators to encourage public use. In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon said face masks would stay in place even once other restrictions are lifted, telling the clinically vulnerable: ""We will not abandon you"". No domestic train operators or major bus and coach firms will require passengers to wear face coverings on services in England from Monday, according to industry bodies. Transport companies have the power to turn away customers who refuse to cover their noses and mouths even when the legal requirement is lifted. Cross-Channel train firm Eurostar and airlines such as British Airways, easyJet and Ryanair will continue to require passengers to wear face coverings from July 19. But train industry body the Rail Delivery Group announced that all domestic train operators, such as Avanti West Coast, TransPennine Express and Southeastern, will not go that far. And the Confederation of Passenger Transport, which represents major bus and coach operators such as National Express and Megabus, announced that its members will not mandate the wearing of face coverings from Monday. Around 3.8m clinically vulnerable people have been advised to avoid indoor spaces and meeting people who aren't double-jabbed, so ministers can ease face masks rules for others. A third of the UK population - including children - have not yet had a single jab and remain at risk of long Covid. A key scientific advisor has said that evidence suggests that calls to wear face masks ""probably won't do any good"" unless they are mandatory. Prof Graham Medley, chief modeller for the SAGE committee, said: ""There is evidence to suggest it does good, but only if everybody does it. ""Let's say 70% of people wear a mask, will that actually do any good because of the 30% who don't? ""I understand the Government's reluctance to actually mandate it. On the other hand, if it's not mandated it probably won't do any good."" The top scientists claimed that wearing a mask was a reasonable request of the public. ""I personally will wear a mask to protect other people,"" he said. ""It's quite a reasonable thing to do. It doesn't have a huge imposition in terms of economic impact or in terms of freedom."" Liverpool City Region mayor Steve Rotheram, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham and Bristol Mayor Marvyn Rees are all understood to be in talks with private local transport operators over face masks. Buses are deregulated in their regions so they are unable to order companies to keep them compulsory, even if the health of bus drivers and train conductors might be at risk. There are also complications with trains arriving in their patches from other parts of the country, which could lead to confusion and even public disorder. Mr Rotheram told the Mirror: ""Boris Johnson should have kept the requirement - and now can simply pass the buck when even greater exponential transmission rates occur."" Mr Burnham tweeted on Tuesday: ""Put yourself in the shoes of someone who is clinically vulnerable. ""Would you use public transport from Monday if there's only an ""expectation"" of masks being worn? I doubt it. ""By promising 'freedom day' for some, the Government could end up forcing millions of others to shield.""",Real Mirror,871.0

The Prime Minister is expected to announce on Monday that wearing a face covering will be optional in most settings in England. But there are fears that thousands of vulnerable people who can't have the jab, or the half of the population that hasn't had their second dose, could be put at risk. Some bus and train operators could still make wearing a mask a condition of carriage, even if they are no longer legally forced to do so. And health and scientific experts warned the plan ""makes no sense"" and could lead to more people becoming infected. Those travelling on public transport, shopping or visiting pubs, restaurants, cinemas and theatres would no longer have to wear masks by law. However, there is still expected to be guidance encouraging people to wear one in some enclosed places where they could come into close contact with others. And they are likely to remain obligatory in hospitals, GPs surgeries and care homes. The changes in face-mask rules are part of a broader lifting of restrictions on July 19 after which ministers have told people to use 'personal responsibility' instead. But city leaders in Greater Manchester and London have warned they could consider keeping masks on public transport to keep people safe. Andy Burnham, mayor of Greater Manchester, said that a more cautious approach was needed. ""I struggle to see how ministers can drop the requirement to wear masks on public transport without causing real problems for some people who are dependent on it."" he said. ""Those more vulnerable to infection or anxious about it will be put in a very unfair position."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan called on the government to maintain the requirement for facemasks on public transport. A spokesperson said: ""The Mayor has always been clear that face coverings have an important role to play both in giving Londoners confidence to travel on public transport, which will be crucial in our economic recovery, and as a tool to protect each other during this pandemic. ""Many millions of Londoners use both national rail services as well as TfL services to complete their journeys each day, making any divergence of rules across different modes of transport complex as well as confusing for passengers. ""Today the Mayor has had discussions with the TfL Commissioner, and both are clear that the simplest and safest option going forward would be for the Government to retain the requirement for face coverings on public transport. ""Should the Government lift the requirement for mandatory face coverings on public transport, TfL will have discussions with other train operating companies and the DfT about next steps and how to ensure passengers have the confidence to use public transport, which we know is a vital part of kickstarting London's economy and supporting businesses as we recover from this pandemic."" Transport for London boss Andy Byford hinted the capital could break ranks, adding: ""If Government advice is to drop masks, we will still take into account what our customers have said."" But City Hall sources in the capital suggested setting their own rules on masks would be difficult to implement in practice. Unite, which represents transport workers including bus drivers, said ending the requirement to wear face coverings on public transport would be ""an act of gross negligence"". The union's Bobby Morton said: ""Rates of infection are continuing to increase and not only does mask wearing reduce transmissions, it helps provide reassurance to drivers and to passengers who are nervous about using public transport. ""The idea of personal responsibility and hoping that people will wear masks is absolutely ridiculous. ""Members are already reporting there is an increase in passengers ignoring the rules on mask-wearing. ""Until rates of Covid-19 are fully under control throughout the whole of the UK, the rules on mask-wearing on public transport should remain in place"". The Scottish government has said there would be an ""ongoing need"" for face-coverings when all restrictions are lifted north of the border on August 9. Care minister Helen Whately was asked on the BBC if she would continue to wear a mask when commuting by train from her constituency of Faversham, Kent, to London. She replied: ""I think it's the sort of environment where, if something's crowded, I think I might."" Ms Whately added: ""I know personally, and I know others, aren't comfortable wearing masks all the time. ""As I've said, there are downsides to masks as there are downsides to many of the restrictions."" But health chiefs and scientists were concerned by the impact of the proposal to make masks optional. The chairman of the British Medical Association, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, said the Government's expected decision to let people choose for themselves ""makes no sense"" and would mean more people being infected.",Real Mirror,859.0
443,Real,The Mirror,"Sir Iain Duncan Smith, who helped steer through welfare cuts for six years before quitting in protest at them, is leading a pack of former DWP chiefs demanding the £20-a-week uplift is made permanent Six former Conservative work and pension secretaries have urged Chancellor Rishi Sunak to make the £20-a-week Universal Credit uplift permanent. The extra cash for benefit claimants was brought in as an emergency spending measure during the Covid crisis but is due to expire on October 11. Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith and five of his successors at the Department of Work and Pensions want to persuade the Treasury to stick with it even after restrictions are eased. The plea has also been signed by Stephen Crabb, Damian Green, David Gauke, Esther McVey and Amber Rudd. Sir Iain, the architect of UC, said: ""One of the greatest, but unremarked, successes of the Government's response to Covid has been the benefit system. ""Universal Credit has held up well as a system for distributing money to those who need it, and the extra £20 added to has been essential in allowing people to live with dignity."" He warned that a failure to keep the uplift permanently in place would ""damage living standards, health and opportunities"" for families that needed it most. The weekly top-up has spared hundreds of thousands of families from destitution during the pandemic. Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey is believed to be want to keep the £20 uplift permanently - but discussions with the Treasury are ongoing. Ministers told the Commons last week that there will be less need for the uplift after Covid restrictions are scrapped. Tory ministers are for now storming ahead with a cut - despite admitting they've made no assessment of how many kids it will hurl into poverty. Dozens of Tory MPs who called for a temporary uplift for 6million claimants to be made permanent have had their pleas dismissed by the Treasury, the Mirror understands. And Minister Will Quince last week confirmed his ""expectation"" is the boost, brought in due to Covid last April, ""will end once our economy has opened"". He dismissed estimates that the cut, planned for September, will pull 400,000 people below the poverty line as ""purely speculative"". He confirmed ""no assessment has been made"" by the government of how the change will affect child poverty in Scotland. And asked if he'd made a similar assessment across the UK, he said: ""Any look at measures of that kind are purely speculative in terms of forecasting."" Mr Quince claimed: ""Projecting the impact of an individual policy on poverty levels is complex and inherently speculative. ""It is very difficult to isolate the specific impact of one policy and determine its effect on how many people fall below the poverty threshold, which changes over time."" But Labour's Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Reynolds demanded the Tories ""cancel that cut"". SNP MP Kirsten Oswald added: ""Ploughing ahead with the scheduled cut to Universal Credit means ignoring the advice of three select committees…. over 100 Tory MPs, former Tory minister Lord Freud and over 50 anti-poverty charities.",Real Mirror,519.0
444,Real,The Mirror,"Conservative MPs have threatened to vote against the Building Safety Bill, published today, unless it protects leaseholders from being billed for fire safety works Boris Johnson is under pressure to protect homeowners from colossal building remediation costs post-Grenfell or risk a Commons rebellion. Tory MPs have threatened to vote against his Building Safety Bill, published today, unless it includes safeguards to ensure leaseholders cannot be billed for fire and building safety works. More than four years on from the Grenfell tragedy thousands of home-owners are still facing stress and financial ruin because they live in unsafe buildings which they are unable to sell. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick has confirmed they will be given double the amount of time to go after builders and developers who carried out shoddy work on their properties. The Government will change the law to give home-owners 15 years - up from six - to take action against rogue developers. Mr Jenrick will also today set out plans for a new Building Safety Regulator which he says will give residents more power and toughen sanctions against builders and developers who have put their safety at risk. The new body will be responsible for ensuring that any building safety risks in new and existing residential buildings of 18m and above are resolved, taking costs into account. This will include making sure that safety is considered at key stages of the design, construction and completion phases. But shadow Housing Secretary Lucy Powell said the Government's response will ""bring little relief"" to homeowners trapped in unsellable homes. Labour wants the Government to establish a building works agency to assess, fix, find and certify every building in the wake of Grenfell, in which 72 people lost their lives. They have also argued that leaseholders should be protected from additional costs - and are backed by dozens of Tory MPs on the issue. Ms Powell said: ""Hundreds of thousands of innocent homeowners and tenants are suffering unbelievable pressure as a result of the Government's failure on cladding. ""Their approach so far has been marked by inertia and spiralling costs, with people trapped in unsafe, unsellable homes, facing unaffordable, unjust costs through no fault of their own. ""If ministers do not legislate to safeguard leaseholders livelihoods, we will build on the big cross-party consensus from the Fire Safety Act rebellions to defeat the Government and protect homeowners from colossal costs."" Mr Jenrick said that 70% of the 469 buildings identified with the dangerous cladding have now had it removed - with the rest to be finished by the end of the year.",Real Mirror,430.0
445,Real,The Mirror,"Boris Johnson will announce the end of a majority of coronavirus restrictions at a 5pm press conference as part of his plans to ""restore people's freedoms"" in England on July 19 People must ""exercise judgement"" when Covid restrictions such as wearing face masks and social distancing are scrapped from July 19, Boris Johnson has said. The Prime Minister will today confirm his plans to ""restore people's freedoms"" with the majority of restrictions in England abolished. He will give a 5pm press conference at the same time as Health Secretary Sajid Javid updates MPs in the Commons. Ministers have concluded the vaccination roll-out has dramatically cut the numbers suffering serious illness or death. But scientists have urged caution amid soaring case rates across the country. The British Medical Association warned the rise was ""alarming"" and it made ""no sense"" to remove all restrictions at the same time. There were a further 24,248 Covid cases and 15 deaths on Sunday, and while hospital admissions from the virus are low, they have more than doubled in a week. Mr Johnson admitted the number of cases are expected to rise further once restrictions are lifted. At a Downing Street press conference this afternoon, the PM is set to announce the one-metre social distancing rule and the legal requirement to wear face-masks will be scrapped. He will signal that formal advice to work from home will end and set out the next steps for care home visits. The Government will also publish the findings of reviews into social distancing and vaccine passports. Although the PM's formal confirmation of the plans will come on July 12, Downing Street wants to give the public and businesses more time to prepare for unlocking. Mr Johnson said: ""Thanks to the successful rollout of our vaccination programme, we are progressing cautiously through our roadmap. ""Today we will set out how we can restore people's freedoms when we reach step 4. ""But I must stress that the pandemic is not over and that cases will continue to rise over the coming weeks. ""As we begin to learn to live with this virus, we must all continue to carefully manage the risks from Covid and exercise judgement when going about our lives."" The PM will call for more people to get their second dose before July 19 to offer them the highest protection as cases surge. Over 78 million vaccine doses have now been administered in the UK, and 63.4% of adults have received two doses. The PM's bullish approach represents a shift from the relative caution of recent months when he delayed the final step out of lockdown by four weeks. Cabinet minister Robert Jenrick said the Government was now in a position to ""roll back"" restrictions in England and ""return to normality"" as far as possible. He stressed that individuals should take personal responsibility to protect themselves - even though it could lead to conflict with others. ""It will be a different period where we as private citizens make these judgements rather than the Government telling you what to do,"" he said. He joined Chancellor Rishi Sunak in suggesting he would stop wearing a face mask as soon as he was permitted to do so. ""I don't particularly want to wear a mask. I don't think a lot of people enjoy doing it,"" he added. Mr Johnson is expected to announce that on July 19 mask-wearing will become voluntary everywhere apart from hospitals, GPs surgeries and care homes. Proposed new rules mean those travelling on public transport, shopping or visiting pubs, restaurants, cinemas and theatres would no longer have to wear them by law. But there is still expected to be guidance encouraging people to wear one in some enclosed places where people come into close contact with each other. The one-metre plus rule in bars and restaurants will end, meaning a return to drinking and ordering a pint at the bar. Customers will no longer be required to sign in using a QR code or to write down their personal details - although pubs will still be allowed to ask them. The Test and Trace app will continue to operate alerting people if they have come into close contact with somebody who has tested positive with the virus. The PM is also expected to confirm that the double-jabbed will no longer have to self-isolate if they have come into contact with a positive case. But those who test positive themselves will still have to quarantine for 10 days at home. Holidaymakers who have had two jabs returning from amber list countries like Spain and Greece could avoid having to self-isolate. However, officials are thrashing out the details, including whether children can travel with their vaccinated parents. And British tourists would still have to follow the rules in their holiday hotspots. The Government is pressing ahead with plans to scrap school bubbles, replacing them with regular testing instead, to prevent so many children missing school from September. Mass events, including festivals, will also be allowed under the proposals for the final step out of lockdown. It means going to live music, theatre and nightclubs will be back on, after almost 18 months of large events being banned.",Real Mirror,867.0
446,Real,The Mirror,"Boris Johnson is said to be “actively considering” giving backbenchers a say on the proposal to slash foreign aid by £4billion, from 0.7 per cent to 0.5 per cent of gross national income Boris Johnson is being urged to perform a U-turn and give rebellious Tory MPs a binding vote on his plan to slash foreign aid. The Prime Minister is said to be ""actively considering"" giving backbenchers a say on the proposal. It comes amid warnings from his own side that starving the world's poorest people of cash would see the Tories thought of by voters as the ""Nasty Party"" once again. Around 50 Conservative MPs, including ex-PM Theresa May, are against the £4billion cut, from 0.7 per cent to 0.5 per cent of gross national income. They believe it will put lives at risk in some of the most desperate countries on the planet. It would also irreversibly damage the UK's influence and standing on the world stage, they argue. Ruth Davidson, former leader of the Scottish Conservatives, warned the PM the commitment to the 0.7 per cent target ""runs deep"". The top Tory said that without a vote MPs would join the ""rising chorus of outcry"" at horrific pictures of the unfolding famine in Ethiopia, as well as crises in Yemen and Syria. She added: ""It really does risk us being transported back to being thought of as the 'Nasty Party in peoples' minds."" Rebel Tories failed to embarrass the PM into a formal vote on the matter in the week he hosted G7 leaders in Cornwall. They are now urging him to table one before Parliament breaks for summer at the end of this month. Reports suggest Mr Johnson has been advised to grant their wish or risk them bringing forward another damaging rebel amendment. Anthony Mangnall, MP for Totnes in Devon, said the rumbling row was causing anger in even the safest of Tory seats. ""Voters in the South can't be taken for granted,"" Mr Mangnall warned the PM. ""On planning reforms, on overseas aid and on a zero-sum interpretation of the levelling-up agenda, we ignore our own heartlands at our peril. ""Knocking down the Red Wall, only to allow the cultivation of a Yellow Hedge, isn't smart politics."" Ex-Cabinet minister Karen Bradley added: ""The Government can't take backbenchers for granted, even with an 80-seat majority.""

Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: ""We are willing to look at how we fund it, including looking at what taxes may be needed to pay for it."" Thousands of elderly people face crippling bills to pay for care, with many forced to sell their homes. Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised he had a plan to fix the social crisis ""once and for all"" as he took office in 2019. Downing Street says work on the plan is ongoing but has refused to reveal any details or confirm when they would be published. No10 has also suggested other parties would only become involved after the Tory plan was published – despite Mr Johnson promising cross-party talks would be held. New Health Secretary Sajid Javid is said to be open to raising tax to pay for major social care reform. He is set to play a critical role in brokering an end to the stand-off between No 10 and the Treasury over how any solution would be funded. Reforms proposed a decade ago by Sir Andrew Dilnot, capping lifetime care costs and raising the threshold at which the state steps in, remain the PM's preference. The Treasury is thought to be frustrated at No10 for rejecting tax-rise proposals to cover the money needed – up to £10billion. Any tax rise is expected to face a backlash from Tory backbenchers. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Ms Reeves said: ""I have been in my job for two months and it is high on my list of things that have got to be sorted and explained ahead of the next election. She added: ""When Boris Johnson became Prime Minister he said that we have a plan for social care that is already prepared. Well where is it? ""The people of this country, people in social care have been so badly treated by this Government over the last year and they are owed something better than what this Government have delivered."" Ms Reeves blamed Labour's failure to produce a proper plan for social care while in Government on the Conservatives' decision to walk out on cross-party talks. ""Talks have never restarted in the 11 years since the Conservatives took office that shows, I think, the neglect and the failure under this Conservative Government,"" she said. Ms Reeves said she is prepared to consider tax rises to pay for a publicly-funded national social care service. She added: ""We are willing to look at how you fund it because taxes may need to pay for it. ""As shadow chancellor, and I hope in the future as chancellor, I will make sure that any policies that I set out and that Labour set out will be fully costed and we explained how they will be paid for.

448,Real,The Mirror,"Ministers are under pressure to explain why Gina Coladangelo had access to Parliament when she had no official role Disgraced former health secretary Matt Hancock is facing fresh questions over parliamentary passes granted to his lover. Reports today suggest that Gina Coladangelo had a House of Commons pass through his office from June 2019 to February 2020. Sources told the Observer that she began advising Mr Hancock in an unpaid capacity in early 2020. That was months before Mr Hancock handed his old university friend a £15,000-a-year role as a non-executive director at the Department of Health last September. Under Parliamentary rules, any additional job must be listed if it ""is in any way advantaged by the privileged access to parliament afforded by your pass"". At the time, her only declared work was as marketing and communications director at Oliver Bonas, the retailer founded by her husband, Oliver Tress. The previous year she had helped him with his failed leadership bid. Mr Hancock was forced to quit last weekend after CCTV emerged of him kissing Ms Coladangelo in his office in breach of social distancing rules. The top Tory already faces questions over why his lover was subsequently given a pass through the office of Lord Bethell, a health minister who donated to Hancock's leadership campaign. Guidance around the sponsoring of passes states that they should only be awarded to those ""requiring access to the Parliamentary estate to undertake work"". Lord Bethell today wrote to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, who has been asked to investigate, claiming Ms Coladangelo gave him unpaid support. But he declined to give any evidence of the work she actually did for him. There was further mystery over her role after it was claimed she was at mMr Hancock's side when he threw an 'intimate' drinks party in July 2019. The Mail on Sunday reported how the couple 'held court' at the event in his large office at the Department of Health. Mr Hancock also faces claims that he asked people to ""call me the Minister for Hugs"" just a few days after the fateful embrace, but before it was exposed. He allegedly cracked the cringeworthy joke as he prepared for a TV interview on May 17 about the loosening of Covid restrictions, which permitted 'cautious cuddles'. Mr Hancock's office did not respond to requests for comment. Labour party chair Anneliese Dodds called on new Health Secretary Sajid Javid to explain his colleagues' actions. ""Why was Gina Coladangelo granted the right to enter Parliament unchecked when he launched his bid to become their leader?"" she asked. ""What work did she do for him in Parliament?

The Greater Manchester Mayor admitted he would return to Westminster to run for the Labour leadership ""if there was a moment where that was right"". But with Mr Starmer facing an internal revolt if Labour loses Batley and Spen, a West Yorkshire seat it has held since 1997, his timing will be regarded by some as unhelpful. Mr Burnham's comments come as a YouGov poll suggested that 69% of Labour members would prefer him as leader, despite him no longer being an MP. But Mr Starmer has insisted he has no plans to quit if Labour loses the crucial by-election, where Kim Leadbeater, the sister of murdered MP Jo Cox, is standing. On the eve of the vote that threatens to throw the party into further turmoil, the Labour leader's spokesman claimed he had a ""four-year plan"" to lead his party back to power. Mr Burnham, dubbed the King of the North, told the New Statesman magazine: ""I get asked it relentlessly: would I ever go back? So the answer is, I would, but it's not any time soon. ""I'm supporting Keir – I want him to win the next general election, and I will do whatever I can to help him achieve that."" Mr Burnham, re-elected as Mayor of Greater Manchester just last month, admitted he had ""some"" personal ambition but insisted that there were bigger issues at play. He added: ""If there was a moment where that was right, then I've indicated that I would be prepared to go back. ""But I wouldn't put the old suit back on – it would be to go back as something different."" His comments came after 41% of members in a YouGov poll said they would want Mr Starmer to stand down and make way for fresh leadership if Batley and Spen is lost. But 48% would back him to remain in place regardless, according to the survey of 871 members conducted over the past week.

Spain, Portugal and Malta are among tourist hotspots toughening up entry requirements for Brits as infections here soar. The number of new cases of Covid 19 reported rose to 22,868 yesterday, the highest levels since the height of the second wave in January. But as the vaccine roll-out continues the number of deaths linked to the virus has plummeted and new hospitalisation data is due today. New health secretary Sajid Javid was bullish about normal life resuming on July 19: ""It's going to be irreversible. There's no going back"". But some Department of Health officials are ""livid"" about Mr Javid's confidence, warning it undermines their ""data not dates"" policy and preparations for the winter. More immediately, Brits' plans for foreign holidays this summer looked set to be derailed unless they have been double jabbed in time. Spain, the most popular destination for Brits, said from later this week travellers would need to prove they were fully vaccinated, or provide a negative PCR test on arrival if aged 12 or over. Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez said the UK's Covid figures were ""worrying"" because the accumulated 14-day rate was ""well above 150 cases per 100,000 inhabitants."" The move comes just days after the UK announced it was putting the Balearic Islands on the green list, although not mainland Spain. Portugal yesterday threw family holidays into doubt by imposing a 14-day quarantine on UK arrivals who have not had both jabs - including children aged 12 and over. Malta imposed 14-day quarantine on unvaccinated Brits, including teenagers, just hours after being added to the UK green list. Italy has demanded Brits self-isolate for five days and provide a negative Covid test. Other European travel hotspots could follow suit in beefing up entry restrictions. German Chancellor Angela Merkel attempted to ban British travellers from the EU regardless of whether or not they have had the vaccine. She wants to designate the UK a ""country of concern"" because of the widespread Delta variant. She has been backed by French President Emmanuel Macron who wants EU states to take a common position on the UK to prevent a surge of the Delta variant. Hong Kong has put the UK on its ""very high risk"" list with all passenger flights from the UK banned from July 1. Boris Johnson is due to meet Mrs Merkel on Friday at Chequers, where he is expected to push for a deal to safely open up foreign travel. The Government has signalled that fully vaccinated Brits will be able to travel to amber list countries without having to quarantine on their return, possibly from August. EU officials claimed that negotiations were ""going well"" for the UK to take part in the EU's green certification scheme, which allows people to travel freely across the continent with proof of vaccinations or test results. Downing Street said it was up to individual countries what rules they imposed for British travellers. ""We will continue to work directly with individual countries about what requirements they may introduce for UK citizens,"" the PM's spokesman said. But while travel abroad looked more remote, the new health secretary confirmed plans for domestic restrictions to be lifted on July 19. Mr Javid told MPs there was ""no reason"" why normal life could not resume when step 4 was lifted, with the requirement for face-masks and social distancing expected to be dropped. And he resisted pressure from sceptical MPs to ease restrictions next week on July 5. He said: ""While we decided not to bring forward step 4, we see no reason to go beyond July 19, because, in truth, no date we choose comes with zero risk from Covid. ""We know we cannot simply eliminate it, we have to learn to live with it"". Boris Johnson said he believed the ""terminus date"" would mean going ""back to life as it was before Covid as far as possible"". But shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said: ""I remember being told 'there was nothing in the data' to suggest June 21 would not go ahead. ""I remember children returning to school for one day before the January lockdown was imposed."" He added: ""I want to see an end to restrictions end. Our constituents want it.

No 10 insiders claim that aides were forced to persuade the Prime Minister that visiting the Monarch, then 93, could put her life at risk. The danger of the virus to the elderly was already well known and on March 18, 2020, the day of the scheduled meeting, there were already 2,626 cases of Covid across the UK. Just over a week later, on March 27, Mr Johnson tested positive for Covid, ending up battling the deadly disease in hospital. The royal audience, which was due to have been face-to-face at Buckingham Palace, eventually took place over the phone instead. No 10 denies that Mr Johnson attempted to see the Queen face-to-face. A spokeswoman said: ""This is completely untrue"". But two separate sources told the Mirror the PM had been intent on attending the Palace in person. One said: ""He was pressing advisors to allow him to go and see the Queen and told private office that was his intention. ""This was despite the increasing levels of Covid and the risk that would come along with such a visit. ""Eventually he saw reason when he was asked firmly by a senior advisor if he could imagine the reaction if he was responsible for the death of the Queen. ""At that point his face went ashen and he scurried back into his office muttering about the whole thing being ridiculous. No more was said about it"". A second insider confirmed the account. The following day the Queen travelled to Windsor where she spent the first lockdown, along with Prince Philip and a small 'bubble' of key staff. Later on March 18 last year, the PM warned the country at a press conference that he was prepared to take ""further and faster measures"" to tackle the virus. The Government had already urged people to stay at home - and ministers were also considering putting London into lockdown. Mr Johnson held his first in-person weekly audience with the Queen in 15 months on Wednesday. The Monarch revealed that she had been following the woes of Health Secretary Matt Hancock who she described a ""poor man"". Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said: ""This is yet more evidence of how from the very start of this pandemic right through to the current Delta variant spike, Boris Johnson 's reckless and cavalier attitude is the reason why we have the worst death toll in Europe.""",Real Mirror,453.0
454,Real,The Mirror,"Wednesday marks exactly five years on from the Brexit referendum and the country is still torn over our exit from the EU. A new poll finds that if the vote was re-run now the result would be a narrow win for Remain – by 51% to 49% Five years on from the Brexit referendum which upended British politics the country remains divided over whether leaving the EU was worth it. After years of parliamentary wrangling many felt relief that the UK finally left Brussels' orbit on January 30, 2020. But others continued to rail against the move - even mooting rejoining the EU in future. A poll by Savanta ComRes on Wednesday finds that if the referendum was re-run now the result would be a narrow win for Remain - by 51% to 49%. The actual result on June 23, 2016 was 51.9% for Leave and 48.1% for Remain. After major developments including two general elections, Brexit deals and the pandemic since 2016, around a third of respondents - 31% - said Brexit had been a success, while slightly more - 34% - regarded it as a failure. More than half - 51% - said it had left the country more divided with just 13% who thought it was more united. While many of the changes over the last six months have been overshadowed by the Covid pandemic, the UK's departure has led to fundamental shifts. We have more freedom over trade, immigration and our own laws - but Brits are no longer entitled to freedom of movement in the EU and face more expensive imports and the loss of trade. The long-term future of the Union also appears to be at stake - with Remain-voting Scotland weighing up independence and Northern Ireland gripped by the post-Brexit fall-out. Marking the anniversary of the vote, Boris Johnson said: ""Five years ago the British people made the momentous decision to leave the European Union and take back control of our destiny. ""This Government got Brexit done and we've already reclaimed our money, laws, borders and waters."" He added: ""The decision to leave the EU may now part of our history, but our clear mission is to utilise the freedoms it brings to shape a better future for our people."" It's now almost six months since we left the single market and customs union, the ""real"" Brexit that we avoided in 2020 due to the transition period. Here we examine the key shifts since that fateful June day in 2016. While Covid travel restrictions have meant that few people have been abroad since Brexit, free movement has come to an end. It means that UK nationals will only be able to travel without a visa to the EU for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. When you can travel again, you'll have to use separate lanes at passport control. And while Covid restrictions continue, UK citizens don't have the freedom to travel around the EU for holidays that member states do. You'll need travel insurance with health cover, even though the EHIC card will be replaced with a new scheme in future. And check your mobile phone charges as guaranteed free data roaming has ended. The pet passport scheme no longer applies. But duty-free shopping when you're travelling to and from the EU will return - and you can bring 18 litres of wine and 42 litres of beer. EU citizens in the UK can remain here with the same rights until next Wednesday - but after will be issued with a 28-day ultimatum to apply for settled status. More than 4.5m have already been granted this - but around 300,000 applications have not yet been processed putting their right to rent a home, work or retire here at risk. There is a new points-based immigration system for foreign citizens wanting to move to the UK - and they'll have to pay for a visa costing up to £1,400 per person. They'll also have to pay a health surcharge of £624 a year unless they are health workers. Businesses - including in hospitality, retail and the building trade - have warned they are already struggling to find staff while the NHS is also heavily reliant on foreign workers. Boris Johnson did in the end manage to get a Free Trade Agreement with Brussels - with no new tariffs or quotas on more than £600bn a year in trade between us and the Continent. But traders have complained about huge amounts of new paperwork. Some products - such as plants, live animals and some foods - need special certificates. Full customs checks on imported goods kick in at the end of June. You also have to pay VAT on gifts worth more than £39 on arrival. But the UK can now negotiate its own trade deals - and last week completed its first with Australia. It's tiny - representing just 0.025% of GDP for 15 years - but ministers say it's a ""stepping stone"" to more trade with the Pacific region. The big prize would be a US trade deal - although it's unclear British consumers would accept American standards on food and animal welfare.",Real Mirror,863.0
455,Real,The Mirror,"EXCLUSIVE Director of Communications Ben Nunn, who has worked for the Labour leader since 2016, said he was quitting to pursue other projects. One of Keir Starmer closest aides has told Labour Party staff that he is stepping down. Director of Communications Ben Nunn, who has worked for the Labour leader since 2016, said he was quitting to pursue other projects. The departure of such a loyal figure will be a blow to the Labour leader at a time he has struggled to set out the party's vision and slumped in the polls. But Mr Nunn told Labour staff that he remains ""as convinced today as I ever have been"" that Mr Starmer would make it to No 10 and be a ""great"" Prime Minister. The Mirror understands that the 33-year-old advisor is leaving on good terms with the Labour leader who has left the door open to his return in future. Paul Ovenden, Keir Starmer's deputy communications director, is also stepping down. Labour insiders said that this was as a result of family reasons, rather than political events. Mr Starmer faces calls to bolster his position by bringing in more experience to his top team, as well as shaking up his shadow Cabinet and setting out more detail on policy. Labour suffered its worst ever by-election result today in Chesham & Amersham, where the party was pushed into fourth place on just 1.6% of the vote. Labour insiders have suggested Mr Starmer could face a leadership challenge if the party loses the Batley and Spen by-election later this month, in the wake of its devastating defeat in Hartlepool and the chaotic reshuffle which saw him sack, then promote, deputy leader Angie Rayner. But his allies insist he has no plans to go anywhere and is committed to seeing through the changes he began when he took over the party last year. In his departure email to staff, Mr Nunn wrote: ""I remain as convinced today as I ever have been that he will be a great Prime Minister and make this a better, stronger, more prosperous country. ""The decision to step down has been one of the most difficult decisions I've ever had to take."" He added: ""I've worked in politics for about six years now and in that time I've worked through the junior doctors' dispute, EU referendum campaign, a leadership contest, Brexit, a general election, another leadership contest and a global pandemic. ""I've had the opportunity to learn and experience so much. Now is the chance for me to go forward and do something different."" Mr Nunn, who previously worked in the health and charity sectors, joined Mr Starmer's shadow Brexit team in 2016 from Owen Smith's doomed leadership bid against Jeremy Corbyn. He quickly impressed party chiefs and became a respected and trusted figure with both MPs and the Westminster media, rising to the top communications job when Mr Starmer became leader. The popular aide was one of the ""gang of five"" compromising Mr Starmer's inner circle, also including chief of staff Morgan McSweeney, his deputy Chris Ward, political secretary Jenny Chapman and policy chief Clare Ainsley. One shadow cabinet minister told the Mirror: ""Ben has done a remarkable job doing comms for Keir when we've been stuck inside for more than a year. ""Communicating the need for the circuit break, some decent party political broadcasts and the Piers Morgan interview where we saw some of the real Keir were all down to Ben.""",Real Mirror,578.0
456,Real,The Mirror,"Home Secretary Priti Patel and Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said they were ""deeply ashamed"" in the downward trend in convictions The Government has apologised for ""failing"" rape victims over years of plunging conviction levels and vowed to try to finally boost rates. Home Secretary Priti Patel and Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said they were ""deeply ashamed"" in the downward trend in bringing offenders to justice. The latest official figures for 2019-20 show 1,439 suspects were convicted of rape or lesser offences in England and Wales last year - the lowest level since records began. It was also down from 1,925 the previous year, despite reports of adult rape to police almost doubling since 2015-16. There are an estimated 128,000 victims of rape and attempted rape a year, but only 1.6% of reported cases results in a charge. The ministers set out plans for a ""system and culture change"" which will include focusing more on the behaviour of the suspect than the accuser. They cited a raft of measures to boost the volume of allegations referred by the police to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), the number of suspects charged, and the amount of cases reaching court return to 2016 levels by the end of this Parliament. Measures include a pilot scheme aimed at reducing cross-examination of victims in court by conducting pre-recorded interviews, a nationwide recognition that only evidence about the complainant that is pertinent to the case should be used, and a new approach to investigations to assess suspect behaviour and offending patterns. The review, which was commissioned more than two years ago, said: ""The current situation is totally unacceptable and the Government is determined to change it: we owe this to every victim and are extremely sorry that the system has reached this point."" The ministers added: ""These are trends of which we are deeply ashamed. Victims of rape are being failed. Thousands of victims have gone without justice. But this isn't just about numbers - every instance involves a real person who has suffered a truly terrible crime."" Max Hill QC, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said: ""The stark drop in the number of cases that have gone before a jury in recent years means too few victims are seeing justice and reversing that is an absolute priority for the CPS. ""This review presents an unprecedented opportunity across the whole criminal justice system, and I am determined to lead meaningful and lasting change in every aspect of how these cases are handled, in partnership with the police and the courts.""",Real Mirror,423.0

The Tory peer announced that she was going for the top job which becomes vacant when Sir Simon Stevens stands down at the end of July. Baroness Harding was appointed by Health Secretary Matt Hancock without competition to head the Test and Trace system during the pandemic, which she did until April. The scheme has come in for criticism over the course of the pandemic, with the Commons Public Accounts committee saying earlier this year that there was ""no clear evidence"" it contributed to a reduction in infection levels. The post is more powerful than most Cabinet ministers with a £130bn annual budget and 1.5 million employees. The peer, who has temporarily stepped aside as chair of NHS Improvement, would be a controversial appointment because of her Tory links and lack of hospital experience. According to NHS England, the chief executive salary was between £195,000 and £200,000 last year but Sir Simon voluntarily taken a £20,000 pay cut for the sixth year in a row.

Professor Stephen Reicher, a member of the Spi-B group of behavioural scientists, claimed that financial support for those forced to self-isolate was ""virtually the worst in the world"". The Government's own officials have accused it of hiding a method for self-isolating Brits to get cash, leaked e-mails claim today. Civil servants believed staff who are forced to self-isolate could switch temporarily onto the furlough scheme - getting up to 80% of their usual pay. But the Treasury did not want this to happen, because furlough was not designed to cover people who were self-isolating due to Covid-19. So rather than advertising this option, the Government is accused of suppressing it, according to emails leaked to Politico. Official guidance publicly discouraged self-isolating people from claiming furlough, saying: ""The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme is not intended for short term absences from work due to sickness. Short term illness or self-isolation should not be a consideration when deciding if you'll be furloughed."" Statutory sick pay is worth just £96.35 a week and is unavailable to part-time workers on low hours. Prof Reicher added: ""We shouldn't have been in this position if we'd acted properly and if we'd had proper safeguards to our borders, if we'd had proper support for people to self-isolate, and so on, I don't think we would have been in this position."" He claimed that ""sick pay"" in the UK was, apart from the United States, ""virtually the worst in the world"" and that ""only about 50% of people are self-isolating"". He added: ""It's not only about payment, it's also about other forms of support,"" he said. Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Bridget Phillipson said: ""These revelations are shocking. ""The government were advised time and time again how crucial a proper self-isolation system is for curbing the spread of infection, and protecting people's lives and livelihoods. ""It is shameful and reckless that the Chancellor ignored professional advice and put countless people and workplaces at unnecessary risk when he had the opportunity to help."" A Treasury spokeswoman said: ""We have an extensive support package in place for those self-isolating due to coronavirus including £500 one off payments for those on low incomes. ""Our furlough scheme has saved millions of jobs, helping families who otherwise would have been out of work – and we have spent £65 billion pounds on this to date. In working up the detail of the scheme we had to balance the need to get help out to people quickly while minimising the risk of fraud and protecting taxpayers' money from abuse. ""Our guidance on furlough has always been clear that employees can be furloughed according to business need and that the scheme can be used for individuals who are clinically extremely vulnerable or at high risk of severe illness from coronavirus.""",Real Mirror,514.0

The Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee warned the proposals to create growth, renewal or protected zones left them ""unpersuaded"". They claimed the plans did not contain enough detail and it was unclear whether they will produce a cheaper, quicker or more democratic planning system. In the biggest shake-up to planning rules in more than 70 years ministers want to simplify planning so that homes and infrastructure can be delivered more quickly across England. Land designated for new homes, hospitals, schools, shops and offices will get automatic permission for firms to start building.

But the simplification of the rules would make it more difficult for existing homeowners to block new housing schemes. MPs urged the Government to revisit the proposals - and asked for more information on how the target to build 300,000 homes a year will be reached. They want councils to have more powers to act where developers are too slow in completing sites they have planning permission for. This could include levying full council tax charges on incomplete properties if sufficient progress has not been made within 36 months. Committee chair Clive Betts said: ""The Government's aim of developing a planning system that enables buildings to be built more quickly and with greater input from local communities is welcome, but it is far from clear how the current proposals will achieve this.

Brexit minister Lord Frost accused the EU of adopting an ""extremely purist"" approach to the Northern Ireland Protocol signed up to by the PM to prevent a hard border. He insisted there is still time to reach an agreement before the current grace period for chilled meats ends but the UK will consider ""all options"" if it proves impossible.

Ex-PM Theresa May warned the plan would have a ""devastating impact"" on the world's poorest people and do serious ""damage"" to Britain's international reputation.

A new workers' rights watchdog is today being set up by Government to bring together existing bodies to blow the whistle on bad bosses. But union chiefs accused ministers of failing to do enough to tackle Britain's urgent insecure work and enforcement crises. The TUC said the body was ""heavy and spin, but light on action"" as there were no plans to legislate or new funding available. The announcement comes just months after ministers were forced to rip up plans to look again at the 48-hour working week cap and rules for factoring overtime into holiday pay. Ministers say that bringing together existing bodies into a ""one stop shop"" will improve enforcement and ensure workers know where to go for advice and support. The new body will take over responsibility for enforcing the rules on modern slavery, the minimum wage and protecting agency workers. It will get new powers to help vulnerable workers get the holiday pay and statutory sick pay they are entitled to – without having to go through a lengthy employment tribunal. Shadow Employment rights minister Andy McDonald said: ""The Conservatives have spent the last decade undermining workers' rights, cutting funding for enforcement bodies and failing to keep people safe at work during the pandemic. ""On their watch, insecure employment in the gig economy has spiralled and fire and rehire has become commonplace, while the long-promised Employment Bill has been ditched. ""Without outlawing fire and rehire and strengthening employment rights, this announcement falls well short of providing all workers with the decent and secure employment they deserve."" Business minister Paul Scully said: ""The vast majority of businesses want to do right by their staff, but there are a minority who seem to think the law doesn't apply to them. ""This new workers' watchdog will help us crack down on any abuses of workers' rights and take action against companies that turn a blind eye to abuses in their supply chains. ""They will provide a one-stop shop for employees and businesses wanting to understand their rights and obligations."" The Government will also consider measures to target abuses in the clothes manufacturing sector amid scrutiny of the industry following revelations about workers' poor conditions. Harsher measures for companies that fail to improve include bans on goods made in factories were workers have been underpaid. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect at work. ""But years of underinvestment have left our enforcement system in crisis and millions of workers vulnerable to exploitation. ""Today's announcement is heavy on spin, but light on action. Rather than clamping down on bad bosses now, the Government is today making an announcement with no plan to legislate to make it happen – and no new funding either."" She added: ""This pandemic has brutally exposed the terrible working conditions and insecurity many people in Britain face. This announcement will do little to change that."" Last month ministers disappointed thousands of workers by failing to announce a long-promised employment bill in the Queen's Speech.

466,Real,The Mirror,"Tory rebels are trying to force the Prime Minister to maintain a manifesto commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income on help for the world's poorest Boris Johnson faces a humiliating defeat at the hands of his own MPs over foreign aid cuts just days before hosting the G7 summit. Tory rebels are trying to force the Prime Minister to maintain a manifesto commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income on help for the world's poorest. Tomorrow's Commons vote will not be legally binding but the group hopes it will pile pressure on the PM to stick to his promise when the eyes of the world are on him. Britain is the only G7 nation planning to cut foreign aid this year during the global Covid pandemic. Mr Johnson decided to break his promise to voters and slash aid spending to 0.5% - a cut of around £4 billion - amid the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. The PM was spared an embarrassing Tory revolt today after a plan to force him to make up the cash cut from the foreign aid budget from a pot for a new research agency failed. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle thwarted the rebels' efforts when he decided that their amendment was not relevant to the bill. However, he rebuked ministers for not allowing a vote - which the MPs tomorrow. His deputy Nigel Evans told MPs that the Speaker was ""satisfied"" that the issue was an appropriate topic for the urgent three-hour debate. Former international aid secretary Andrew Mitchell, who led the rebellion, warned global health funding would be cut by 14%, HIV funding by 18%, and support for girls education by 25%. He added: ""None of this should go ahead without the matter being considered by the House."" Earlier, he told MPs: ""The Government front bench is treating the House of Commons with disrespect. ""They are avoiding a vote on the commitments that each of us made individually and collectively at the last general election, on a promise made internationally. ""In the opinion of some of Britain's leading lawyers the Government is acting unlawfully."" Mr Mitchell added: ""In the week of the British chairmanship of the G7, the Government's failure to address this issue will indisputably mean that hundreds of thousands of avoidable deaths will result."" Senior Tory David Davis warned the Government risks the UK losing influence on the world stage when other leading powers are increasing aid spending. ""We're throwing away enormous influence, particularly in Africa where there's a great ideological battle with China,"" he said. But this, morally, is a devastating thing for us to have done. It's going to have devastating consequences across the world. ""I'm historically a critic of aid spending, but doing it this way is really so harmful... ""If you are going to kill people with this, which I think is going to be the outcome in many areas, we need to reverse those immediately."" At least 30 Conservative rebels, including ex-PM Theresa May, have backed the plan to force the Government to stick to its promise. They are privately confident they have the numbers to overturn Mr Johnson's 85-strong working majority and embarrass him into action. Rebel Tory MP Tom Tugendhat said he was ""cautiously optimistic"" there were enough backbenchers to force the Government's hand.",Real Mirror,554.0

The pandemic ban on evictions ends tomorrow and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation said 400,000 homes have either received notices to quit or are under threat of having to leave. Campaigners fear a wave of court orders for repossessions as bailiff-enforced evictions, halted in March 2020, resume.

The charity's Rachelle Earwaker said: ""High levels of arrears are restricting families' ability to pay bills and forcing many to rely on hidden borrowing.

The Prime Minister and new Mrs Johnson can't be blamed for hoping for a bit of luck. They have, according to friends, already had to delay their big day from last year. Some less-than-charitable observers suggested the timing of the wedding this weekend was… ""fortunate"". It came after an explosive week at Westminster in which the PM's former top aide delivered damning testimony on his handling of the pandemic, daily infection rates rose above 4,000 for the first time since early April and tricky questions emerged about why the Government delayed adding India to the red list. Some may wonder how he could focus on nuptials while the country still grapples with a pandemic. The big test will be whether his roadmap does indeed prove irreversible. If it doesn't, the PM's luck may not last. Catholic canon law does not permit the marriage of a divorcee whose former spouse is still alive, prompting questions on how Boris Johnson was able to marry his girlfriend Carrie Symonds at Westminster Cathedral this weekend. But while the faith does not allow divorcees to be married in its churches, as the PM's two previous other marriages were 'in non-Catholic settings', they were not recognised by the Church. Catholicism expert Catherine Pepinster said: ""As far as the Church is concerned, this is his first marriage. The others don't need to be annulled."" Mr Johnson's first marriage to Allegra Mostyn-Owen, who he met at Oxford, took place at St Michael's and All Angels in Shropshire and lasted six years. His second, to top barrister Marina Wheeler, happened at Horsham town hall in Sussex and lasted 27 years. But as neither were Catholic ceremonies they are not recognised in the eyes of the church. Other sources suggested that Mr Johnson may have had to seek special dispensation for the ceremony. Mr Johnson and his new bride were both baptised Catholics, though the PM renounced his mother's Catholicism when he was confirmed in the Anglican faith whilst at Eton. It is understood that the couple had been ""under instruction"" with Father Daniel Humphreys, who also baptised their son Wilfred, for ""many months"" before the ceremony.

469,Real,The Mirror,"Official documents revealing the horrors of the only Nazi concentration camps in the UK, on the island of Alderney, can be seen for the first time Official documents revealing the horrors of the only Nazi concentration camps to have existed on British soil can be seen in public for the first time. Thousands of French Jews, Russian prisoners of war and German political prisoners were interned on the tiny Channel island of Alderney between 1942 and 1945. The secret Pantcheff report, compiled 75 years ago, is supposed to be locked up in British archives until 2045 but a copy was given to Russia from where it has now emerged. It reveals that Britain investigated the atrocities after the war - but later refused to bring any prosecutions fearing an international embarrassment. The post-war Government also appears to have failed to help other countries seeking to do so. Lord Pickles, the UK's special envoy for post-Holocaust issues, said that people deserved to know why Britain failed to prosecute a single Nazi for war crimes committed there. The Tory former cabinet minister said: ""What happened does not reflect well on the British government at the time, and we are eager to ensure the full facts are understood by the nation. ""That is why I am saying we must release all documents related to the Holocaust that are currently classified by next January."" The grim details of the dossier detailing systematic violence and murder on the island were first revealed by ITV earlier this month, with more details released by the Sunday Times. The classified report written by British intelligence officer Major Theodore Pantcheff, then 24, shows what he found after a series of interviews on Alderney at the end of the war. The young officer, fluent in French and German, spoke with more than 3,000 witnesses, including former prisoners of war, German soldiers and civilians. They described Jews and Russians being beaten or murdered for pleasure, prisoners eating rotting food, rubbish and snails, and, in one case, the suggestion of cannibalism. Pantcheff also included an account of the torture of a Russian teenager who was made to sit on a hot stove for 30 minutes. He concluded: ""It has been established, I think, that crimes of a systematically brutal and callous nature were committed - on British soil - in the last three years."" The Channel Islands were occupied on June 15, 1940, after Winston Churchill decided they were of little strategic importance and could be left undefended. The Nazis had defeated the Allies in France just days before, forcing the French to surrender and the British off the continent. Churchill avoided mentioning the islands in his broadcasts, believing the thought of Nazis walking past red postboxes and English roadsigns could damage morale. Four months later, Hitler announced his plan to create an ""impregnable fortress"" on the islands at the heart of his Atlantic Wall to prevent an allied invasion of Europe. Alderney, whose residents had already been relocated, was to become one of the most heavily fortified sections and Nazi military engineers arrived shortly after. They oversaw the construction of four labour camps, starting in 1941, as well as other satellite prisons for slave labourers. In 1943, the SS arrived, turning two of them into concentration camps. It is thought that more than 6,000 people of 27 nationalities were taken to the island. Many arrived in cramped conditions on boats with less than one square metre deck space per man and no sanitary facilities on board. Some died during transit to or from the island, or while docked in the harbour for days waiting to get out. Josef Kaiser, a German naval officer, recalled 14 dead bodies being removed after a ship waited in harbour for five days with one body ""eaten by rats or Russians"". Prisoners lived in wooden barracks, many damp, flooded and structurally unsound, encircled by barbed wire fences. They spent most of their time outside doing at least 12 hours of heavy labour a day, with a short break at midday, for seven days a week. They had no special equipment and wore the same clothes year-round, with the exception of wooden clogs. The inmates lived on starvation diets, with ""half a litre of coffee, without milk or sugar"" for breakfast, ""half a litre of thin cabbage soup"" for lunch, and ""a similar portion of soup and a 1 kilo loaf among 5-6 men"" for dinner. Unsurprisingly, many of the men were soon broken, scavenging for food among scraps left by dogs and dead animals buried under manure. Ernest Vincent Clark, a British farmer who remained on the island, described a regular parade of sick prisoners brutally assaulted by camp guards, including being kicked in the kidneys. Senior Nazi officials were also responsible for horrific crimes with Karl Theiss, a commander, requiring his office walls to be repainted four times to remove bloodstains. Scharführer Hoeglow, the head of the SS troops, is listed as giving a 4 days' leave, extra food and drink to SS guards for every five dead prisoners. One Nazi medical orderly, Scharführer Krellmann, gave elderly and incapacitated prisoners lethal injections which killed them within five minutes.",Real Mirror,863.0

The Commons Leader told MPs the Government must take action to ensure others do not face the same struggle for justice as the families of the 96 who died. It comes after the trial of two former senior police officers and a solicitor accused of perverting the course of justice collapsed on Wednesday. Mr Rees-Mogg said: ""It is the greatest scandal of British policing of our lifetimes and the pain is still with those families.... ""And when nobody is held to account for that, it surely indicates that something has gone wrong in our criminal justice system."" Former Chief Supt Donald Denton, 83, retired Det Chief Insp Alan Foster, 74, and 71-year-old force solicitor Peter Metcalf, were acquitted after judge Mr Justice William Davis ruled there was no case to answer. The trio had been accused of amending officers' statements to minimise the blame on South Yorkshire Police following the disaster at the FA Cup semi-final on April 15, 1989, in which 96 Liverpool fans died. In his ruling, the judge said the altered statements were intended for a public inquiry into safety at sports grounds led by Lord Justice Taylor, but that was not considered ""a court of law"". Christine Burke, whose father Henry, 47, died in the crush, told the judge: ""The judiciary is broken."" Margaret Aspinall, whose 18-year-old son James also died that day, said: ""Until we can do something to change the system in this country to make it a level playing field then unfortunately ordinary people will never get anywhere with the system that we've got.""

471,Real,The Mirror,"Boris Johnson's shame as ex-aide Dominic Cummings skewers dithering Prime Minister with claim 'thousands died of Covid unnecessarily' as the PM 'wasn't taking advice from anyone' Tens of thousands of people have died unnecessarily because of Boris Johnson's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, it was claimed on Wednesday. In an astonishing admission, the Prime Minister's former closest aide Dominic Cummings told MPs his old boss was ""fundamentally unfit for office"". In bombshell testimony that will be deeply damaging to the man he helped propel into No 10, he claimed: ""Tens of thousands of people died, who didn't need to die."" More than 128,000 people have lost their lives to Covid since the start of the pandemic - more than half since the PM refused to bring in a quick lockdown last autumn. He insisted that Mr Johnson did say he would rather see ""bodies piled high"" than take the country into another lockdown - despite the PM dismissing the claims as ""total, total rubbish"". In marathon session of the Commons health and science committees that lasted more than seven hours, Mr Cummings painted a picture of a chaotic and dysfunctional Downing Street in denial over the scale of the disaster ahead. ""The truth is that senior ministers, senior officials, senior advisers like me fell disastrously short of the standards that the public has a right to expect of its Government in a crisis like this,"" he said. ""When the public needed us most, we failed. I'd like to say to all the families how sorry I am for the mistakes we made"". But he poured scorn on the PM for delaying bringing in lockdowns, ignoring the scientific advice and for putting the economy above the nation's health in the autumn. Mr Johnson refused to bring in another lockdown in September, finally agreeing to a month-long shutdown in November which scientists claimed was too little, too late. ""He wasn't taking any advice, he was just taking his own decision that he was going to ignore the advice. The Cabinet wasn't involved or asked."" Government scientists, ministers and No 10 aides had all urged the PM to introduce a short ""circuit breaker"" lockdown in September last year. But he declined despite modelling showing the NHS was going to get ""smashed again"" because of the economic impact of lockdown. ""I said to him the whole lesson of what happened before is that by delaying the lockdown to later it had to be more severe, it had to last longer, the economic disruption is even worse anyway. ""We will have killed God knows how many thousands of people in the meantime who have caught Covid who wouldn't have caught it if we act now - surely you have got to learn the lessons from the past. ""And the Prime Minister decided no and said basically we are just going to hit and hope."" Mr Cummings accused his old boss of failing to take the virus seriously even after it nearly killed him. In an extraordinary attack on Matt Hancock, he accused the Health Secretary of ""criminal, disgraceful behaviour"", alleging he had lied repeatedly throughout the pandemic and should have been sacked. Mr Cummings also turned his fire on Carrie Symonds, suggesting she had pursued ""completely unethical and clearly illegal"" attempts to pack No 10 with her own friends. In the Commons, Mr Johnson said: ""I take full responsibility for everything that has happened.  ""I am truly sorry for the suffering the people of this country experiences. ""But the Government acted throughout with the intention to save lives, protect the NHS and in accordance with the best scientific advice."" Yet much of Mr Cummings' extraordinary evidence threw those claims into doubt. The former top aide - who was forced out of No 10 at the end of last year after an internal power struggle - said those on the front line of the pandemic were like ""lions being led by donkeys"". He claimed the PM had told him he liked to be surrounded by ""chaos"" in Downing Street, because it meant everyone had to look to the PM ""to see who is in charge"". Asked if he thought Mr Johnson was a ""fit and proper person"" to get the UK through the pandemic, Mr Cummings replied: ""No."" Early last year as Covid-19 spread its grip across the country, Mr Johnson initially thought the virus was just a ""scare story"" and the ""new swine flu"", MPs heard. The PM had offered to ask Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty ""to inject me live on TV"" to show there was nothing to fear from the virus. Key people in Government ""literally went skiing"" and the PM disappeared for a ""holiday"" at official residence Chevening as it took its grip on the country last February. But the former adviser revealed that he texted the PM on March 12, 2020: ""We've got big problems coming. ""The Cabinet Office is terrifyingly sh*t - no plans, totally behind pace. ""We must announce today that if you feel ill stay home. We're looking at 100,000 to 500,000 deaths.""

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has promised that ""no child will be left behind"" as a result of the Covid disruption - but has yet to publish his own recovery plan for schools.

He added: ""The Government has promised that the recovery effort will see 'no child will be left behind'. That is the right approach. But it is also a big promise. ""The only way the Government keeps that promise is by fully backing the recovery effort with ambitious funding too. ""It is not an exaggeration to say that in today's unsettled world this country's long term future depends on the young people in school and college now.

It also wants ministers to provide targeted academic support for pupils who need it; extra-curricular provision and invest in extra-curricular providers; invest in school technology and remove unnecessary burdens and distractions. The Department for Education has made £1.7bn of catch-up funding available in England to help children who have faced disruption due to school and college closures during Covid.

They have insisted that the PM, who briefly met Woodward after the meeting, first learned of the plan when it was confirmed by the clubs. But a second source, close to the football clubs, also claimed the PM appeared to have given Mr Rosenfield the impression he was happy for the scheme to go ahead. They said: ""Ed came back to the clubs to say they had got the green light from No 10. Dan would not have [gone] all the way without checking Boris's view."" The plan for the so-called 'big six' English clubs to join a Super League with clubs like Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus first surfaced on April 18 - but dramatically unravelled just 48 hours later.

But questions over how much the PM knew – and when – have continued to trouble the footballing and political worlds. Sources have suggested that Mr Johnson may not have fully understood what he was supporting when the issue was allegedly first raised with him. It comes amid claims that the PM's chief of staff is planning to leave No 10 following the fiasco. Government sources suggested that the former banker had been in talks with US investment giant Blackrock. A No 10 spokesman said: ""This is completely untrue.

However, sources claimed that Mr Rosenfield had felt ""unhappy and undermined"" ever since he joined Downing Street in December. They allege that the PM told him he could appoint his deputy, then gave the job to Baroness Simone Finn, a friend of Carrie Symonds. They claimed that when he was tasked by the PM to shake up the No 10 policy unit, run by long-standing Johnson aide Munira Mirza, Mr Johnson then denied he had made the request. Asked when Mr Johnson first learned of the Super League plan, the spokesman said: ""On Sunday, as everybody else did.""

According to ITV, Mr Johnson added: ""I'm going to be the Mayor of Jaws, like I should have been in March."" He has previously said his political hero is the film's reckless Mayor who kept beaches open so families continued to swim in shark-infested waters.

It comes after Mr Johnson was last month forced to deny claims by multiple sources that he said he would rather ""see bodies pile high in their thousands"" than order a third coronavirus lockdown. The explosive comments allegedly came after he reluctantly accepted a second lockdown last autumn as Britain faced a further deadly wave of the disease. Downing Street did not deny Mr Johnson made the remarks - but insisted the Government had been focused throughout on saving lives.

""We are entirely focused on recovering from the pandemic, moving through the roadmap and distributing vaccines while delivering on the public's priorities.

Mr Johnson will face the toughest questions yet on his handling of the pandemic as a result of Mr Cummings' long-awaited showdown with the Commons science and health committees. For weeks he has been engaged in a bitter tit-for-tat with his former closest adviser over leaked text messages and key decisions he made as Britain was hit by the deadly virus. Mr Cummings will criticise the PM for repeatedly delaying lockdowns and accuse the Government of initially pursuing a policy of herd immunity. He is expected to single out Mr Johnson and Health Secretary Matt Hancock claiming that by failing to get a grip on the crisis they cost thousands of lives. While Mr Cummings' attacks so far have focused on the beginning of the pandemic, Government insiders are concerned that Mr Johnson is more vulnerable over his decision to delay the second lockdown in the autumn. He stands accused of ignoring the scientific advice and Opposition calls for another lockdown which could have helped prevent the deadly second wave of the virus. But Tory insiders have slammed Mr Cummings for pursuing a 'personal vendetta' against the PM as their relationship slowly broke down after the Mirror revealed Mr Cummings' lockdown breaking trip to County Durham last Spring. A Government source told The Times today he was trying to ""rewrite history"" and was a ""rank hypocrite"" because he played an integral role in planning for the pandemic.

He claimed that advisers ""screamed"" at the PM in March last year that his Covid strategy could ""kill at least 250,000 and destroy the NHS"" but there was no plan for a lockdown.

The plan will now go to ministers from member states to approve. The UK could also be included on an extended Brussels 'green list' allowing holiday travel from non-EU countries with infection rates below 100 cases per 100,000 people - but a decision is not expected until later this week. A spokesman for the EU presidency confirmed they had agreed ""certain waivers for vaccinated persons [and] easing the criteria to lift restrictions for third countries"". But that will not be enough on its own to open up breaks to the Continent - as destinations will need to be on the UK's own 'green list' too. And it will be up to individual member states to decide if they will accept proof of vaccination to waive travel restrictions. People from England should be able to use the NHS app to show they have had their jabs. Ministers have sowed confusion over UK rules for travelling to 'amber' list countries which includes France, Spain and Greece. And British tourists will still have to quarantine when they get home from those destinations. Portugal and Greece are among the countries that have already begun welcoming UK tourists, but an EU-wide move would boost the chances of a major summer getaway. British holidaymakers are currently banned from Spain, the most popular destination for UK holidaymakers. There was more confusion over the Government's position on overseas leisure travel after ministers appeared to contradict themselves. With a new traffic light system brought in on Monday to allow some foreign holidays to resume again after months of coronavirus lockdown, Boris Johnson stressed countries on the amber list are ""not somewhere where you should be going on holiday"". But Environment Secretary George Eustice telling broadcasters people could go to amber-listed countries as long as they observed quarantine rules on their return. And Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said the public should ask themselves whether a trip to a country on the amber list is ""essential"", before conceding that ""some people might think a holiday is essential"".",Real Mirror,414.0
477,Real,The Mirror,"People aged 36 will be offered the vaccine from tomorrow and this will be expanded down the age groups later in the week Brits have been told to urgently get the Covid jab as ministers warned the majority of those in hospital with the Indian variant had failed to get the vaccine. The number of cases of the highly contagious new strain has quadrupled in the last 10 days, up to 2,323, across all age groups and right across the country. Almost 500 of these are in Bolton and Blackburn-with-Darwen in Lancashire, where the Indian variant is now the dominant strain. Health Secretary Matt Hancock urged those hesitant to look at Bolton - where the majority of people in hospital with the India variant were eligible to get the jab but hadn't. Of the 18 hospitalised patients, some who are intensive care, five had had a single dose of the jab, one had had a second dose - and 12 had not been vaccinated at all. Another eight people are in hospital with the new strain in Blackburn. Mr Hancock told MPs: ""This shows the new variant is not tending to penetrate into older, vaccinated groups and it underlines again the importance of getting the jab especially - but not only - amongst the vulnerable age groups. ""He added: ""Vaccines save lives. They protect you, they protect your loved ones and they will help us all get out of this pandemic."" The vaccine roll-out has been sped up and mass-testing has been introduced in 'hotspots' across the country, also including Glasgow and London, to try to curb the spread. But more than 86 local authorities in England are now reporting five or more confirmed cases, with Bedford the next biggest area of concern. The Government has been accused of dragging its feet on putting India on the travel 'red list' because Boris Johnson wanted to travel there to strike a trade deal. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""Our borders have been as secure as a sieve. The delay in adding India to the red list surely now stands as a catastrophic misstep."" People aged 36 will be offered the vaccine from tomorrow and this will be expanded down the age groups later in the week. Top Government scientists have warned against socialising indoors and hugging friends which could put Britain's final steps out of lockdown in jeopardy. They have urged people to be cautious as the nation unlocks amid fears the highly contagious Indian strain could trigger ""another big wave"" of Covid this autumn. Millions of people across England are now able to mix inside pubs and restaurants, stay with friends and travel abroad on holidays for the first time since Christmas. In the clearest sign yet the final step out of England's roadmap on June 21 could be delayed, Boris Johnson dropped his deadline for major updates on social distancing, domestic vaccine passports and weddings. Just days after the Prime Minister promised them, No 10 confirmed it could no longer guarantee that the reviews would report back by the end of the month. Tory insiders admit that the final step out of lockdown - dubbed 'freedom day' - could be delayed if the Indian variant spreads out of control. This would mean advice to work from home, social distancing rules and limits on indoor gatherings to just six people or two households would all stay in place. It also makes the imminent expansion of holiday destinations look less likely - with just 12 countries already on the travel 'green list' and others unlikely to join them if infection rates soar. But Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng insisted it was still ""very likely"" all restrictions will be able to end as planned in the roadmap. He added: ""People should have common sense, they should use judgement. ""If we act in a reasonable way, there is no reason to suppose that we can't reopen the economy entirely on June 21."" New data yesterday showed the B.1.617.2 strain - originally found in India - had more than doubled in the UK in a week to over 2,300 cases. Prof Adam Finn, of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) said it was ""perfectly likely"" the PM will have to tear up plans for ending all restrictions from June 21. ""I really hope that the current concerns around this variant evaporate and that everything goes to plan,"" he said. ""But I think we just have to accept the possibility that we're in for another big wave and we will have to change what we're doing."" He added that it was ""actually quite risky"" to mix people together at this point in time - and he had told his own family to be ""very careful"" about making contact. SAGE member Sir Jeremy Farrar said it was not unreasonable to press ahead with yesterday's changes, but warned: ""This is the most difficult policy decision frankly in the last 15 months or so. It is very very finely balanced."" He added that he would not be meeting family and friends indoors ""for the moment"".",Real Mirror,849.0

The Opposition accused ministers of treating victims of violence as ""an afterthought"" because they are yet to publish a strategy to tackle the crisis. Last week, the Queen's speech, setting out the Government's legislative agenda, pledged that ""proposals will be brought forward"" but did not set out details. Labour has published a policy paper setting out proposals to toughen sentences for rape, stalking and domestic murder, and review sentencing for all domestic abuse. Whole-life tariffs for those who rape, abduct and murder a stranger would be introduced as the party seeks to define what it would be like in Government. Shadow justice secretary David Lammy said: ""The Conservatives are failing to protect women and girls from violent criminals, which should be one of the first duties of any government. ""With record low conviction rates for perpetrators of sexual violence and an epidemic of misogyny that makes women and girls feel unsafe, this Government is treating victims of violence as an afterthought."" Misogyny would also be made a hate crime under the proposals, while a specific offence of street sexual harassment would be created. Breaches of anonymity for an accuser of a sexual offence would carry custodial sentences and a survivor's support package would be introduced to improve court experiences. Boris Johnson has been under pressure to act in the wake of the killing of Sarah Everard after she was kidnaped while walking home from a friend's flat in March. But the Prime Minister is yet to publish a strategy to tackle violence against women and girls, which is expected by the end of the year. Shadow domestic violence and safeguarding minister Jess Phillips said: ""There have been too many warm words and far too little action from this Government.""",Real Mirror,340.0

Some foreign holidays are also back on the cards, along with hugging, trips to the cinema and theatre and staying overnight with family and friends. But experts urged caution as the highly-contagious Indian variant of Covid rampages across the country, sparking fears our regained freedoms may be short-lived. There are now at least 1,300 cases of the mutation in the UK with ""hotspots"" in Greater Manchester, London and Glasgow. And scientists are warning it is quickly becoming dominant.

One government adviser said the spread is putting Britain in a ""perilous moment"" that could put Boris Johnson 's hopes of relaxing all restrictions by June 21. The PM, who came under fire for not closing our borders to India earlier despite the country reporting 100,000 cases a day by April 5, said the latest lifting of curbs must be done ""with a heavy dose of caution"". He added: ""We are keeping the spread of the variant first identified in India under close observation and taking swift action where infection rates are rising. I urge everyone to be cautious and take responsibility when enjoying new freedoms today in order to keep the virus at bay."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock admitted the Indian variant – which may be 50% more infectious than the Kent one – could ""spread like wildfire"" among the unvaccinated population as the Government stepped up the pace of the jabs roll-out. But he insisted it was ""appropriate"" to push on with easing restrictions in England today. However, he would not rule out taking tougher measures if necessary – including local lockdowns in hotspot areas. As landlords and restaurant owners yesterday put the finishing touches to preparation to welcome customers back indoor, for Mr Hancock said: ""We will if it's necessary to protect people."" Government scientific adviser and SAGE expert Professor Sir Mark Walport warned it will be ""extremely important"" to keep an eye on the numbers of variant cases over the next few weeks. He said: ""The problem is the data takes a while to emerge, which is why there's every grounds to be very cautious about the ability to open up in June. ""It's fair to say it is a perilous moment. We have a variant that shows good evidence of being more transmissible and possibly significantly more transmissible."" Speaking of today's lifting of curbs, he added: ""My advice is because you can do something doesn't necessarily mean you should. Try to socialise outside, keep social distancing, if you're going to hug, hug cautiously."" Hoards of people were pictured queuing near Bolton's Essa Academy school vaccination centre yesterday as fears of regional lockdowns in the North West grew among locals. One said: ""I can't believe how many are here, it's crazy. They're queuing round the block for a jab."" Public Health England revealed the area has had a sharp spike in infections since mid-April. The Indian variant now makes up the majority of new cases. Demolition worker Darren Hall, 52, said: ""I thought it had all gone away, but it's not. I'm worried that we'd be the only town in the country still locked down."" During the pandemic lull last summer a spike of cases meant Bolton had to shut pubs and restaurants. Northern Monkey Brew Co manager Andreea Oros, 29, said: ""We've been pretty much shut for the whole thing."" Old Three Crowns landlady Lisa Day, 55, added: ""It is quite scary for everybody. ""We've been in it so long, everybody's saying, 'Not another lockdown. I'm not going to do it.' I just think enough is enough."" India was not added to the UK's red list of countries until April 23 – three weeks after Pakistan and Bangladesh were. Mr Johnson has been accused of dragging his heels because he wanted to go ahead with a visit to India to secure a trade deal. At least 20,000 passengers who could have been infected with the variant were allowed to enter Britain while he dithered.

Brexit minister Lord Frost issued a veiled threat that the UK was willing to walk away from its promises in the agreement unless Brussels gives ground on goods checks. Senior Government sources have suggested the Northern Ireland protocol is ""dead in the water"" unless the EU is prepared for the UK to row back on its commitments. One said: ""The marching season is a date whereby you would want to have a material improvement in what is happening. ""We need a bit of movement by then because that is when we risk seeing the kind of disruption and the protests that we had recently."" Lord Frost admitted that the Prime Minister's Brexit deal had disrupted deliveries of goods to the province from mainland Britain - which could put political stability at risk. In the Mail on Sunday, he conceded that extra paperwork and checks had resulted from the deal that he negotiated, and which Mr Johnson pushed through Parliament. But he accused the EU of taking a ""very purist view"" to the treatment of goods moving to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK - even though Brussels has warned throughout it would be necessary to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. Lord Frost suggested the PM could trigger Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol to suspend the checks as a result - meaning the EU could hit back with tariffs on UK goods. ""If the Protocol operates so as to damage the political, social, or economic fabric of life in Northern Ireland, then that situation cannot be sustained for long,"" he warned. ""We are responsible for protecting the peace and prosperity of everyone in Northern Ireland and we will continue to consider all our options for doing so."" But No 10 faces criticism for trying to shift the blame onto Brussels when it was fully aware of the commitments required by the deal. The EU is refusing to budge on the Protocol because it argues that it is a direct consequence of the Brexit. A No 10 spokesman said: ""We're committed to making the Northern Ireland protocol work and we're also at the same time asking for the EU to be more pragmatic.""",Real Mirror,429.0
481,Real,The Mirror,"Tory peer Eddie Lister admitted he did not disclose he was still being paid by a firm when it received a taxpayer-backed loan One of Boris Johnson's top former aides has apologised for approving a £187million taxpayer-backed loan to a big property developer he was being paid to advise. Eddie Lister supported the payment by affordable housing quango Homes England to Delancey, a firm which has built luxury flats in the Olympic Park in East London. The Tory peer, who suddenly quit No 10 last month, admitted to colleagues at a key meeting in May 2019 that he had ""previously"" carried out advisory work for the developer. But he did not tell them that while chairing Homes England he was still being paid by the company - which then received the biggest loan paid out by the government agency. Lord Udny-Lister apologised for not recusing himself from the decision-making meeting but claimed he had never lobbied for Delancey. The ex-aide, who worked for Boris Johnson at City Hall and No 10, told the Sunday Times that ""there was never any intent to gain any unfair advantage for the company"". Delancey said it had never asked Lister to lobby on its behalf. A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesman said: ""We introduced the £3.5 billion Private Rented Sector Guarantee Scheme and made changes to the National Planning Policy Framework to support additional new build private rented homes. ""The loan for the programme was raised in the bond market, supported by the Government's guarantee rather than with taxpayer's money, ensuring good value for money. ""Proper process was followed at all times."" It is not the first time that the top Tory, who stayed on the payroll of two property firms throughout his time in No 10, has been caught up in allegations of a potential conflict of interest. The Mirror revealed earlier this month that he was involved in discussions on a massive shake-up of planning laws despite his other jobs with the developers. He admitted he had attended several meetings where the planning changes had been discussed - but denied he was a key architect of the plans.

The former Labour leader, who is currently suspended from the party, told ITV it was ""a bit rich"" for the current Labour leadership ""to dump"" on him responsibility for the party's poor electoral performance. It came as Tony Blair launched a stinging attack on the ""woke left"" warning that Labour needs ""nothing less"" than a total reconstruction to survive. The three-election winning ex-Labour PM admitted that Keir Starmer was ""struggling to break through with the public"" and needed a more compelling economic message to win back support. Following bruising defeats in English elections last week, Mr Blair said Labour had to present itself as a ""centre-ground, moderate, forward-thinking party"" or be condemned to certain defeat. In a devastating verdict on the state of his party, he claimed Labour needs a ""total deconstruction and reconstruction. Nothing less will do"". Writing in the New Statesman, he added: ""Keir seems sensible but not radical. He lacks a compelling economic message. ""And the cultural message, because he is not clarifying it, is being defined by the 'woke' left, whose every statement gets cut-through courtesy of the right."" But he warned those threatening to oust Mr Starmer that the party ""won't revive simply by a change of leader"". Mr Corbyn, who led the party to the worst general election defeat since 1935, said he took ""no responsibility "" for the local or by-election result.

Her sister, Kim Leadbeater, a campaigner who has lived locally all her life, confirmed she hoped to be the Labour candidate for her home town. The party is defending a slim majority of 3,525 votes in the seat after local MP Tracy Brabin was elected at the weekend as the first mayor of West Yorkshire.

The British Government has urged leaders in both Israel and Palestine to ""step back from the brink"" as violence intensified in the region. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab spoke to his Israeli counterpart yesterday, and was speaking to the Israeli Palestinian PM today, to ask him them to help de-escalate the situation amid warnings it was escalating hurtling towards full-scale war. But Lord Goldsmith, a close friend of Boris Johnson's fiancee Carrie Symonds, retweeted a message from the Israeli Defence Force which featured Hamas rockets being fired over Israel. He wrote: ""No country on earth would be expected to tolerate these incessant attacks on innocent civilians - by an organisation committed to their total eradication. Why should Israel?"" The tweet was later deleted after the Mirror approached the Foreign Office. Layla Moran MP said: ""Zac Goldsmith was right to take his tweet down. To present that view without any of the preceding context is deeply unhelpful to de-escalation efforts. ""The focus now must be on peace and getting everyone round the negotiating table."" Whitehall sources suggested that the Tory peer was able to ""get away with anything"" because of his relationship with Ms Symonds. Rockets were fired from Gaza while Israeli forces bombarded the territory with air strikes in the most serious fighting since the 50-day war in 2014. The Prime Minister called for restraint and said the UK is alarmed at the mounting toll of civilian casualties. Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza have fired hundreds of rockets at Tel Aviv and other cities. Israel has responded with air strikes targeting police and security installations, although the Palestinian authorities said there have been civilian casualties. The death toll in Gaza rose to 35 Palestinians, including 12 children and three women, according to the health ministry, with some 233 people injured. Five Israelis, including three women and a child, were killed by rocket fire on Tuesday and early on Wednesday, and dozens of other people were injured. Mr Johnson said: ""I am urging Israel and the Palestinians to step back from the brink and for both sides to show restraint. The UK is deeply concerned by the growing violence and civilian casualties and we want to see an urgent de-escalation of tensions."" Minister for the Middle East, James Cleverly, urged all sides to ""refrain from any kind of provocation so that calm is restored as quickly as possible"". ""Our priority must now be a de-escalate on all sides and an end to civilian deaths,"" he said. He told MPs that the UK ""unequivocally condemns"" Hamas and other terrorist groups firing rockets into Israel. ""There is no justification for any targeting of civilians."" Mr Cleverly said that while Israel had a legitimate right of self-defence it was ""vital"" that all actions were proportionate.

Labour's deputy leader will appear alongside Keir Starmer at a series of joint public visits across the country as they put on a united front after a botched reshuffle. After a bruising few days, she admitted the party - and its leader - had failed to articulate what it stood for. Instead of ""fluffy language"", Labour needed to promise decent, secure jobs that paid enough to get a home and look after family. In her first interview since the chaos of the weekend, Ms Rayner admitted she had found it ""difficult"" after being initially sacked from her party role, then given a broader brief to set out Labour's plans and take on the Tories. She said internal briefings around her position had been ""frustrating"" and revealed how she was ""disappointed"" that the situation had overshadowed some of the party's better results. Ms Rayner admitted that she and Mr Starmer had had ""robust and frank"" conversations around her role but that their teams were now working together. But she insisted she remained loyal to her boss - with whom she has a ""huge amount of mutual respect"" - despite claims from allies she could mount a leadership challenge amid the chaos. ""I'm getting on with the job of supporting Labour being a party of a Government in waiting. That's what we need to focus on,"" she said. ""Not just attack the Tories where they're doing things wrong, but also talking about what we'd do. ""Talking about the differences between the Conservatives and us, and talking about what type of Britain we want."" Ms Rayner batted away claims she still had one eye on the leadership herself. ""I want to be deputy PM. I want to get into Government as quickly as we possibly can. I'm absolutely focused on that. People don't care about my job, they care about their jobs."" But the fall-out from the elections rumbled on after Labour MP Carolyn Harris, a close aide to Mr Starmer, stepped down when she was accused of negative briefings about Ms Rayner. ""I don't think anybody should be discussing people's private lives,"" she responded, although she had not seen the reports. ""We're professionals. It's about what we do for the country and how we perform in our roles."" She added: ""I've always found Keir to be incredibly professional. ""When we took over our joint leadership we were very clear about how we wanted to set that culture and standard in our organisation."" As she reflected on Labour's losses - which saw it suffer a devastating loss in the Hartlepool by-election as well as a swathe of council seats across the so-called 'red wall' - Ms Rayner admitted the party had failed to articulate what it stood for.

486,Real,The Mirror,"The Prime Minister has been warned that more delays will lead to a ""rocketing"" number of elderly people desperately in need of support and struggling to pay the bills. Boris Johnson faces angry calls to finally deliver on his promise to fix the social care funding crisis after ministers dashed hopes it would feature in today's Queen's Speech. The Prime Minister has been warned that more delays will lead to a ""rocketing"" number of elderly people desperately in need of support and struggling to pay the bills. Ministers have downplayed suggestions that a full funding package will be published today - instead suggesting millions of elderly people will be left in limbo until later this year. Social care funding is expected to be touched on in the programme of bills but there is unlikely to be any detail - even though Mr Johnson said he had a plan ready almost two years ago. Tory insiders have admitted that a ""fudge"" is on the cards after the PM and Rishi Sunak failed in recent weeks to reach agreement on a long-term funding mechanism. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: "" Boris Johnson made a solemn promise to the British people on the steps of Downing Street that he would quickly bring forward a solution to social care. ""The test of the Queen's Speech today is whether he delivers on his word. ""The pandemic has shown the tragic folly of failing to invest and reform social care. ""After years of cuts and inaction we need change today."" The Mirror's 'Fair Care for All' campaign demands that the elderly are afforded proper care, dignity and security in old age and not abandoned. The pandemic has significantly increased the need for social care, with one in four elderly people finding it harder to carry out everyday activities. Analysis showed that 23% of people aged 60 and over found activities like using the stairs, walking short distances, washing and preparing food had worsened. Caroline Abrahams of Age UK said: ""It's really sad that the pandemic has taken such a toll on the mobility, confidence and capacity of millions of older people to live independently without support."" She added: ""Before the pandemic we already knew that 1.6 million older people had some unmet need for care, but our new research means this awful statistic could rocket even higher this year unless the Government acts fast. ""We must never forget too that behind the cold statistics are real older people who with the right care and support could be living much happier, safer and healthier lives."" Mr Johnson is understood to be interested in a plan from Sir Andrew Dilnot to cap costs for individuals at £45,000 with the state covering the rest. But the Treasury and No 10 are understood to be stuck in talks over the cost with suggestions a funding package could require either dramatic cuts or tax rises up to £5bn a year. Council leaders from across the political divide in England yesterday urged ministers to make good on their promise to fix social care. The Local Government Association warned that a failure to act on long-promised social care reform would be a ""bitter blow"" for care staff and the millions they help. Care groups, charities and politicians have long been calling for the PM to deliver on the promise in his first speech after entering No 10 in July 2019. When asked last week the PM was unable to guarantee that proposals would be detailed today, instead saying these would be brought forward in the ""next few months"". In a letter to the Chancellor, the LGA warned that one-off Government grants and the social care council tax precept were ""sticking plaster solutions"" when long-term funding was needed. The social care system has been crumbling for more than a decade with the Covid pandemic laying bare how close it is to collapse.  Around 1.5m elderly people do not get the help they need. Many are forced to depend on under-paid and over-stretched carers working for cash-strapped firms as councils make cuts.  Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said at the weekend that a social care reform plan would be ""heading for the statute books"" by the end of the year. He said: ""We're working to make sure that we have an effective social care plan at the moment.

The Labour leader told his top team there was no escaping the scale of the defeats which demonstrated ""the size of the journey we have to go"" in England. Tensions were still bubbling internally after he stripped his deputy Angela Rayner of her party and campaign roles after the Hartlepool by-election. She was given new roles at the 11th hour which he said would ""take the fight to the Tories"" amid furious accusations that he was trying to make her a scapegoat. But Mr Starmer told the meeting: ""To be clear, I take responsibility. ""Nobody else. I lead the Labour Party and it is entirely on me."" The party will now embark on a policy review to produce ideas to chime with voters after they lost a swathe of council seats across their traditional heartlands. Labour officials are also studying electoral successes in Wales, Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire to see how they can better connect with the public. The party's new campaigns chief Shabana Mahmood admitted it must balance attracting former voters across the Midlands and the North without putting off supporters in cities.

A lot of people are voting based on cultural disposition and cultural outlook, rather than just the economics of the programme."" Many Labour MPs are downbeat about the prospect of Labour regaining ground amongst its former base, as a dramatic post-Brexit political realignment continues. But Mr Starmer will attempt to get onto the front-foot on Tuesday by urging the Government to transform Britain's economy with a central focus on good jobs. Attacking the Government's ""piecemeal approach"" to tackling inequalities between different parts of the country, he will claim that ""making people and places scrap over funding pots won't deliver the fundamental change our country needs."" A Labour source said: ""A failure to turn rhetoric into reality today will be one in the eye to the people and the places Boris Johnson has made such big promises to. ""It's one thing talking a good game – but the time has now come to deliver."" And Ms Rayner said she would ""work tirelessly to reform our party"" in order to ""show that the Labour Party speaks for the working class"". Former prime minister Gordon Brown said Labour had to change as society is facing ""seismic changes"", such as widening social inequalities and nationalism. ""So, the Labour Party has got to change, we can never have the same policies at 1997 - they can't be the same policies at 2019,"" he said. But Lord Peter Mandelson, former right-hand man to Tony Blair, is understood to be advising key members of Mr Starmer's staff, prompting the anger of the Left.

The Labour leader on Wednesday toured the country campaigning for ""every last vote"" in the swathe of ""Super Thursday"" council, mayoral and national contests. As voters go to the polls today, he sets out his five-point plan to put Labour firmly on the path back to power, promising ""a brighter, better future for you, your family and your community"". Writing in the Mirror, he says: ""I'm driven by a burning desire to make this country the best place to grow up in and the best place to grow old in, whoever you are and wherever you live."" But he insisted that rebuilding the party after its worst general election defeat in more than 80 years under Jeremy Corbyn would take time. Out on the campaign trail, he said: ""We've got to rebuild into the next general election – that is the task at hand."" Polls suggest Labour could be hammered in the Hartlepool by-election as the post-Brexit shift continues and the Tories benefit from a ""vaccine bounce"". A defeat there would be a blow to Mr Starmer in what is being seen as a test of Labour's appeal to its heartlands just over a year after he pledged to rebuild the ""red wall"". But one senior Labour source said: ""This was always going to be tough. There is a realignment going on that can't be stopped in a year – especially during the pandemic."" Voters will have their say on English councils, the Scottish and Welsh parliaments as well as picking who holds power in city halls and regional mayoralties across England. It is the largest set of contests outside of a general election after last year's polls were delayed by Covid. Boris Johnson, who campaigned on a bike on the Stourbridge canal in the West Midlands, claimed the elections would be ""very tough"", despite the party being expected to make gains. Labour is expected to perform strongly in mayoral votes, including a victory for Sadiq Khan in London. ""King of the North"" Andy Burnham is likely to hold Greater Manchester while the party should keep Liverpool, Bristol and a swathe of town councils. It is also hoping to take the West of England mayoralty. Other targets are seats in councils across the South. But it will be tested in the West Midlands, where Labour ex-minister Liam Byrne is snapping at the heels of Tory mayor Andy Street.

But former deputy leader Harriet Harman said he should not resign no matter how badly the party fares. She said: ""He's has been trying to get the party sorted out and back on track so that we can win the confidence of British people."" The party has been closing the gap in national polls with Tory ""sleaze"" rows beginning to bite. In Wales, Labour is expected to remain the biggest party but fall short of an outright majority. And in Scotland, polls suggest it is too close to call whether the SNP will get an outright majority. If they do, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said it would give a mandate for another independence referendum. Mr Johnson dismissed another vote as ""irresponsible"" given the pandemic. Labour could overtake the Tories in Scotland to become the second biggest party under Anas Sarwar. On Thursday, ex-PM Gordon Brown lent his support in Glasgow. Mr Starmer – seen campaigning in Pontefract with Yvette Cooper and West Yorkshire mayoral candidate Tracy Brabin – said he will be a leader who ""carries the can"". He said: ""This is but a step on the road to the next general election. ""My job is to ensure that we get from where we were in December 2019 to a position to win the next general election. I'm utterly determined to do that."" He added: ""I take full responsibility for everything the Labour Party does, including in these elections.

The Labour leader said the party would be ""fighting for every vote"" and that he hoped it would not lose another seat in the Red Wall.

Ahead of Thursday's vote, a Survation poll for ITV's Good Morning Britain put the Conservatives on 50% – 17 points ahead of Labour in a seat it has held since it was created in 1974. The scale of the challenge in the seat is not a surprise to many in Labour as the Brexit Party received a chunk of the vote in 2019 and popular local Tory mayor Ben Houchen has brought investment to the region. Mr Starmer's bigger test will be how Labour does in council and mayoral elections across England, as well as national polls in Scotland and Wales. ""I hope we won't lose Hartlepool. We are fighting for every vote there. I know that every vote has to be earned,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

Ministers have been accused of channeling funds to Conservative seats rather than into areas which are in most need of economic and infrastructure support. On a campaign visit to Wales, Mr Starmer insisted that Tory sleaze allegations should matter to voters - and showed there was one rule for Boris Johnson, and one for everybody else. ""I don't actually go along with this argument that says, 'well it's priced-in, it may be that the Prime Minister is not being straight but it doesn't really matter',"" he said.

Mr Cummings is said to be preparing a bombshell dossier to present to the joint committee of MPs investigating the Government's handling of the coronavirus crisis on May 26. Mr Johnson allegedly told advisers he was ruling out more ""f***ing lockdowns"" after the second bout of restrictions in November, vowing to avoid them regardless of the number of ""bodies"". No10 has denied the claims. The Prime Minister has been mired in escalating scandals on several fronts that threaten to overwhelm his administration over the weekend. They include civil servants ""double-hatting"" by working in the public and private sectors simultaneously, creating possible conflicts of interest. Former Whitehall procurement chief Bill Crothers became an adviser to Greensill Capital – the bank ex-PM David Cameron lobbied the Treasury for – while still working in the Civil Service. And there were security concerns after Mr Johnson was discovered to have rejected a secure government-issue iPhone when he took office, keeping his personal device. Leak scandals threatened to overwhelm Downing Street too, as it accused Dominic Cummings of releasing texts between the PM and Sir James Dyson, and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. According to reports, the intelligence services had identified Mr Cummings as a culprit but ""could not publish their evidence because it would reveal the secrets of their tradecraft"", including their accessing of WhatsApp messages. Cummings denied the claim in a furious blog post, also denying being the ""chatty rat"" leaker who revealed the second lockdown in November. He instead accused a friend of the PM's fiancee Carrie Symonds. Mr Cummings has also accused Mr Johnson of plotting an ""unethical, foolish, possibly illegal"" plan to get Tory donors to secretly fund a lavish refurbishment of his Downing Street flat. Cabinet minister Liz Truss claimed yesterday that Mr Johnson paid for the refurbishment out of his own pocket – but was unable to say where he had got the money. The PM also faces questions over whether he and Miss Symonds initially accepted a gift from Tory donors to carry out the refurb but failed to declare it, thereby avoiding tax payments.

Unite will ramp up pressure on the Government to protect workers' rights as thousands of employees have been forced to accept worse pay and conditions to keep their jobs. They want ministers to make the controversial practice illegal, just as it is in Ireland and Spain, and is backing industrial action by members in a number of disputes. Boris Johnson has condemned fire and rehire as ""unacceptable"" while business minister Paul Scully pledged last month to tackle the practice, which he condemned as ""bully boy tactics"". But ministers have also suggested that firms facing financial difficulty, some as a result of the pandemic, must have the flexibility to offer new terms and conditions. The TUC has found that one in ten workers had been threatened with fire and rehire during the pandemic - with the number expected to grow as furlough ends, unless the law is changed. A recent investigation of firms engaging in fire and rehire found that 70% are turning a profit while over half received Government support during the pandemic. The campaign follows hundreds of British Gas engineers losing their jobs last week after they refused to sign up to longer hours under the firm's controversial dismiss and re-engage scheme. British Airways struck a deal with Unite earlier this year which ended the long-running dispute over the airline's plans to 'fire and rehire' employees in its cargo division. Unite, which has a £40m strike fund, is representing its members in a number of disputes with employers including Go North West buses and Goodlord lettings. Bus drivers employed by Go North West, part of the Go Ahead group, claim they were given days' notice to sign up to new contracts. At least 400 drivers in Manchester have been striking against the changes, which the union claims will increase working hours without additional pay. Staff at the London-based Goodlord, which provides reference checks for estate agents, claim they were subject to a similar practice last year. Both companies deny they are using fire and rehire tactics.

Holidaymakers with vaccine passports are likely to be exempt from a blanket entry ban to Europe thanks to the UK's successful jabs rollout. Ministers are working on plans for Covid status certificates, which will allow people to prove if they've had the jab, a negative test or they have antibodies due to a recent Covid infection. The certificates, which the Government plans to announce next month, were originally designed to allow Brits to prove they have been vaccinated when they go abroad. EU officials are planning to update entry recommendations to the bloc meaning travellers from countries with Covid 'passport' systems and higher vaccination rates could be allowed in, possibly from June. Foreign travel is currently illegal in most circumstances - but the Government is examining whether to relax the rules for the next stage of the roadmap after May 17. Probably, but your choices could be limited. Under the Government's roadmap, May 17 is the earliest people in England and Wales can leave the country for foreign holidays. The PM has said there is nothing in the data to suggest the date will need to change. It's not clear yet but the Government will announce a 'traffic light' green list - probably only of 7 or 8 countries initially - before May 17. These are likely to include ""safe"" ones where case rates are low and vaccination rates are high, like Iceland, Israel, Gibraltar, the UAE and possibly the United States. They could also reach a deal with the EU based on vaccine certification. The Government is planning to issue Covid passports - either in paper or digital form - so Brits can prove at foreign borders that they have been vaccinated. This could happen next month. While this wouldn't change the rules when you get home, it could mean that more countries - and the EU - are prepared to let Brits in because of our high jab and low case rates. There are currently no plans to vaccinate children under the age of 16 in the UK, and a trial of the AstraZeneca vaccine was halted amid fears of a rare blood clot. The EU's own Covid passports - known as digital green certificates - will show recent Covid test results thus allowing children who tested negative to travel. It's hoped the UK travel scheme will follow suit. Hopefully. The European Commission is planning to update entry recommendations to the bloc in June meaning travellers from countries with Covid 'passport' schemes and higher vaccination rates could be allowed in. But several countries, expected to include Spain, Portugal, Greece and Cyprus, might allow in Brits anyway. Countries will be graded green, amber and a possibly updated red list, with each colour meaning different rules around testing and quarantining on your return. If you travel to a 'green' country you'll need one pre-departure test up to 72 hours before returning to the UK and a gold-standard PCR test two days after arriving. You'll only have to quarantine if the test is positive. If your holiday destination is on the 'amber' list - which could include Spain, Greece and Turkey, you'll need a pre-departure test and have to quarantine at home for 10 days when you get back. You'll also need tests on days two and eight, though could pay for an extra test on day five and if it's negative you will be able to leave. Full vaccinated people might avoid self-isolation. For now, but countries could be added or removed to the list of 40, which currently includes South Africa, Pakistan, Brazil and - from Friday - India from which all arrivals are banned unless you're a UK or Irish citizen or resident.

They will be subject to a range of restrictions, including testing and quarantine, when they return to the UK depending on the 'traffic-light status' of their holiday destination. Separately, the European Commission is planning to roll out a Europe-wide vaccine passport scheme for EU citizens by the end of June. One Brussels source told the Mirror: ""There is provision to strike deals with countries outside the EU which have their own scheme for vaccination certification. ""We need to get Europe up and running as a first priority before opening up to the outside. ""There's definitely lots of pressure to do this before the summer so I think it's a question of weeks"". They added: ""The discussion is going to shift to people who have had the vaccination, wherever they come from."" But some EU officials remain cautious about the risk of new strains entering the bloc, after the so-called 'Kent variant' drove up cases on the Continent. Talks on a deal on Covid travel passports have yet to take place with the EU as whole - with British officials discussing the issue with individual European capitals instead. Countries that rely on tourists like Spain and Portugal could go it alone - Greece and Cyprus are already operating different rules from the rest of the block. Quarantine rules and testing regimes for holidaymakers will be decided by each member state. Spain's tourism minister Fernando Valdes today said the country is ""desperate"" to welcome British tourists back this summer. He said officials are encouraged by the speed of the UK's vaccination programme and vaccine passports are ""going to help us"". Mr Valdes told Sky News: ""I think we will be ready here in Spain. We also think that the vaccination scheme in the UK is going pretty well, so hopefully we'll be seeing this summer the restart of holidays."" Under the UK Government's roadmap, May 17 is the earliest people can leave the country for foreign holidays. When foreign breaks are allowed, other countries are likely to ask for proof that UK travellers have been vaccinated. Much-hyped 'Covid certificates' for UK domestic use - allowing Brits to show they've had either a vaccine, negative test or a previous Covid case to get into gigs and sports matches - are likely to only come later. A Department for Transport spokeswoman said: ""We are working on a solution to enable residents to prove their Covid-19 status, including vaccination status, to other countries on the outbound leg. We are working on this as a priority and intend to have the solution ready as soon as possible."" Hopes are rising that the vaccinated will be able to go on holiday more freely, after a European medical agency recommended fully vaccinated travellers should be able to sidestep tests and quarantine. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said: ""Requirements for testing and quarantine of travellers and regular testing at workplaces can be waived or modified for fully vaccinated individuals."" The condition, it added, was that there was not widespread circulation of ""immune escape variants"" of Covid in the person's home country. The breakthrough potentially smooths the path for holidays to more than 20 countries that have indicated they could ask travellers for proof of vaccination - such as Spain, Portugal, Cyprus, Croatia, Turkey and Greece. But the Transport Select Committee warned the restart of international travel is in jeopardy, with ""vague and costly"" proposals not enough to reboot the aviation and tourism sectors. It said a report produced by the Government's Global Travel Taskforce gave ""insufficient"" detail to allow businesses and travellers to prepare for the safe resumption of holidays from May 17 at the earliest. It added testing requirements could be ""disproportionate to the risk"", and may add £500 to the cost of a family of four visiting the ""safest"" parts of the globe where vaccine rollout is comparable to the UK.",Real Mirror,870.0

Labour has accused the Tories of operating ""government by Whatsapp"" with only those with links to senior ministers able to get access. Whitehall's top civil servant is said to be concerned about how easily the PM can be contacted by text by lobbyists, MPs and business people. But Mr Johnson is reported to have rejected Cabinet Secretary Simon Case's advice to change his mobile phone number, which he has had for more than a decade. The PM has a reputation for listening to the last person he has spoken to, leading to fears that he could be vulnerable to changing or adopting policy. Mr Kwarteng told Sky News: ""I think that in the real world, in reality, people are contacting ministers, contacting MPs, all the time. ""Business people are contacting MPs all the time, constituents also contact me on my phone. ""I think that in a modern democracy it's very good that people actually can have direct access to ministers and people who are taking responsibility."" It came as Mr Johnson's ex-comms chief Lee Cain warned that without more working-class figures at the top of Government, ministers would be ""ever more baffled and out of touch"" with the electorate. Mr Kwarteng acknowledged there were ""issues"" around the Greensill Capital controversy, adding that while there is ""high standards"" in public life ""we can always try and make an improvement"".

The Opposition also urged No 10 to release all information from the Prime Minister's mobile phone relating to Government business. They also want Downing Street to release details of any other communications between ministers, officials and external commercial lobbyists. The Tories have become embroiled in a row after it emerged Mr Johnson exchanged text messages with billionaire Sir James Dyson over the tax status of his employees. The PM personally promised the entrepreneur he would ""fix"" the problem after Sir James asked for assurances over tax status for his staff if they came to build ventilators early in the coronavirus crisis."" Shadow cabinet office minister Rachel Reeves called for Sir Bernard Jenkin, chair of the Liaison Committee comprised of select committee chairs, to launch an investigation. In a statement, Ms Reeves added: ""Revelations today seem to confirm a growing feeling that if one has access to a telephone number of someone like the Prime Minister or the Chancellor of the Exchequer, then they are able to gain special treatment, potentially even significant financial ones. ""We need the Prime Minister to appear before the Liaison Committee immediately and for a thorough investigation into his conduct on this matter."" Earlier in the day, the BBC reported a series of text messages between Mr Johnson and Sir James exchanged in March last year after the businessman was unable to get the assurances he was seeking from the Treasury. Sir James, whose firm is now based in Singapore, wrote to the Treasury requesting that his staff would not have to pay additional tax if they came to the UK to work on the ventilator project. But when he failed to receive a reply, he took up the matter directly with the PM. He said in a text that the firm was ready but that ""sadly"" it seemed no-one wanted them to proceed. Mr Johnson replied: ""I will fix it tomo! We need you. It looks fantastic."" Labour leader Keir Starmer suggested it was ""one rule for those that have got the Prime Minister's phone number, another for everybody else"". But Mr Johnson told the Commons during Prime Minister's Questions that he was ""happy to share all the details"" of the exchanges as there was ""nothing to conceal"". Sir James said he was ""hugely proud"" of his firm's response in ""the midst of a national emergency"", and that he would ""do the same again if asked"". He told the BBC: ""When the Prime Minister rang me to ask Dyson to urgently build ventilators, of course, I said yes. ""Our ventilator cost Dyson £20 million, freely given to the national cause, and it is absurd to suggest that the urgent correspondence was anything other than seeking compliance with rules, as 450 Dyson people - in UK and Singapore - worked around the clock, seven days a week to build potentially life-saving equipment at a time of dire need. ""Mercifully, they were not required as medical understanding of the virus evolved.

Ministers face calls to change the rules so that senior civil servants are banned from working for private firms while they are being paid by the taxpayer, to avoid a conflict of interests. The revelations come just days after Simon Case, the Cabinet Secretary, ordered all civil servants to reveal their second jobs in the wake of the Greensill lobbying scandal. Boris Johnson has tried to play down the extent of links between Whitehall and the private sector, insisting there are ""not loads of people"" working for both at the same time. But he has asked lawyer Nigel Boardman to investigate the issue after it emerged that former Government procurement chief Bill Crothers advised Greensill while in his Whitehall job. Mr Crothers role was approved by Cabinet Office at the time, which said there was no conflict of interest. An analysis by the Daily Telegraph found at least a dozen more Whitehall mandarins and bureaucrats paid £150,000 or more a year have held second jobs. They include Jonson Cox, the head of the Water Services Regulation Authority (Ofwat) who holds non-executive roles at two energy companies. A spokesman for Ofwat said that all appointments had been subject ""to rigorous conflict of interest checks and were approved by the permanent secretary for DEFRA"". Another is Sir Stephen Lovegrove, the UK's National Security Adviser, who is also a non-executive director at a property company. Sources told the newspaper that all the money he receives from the private sector work he gives to charity. While none of the officials broke any rules, the extent of the ""double-hatting"" has intensified calls for a crackdown. Sir Alistair Graham, former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said the findings were ""shocking"" as he called for senior civil servants to be banned from the practice. William Wragg MP, chair of the Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, which takes evidence from Mr Case next week, said: ""These revelations highlight the urgent need to have full disclosure of remunerated positions of senior civil servants and officials.

But the move has prompted concern among Cabinet Office officials about conflicts of interest in the race to roll out satellite internet networks. The department's ethics team is believed to be investigating the appointment amid growing concern over the role of unpaid advisers that came to light after the Greensill scandal. There is anxiety over the Government's £400m OneWeb low-orbit satellite project, which could provide remote broadband, and a similar scheme, Project Kuiper, developed by Amazon. Mr Marquez, a former White House Director of Space Policy under Presidents Bush and Obama, was appointed Amazon's first head of space policy last year. The American would be expected to provide advice to the ministers on policy, strategy and legislation as the UK expands its space capability.

In an emotional speech, Bell Ribeiro-Addy, described how her pre-eclampsia was spotted too late and she was told by doctors that she and her child could both lose their lives. ""My last conversation with the consultants was harrowing. They said my pregnancy had become very dangerous, either my child would die or myself and my child would die,"" she said. ""My diagnosis was too late for any intervention... Their advice was for a late termination and a delivery to save myself."" A hospital scan the following day showed her baby's heart had stopped beating - Ms Ribeiro-Addy's daughter was induced and was stillborn 18 hours later. Fighting back tears, the MP for Streatham in South London, said: ""As a person of faith even then I had faith that maybe the doctors were wrong and everything would be okay. ""But she did not move, she did not cry and there was no miracle."" A major report earlier this year found that black women are four times more likely to die during childbirth or in the weeks after. ""We know this and yet we have no target to end this,"" the Labour MP said. ""During my own pregnancy it was not hard to find instances where as a black woman, how I was perceived or believed, drastically impacted the care I received. ""From complaints to how I was feeling to being denied scans"". Ms Ribeiro-Addy said that black babies had a 50% increased risk of neonatal death and a 121% increased risk of stillbirth, compared with white babies. ""With figures like that I wonder how much of a chance she really had? We know this and we have no target to end this."" She cited figures that show that 80% of women of black Caribbean heritage, and 83% of those with black African heritage, suffered a ""near miss"" during pregnancy. ""I would like for people to stop blaming black women...,"" she added. ""So often black women are viewed as the problem but we could be the solution if you would just listen to us, if you would just respect us and if you would just care for us."" Turning her fire on the Government, she said: ""We are black woman who decide to bring life into this world and that choice has become a matter of life and death and health.

503,Real,The Mirror,"After kids suffer a year of isolation, broken learning and lost chances, our Education Secretary says THEIR behaviour is the problem but, as we look back at all of Gavin Williamson's blunders, we find it is he who must try harder... Gavin Williamson is facing an angry backlash for failing to prioritise the well-being of pupils in a ""Dickensian"" crackdown on back-to-school behaviour. The Education Secretary appeared to criticise parents by claiming that a generation of children had lacked ""discipline and order"" during months of lockdown. The top Tory claimed that learning from home during the pandemic had ""inevitably"" affected the behaviour of many children in a negative way. The Department for Education today announced details of its £10 million ""behaviour hub"" programme which it says will be up and running in time for the summer term. But a leading children's charity suggested there was no evidence that pupils' behaviour had declined – and urged the Government to prioritise their wellbeing instead. Mark Russell, chief executive at The Children's Society, said: ""The pandemic has been harmful to children and young people in so many ways. ""It has left many feeling isolated, missing friends and family and more exposed to risks both inside and outside the home. ""Despite this, we are not aware of any evidence that their behaviour is worse and our practitioners report that on the whole young people have been relieved to get back inside the classroom."" He added: ""The modern world isn't some Dickensian classroom, it's a diverse place full of different people with different skills and in responding to the pandemic the Government has a golden opportunity to change schooling for the better to reflect this."" Labour accused the Government of failing to do enough for children during the pandemic. Shadow education secretary Kate Green said: ""Gavin Williamson's criticism of parents who have worked night and day to keep families going in lockdown, and of children who have been working hard to learn from home, is yet another disgraceful attempt to distract from his own failures."" Writing in the Telegraph, Mr Williamson said today that long periods in lockdown meant that schools now had to ensure ""out of control"" behaviour did not impact learning. ""There is nothing Dickensian about a classroom that is a well-ordered, disciplined environment, where firm and fair teaching gives every child the chance to learn and develop at their own pace without fear of distraction,"" he said. DfE officials have appointed 22 ""lead schools"" across the country, all of which have strong behaviour policies and receive glowing Ofsted reports. These schools will be responsible for assisting and advising other struggling schools to improve their discipline regimes, for example, by banning mobile phones and implementing quiet corridors. But teachers' leaders accused Mr Williamson of ""not doing his homework"" on behaviour and warned him against ""lecturing"" heads on re-establishing routines. They said focusing on mobile phones was ""a distraction"" as schools generally have clear policies for phones to be out of sight during the school day already. Geoff Barton, General Secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""The feedback we've been receiving from our members is that the Education Secretary has not done his homework on the issue of behaviour in the classroom. ""Quite contrary to what Mr Williamson has said, heads are reporting a sense of calm and cooperation from students that is deeply impressive. ""Young people are relaxed and pleased to be back at school and, most importantly, behaviour has never been better."" Dr Mary Bousted of the National Education Union added: ""Heads and teachers don't need a lecture about the importance of re-establishing the routines for good learning and behaviour. ""Teachers will wonder why the SoS doesn't talk about what schools actually need to help students' make positive choices and learning habits. ""Things like smaller class sizes, more funding for pastoral support and releasing time for teachers to work with small groups and assess learning gaps."" She added: ""With all the challenges currently facing schools, playing to the gallery by talking tough on behaviour is the least useful approach the Education Secretary can take."" The Children's Society's Mr Russell added: ""When behaviour is difficult, children need support as it is a sign that they are struggling with something. ""The answer is not behaviour hubs but support from teachers and staff to understand why children are behaving in this way and the impact of successive lockdowns. ""This must be followed by better help from professionals to address these issues in school, in the community and at home."" However, Dr Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT teachers' union, backed the Government's 'behaviour hubs' plan. ""The union's experience confirms that while there are many examples of excellent practice across the education system, some schools require further support to secure and sustain high standards of pupil behaviour,"" he said. ""Behaviour hubs have the potential to identify ways that schools can learn from and support each other in maintaining and improving pupil discipline.""",Real Mirror,831.0

Dr Sewell claimed while racism is a ""real force"" in Britain, particularly online, there is no proof that institutional racism exists. He said: ""Disparities do exist, they are varied, and ironically very few are directly to do with racism. Too often 'racism' is the catch-all explanation."" The study concluded factors other than race – including family, geography and deprivation – had a bigger impact on life chances. ""No one denies and no one is saying racism doesn't exist,"" he said. ""We found anecdotal evidence of this. However, evidence of actual institutional racism? No, that wasn't there, we didn't find that.""

Prof Kehinde Andrews, a professor of Black Studies at Birmingham City University, said the report is not a ""genuine effort"" to understand racism. He said: ""It's complete nonsense. It goes in the face of all existing evidence. This is a PR move to pretend the problem doesn't exist.""

And it concludes the aspirations and hard work of many ethnic communities have transformed society so it offers far greater opportunities for all. But the body, set up last year following the death of George Floyd in the US, also admitted that Britain was not ""a post-racial society"" and ""overt and outright"" racism still persists. However, it challenges the view that Britain has failed to make progress in tackling racial inequality. Controversially, the report says the well-meaning ""idealism"" of many young people who claim the country is still institutionally racist is not borne out by the evidence. Campaigners had already predicted it would reflect the views of Munira Mirza, the head of the No 10 policy unit who set the commission up, who has been critical of the concept of structural racism. The report claims issues around race were becoming less important and were not always a significant factor in explaining disparities. And it says that different outcomes have as much to do with social class and family structure as with race. ""We found that most of the disparities we examined, which some attribute to racial discrimination, often do not have their origins in racism,"" the report states. The commission said that some communities continue to be ""haunted"" by ""historic cases"" of racism, creating ""deep mistrust"" in the system which could prove a barrier to success. ""Both the reality and the perception of unfairness matter,"" they add. The report claims that while disparities exist at the top of public and private sectors, there are increasing levels of diversity in elite professions such as law and medicine. The pay gap between all ethnic minorities and the white majority population has shrunk to 2.3% and in 2019, among those younger than 30, there was no significant pay gap. It has been reported that the commission, which publishes its full report today, is considering a plan to order larger companies to disclose any pay gaps between white employees and their BAME colleagues.",Real Mirror,451.0
509,Real,The Mirror,"EXCLUSIVE: Labour deputy Angela Rayner has written a letter ( see below ) to Boris Johnson demanding he reassures the public on favours he reportedly did for lover Jennifer Arcuri when Mayor of London, PPE contracts - and David Cameron Boris Johnson faces calls to ""urgently reassure"" the public that Jennifer Arcuri did not receive special treatment in the awarding of public money as a result of their affair. Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said it was vital he shows that he acted with ""complete probity"" in dealings with the US tech entrepreneur when he was Mayor of London. In a letter to the PM, Ms Rayner links the favours Boris reportedly did for his lover to wider claims of Tory cronyism. She wrote: ""People deserve to know taxpayers' money is spent with honesty and integrity on the basis of what you know, not who you know."" Mr Johnson is understood to be reluctant to appear in front of a London Assembly committee which is looking into his affair with Ms Arcuri, from 2012 to 2016, who confirmed it in the Sunday Mirror. His press secretary Allegra Stratton said he would ""engage"" with the oversight committee but did not confirm he would give evidence if asked. She also claimed he acted with ""honesty and integrity"" after he was accused of having sex with Ms Arcuri on his family sofa. Ms Rayner raised fears about Tory ""cronyism"" after at least £2billion of Government contracts were awarded to party donors and ""friends"" during the pandemic. She urged Mr Johnson to publish details of companies that had been successful through a ""VIP"" lane. And she said there were ""very serious questions"" to answer about the conduct of David Cameron. Labour is demanding an inquiry after reports the former Tory PM granted access to Whitehall departments for scandal-hit banker Lex Greensill. In her letter, Ms Rayner said there was ""significant and justified"" public concern over whether firms with links to the Tory party had received special treatment. Ms Arcuri was given £126,000 in public money, £10,000 of it from a body overseen by the mayor, and privileged access to three overseas trade missions led by Mr Johnson. She maintains she was invited on the trips in her own right. The Independent Office for Police Conduct concluded last year there was no evidence Mr Johnson committed misconduct in public office, a criminal offence. But the watchdog said it would have been ""wise"" for him to have declared the affair and his failure to do so may have breached the Nolan Principles for Public Life. Ms Rayner also challenged Mr Johnson on claims by No10 that the IOPC found the allegations to be ""untrue and unfounded"" – when that phrase is not in the report. The Greater London Authority is now set to resume its inquiry into whether Mr Johnson behaved with ""honesty and integrity"" and if there was any preferential treatment given to Ms Arcuri. The probe was paused while the IOPC investigated and then delayed by the pandemic. Labour wants No10 to publish details of talks that led to Tory-linked firms being fast-tracked to plum pandemic deals including in PPE. Analysis last month found the value of contracts awarded to firms with connections to the Tories hit almost £2bn. The National Audit Office found those referred this way, including pals of MPs, were 10 times more likely to win deals. Read more Campaigners have taken legal action against the Cabinet Office over the decision to pay more than £500,000 to research firm Public First, run by friends of Dominic Cummings and Michael Gove. A ruling is set to be made. Outsourcing giant Serco also got contracts, including a £108m deal to help run Test and Trace. Its chief executive Rupert Soames is the brother of former Tory MP Sir Nicholas. Health Minister Edward Argar was also a senior executive there until 2015. Randox Laboratories Ltd received a number of contracts for Covid-19 testing, including two for £346.5m and £133m. Tory MP Owen Paterson is a paid adviser but Randox denied he was involved in securing the contracts. Serco said it was ""awarded the vast majority of work… through competition"". Dear Prime Minister, I am writing to you regarding comments made by your Press Secretary and official spokesperson yesterday, stating that the Independent Office for Police Conduct had found that claims regarding a potential breach of the rules in handling public money and access to Jennifer Arcuri were ""untrue and unfounded"". The IOPC's report does not include the phrase ""untrue and unfounded"". Acting with integrity and honesty, as your Press Secretary claims you have always done in this matter, would mean that you should be happy to correct the record. Following the handing of £2billion of taxpayers' money in Government contracts to donors and friends of the Conservative Party during the coronavirus pandemic, there is significant and justified public concern regarding cronyism and special treatment for people who have close relationships with and links to the Conservative Party and Ministers when it comes to public money, preferential treatment and access.",Real Mirror,845.0

Around four in 10 elderly black people are unlikely to have had a jab. Vaccination rates for over 70s were estimated to be just 58.8%, the Office for National Statistics found. Overall, the odds of not having received a jab were 5.5 times greater for people from black African backgrounds and four times greater for black Caribbean backgrounds compared with white Brits. Sir Lenny, 62, enlisted support from actors Chiwetel Ejiofor and Thandie Newton, radio personality Trevor Nelson, football pundit Garth Crooks and author Malorie Blackman. He said of the letter: ""Everybody signed it because we all believe this a time for us to be looking after loved ones and there's been a disproportionate amount of black people and brown people dying and we want to stop that. ""We think the misinformation about the science is wrong and we thought there must be something we can do to counter it and this was the big idea."" The letter to ""mums, dads, grandparents, uncles, aunties, brothers, sisters, nephews, nieces, daughters, sons and cousins"", says the ""new normal may mean needing a vaccine to do many of the things we now take for granted"". It adds: ""You have legitimate worries and concerns. But we're asking you to trust the facts about the vaccine from our own professors, doctors, scientists, GPs, not just in the UK but across the world, including the Caribbean and Africa."" Asked why there was caution, Sir Lenny said: ""I think there's mistrust. Certain institutions haven't done right by the black community in the past. ""One of the things that got us so deeply into this is the hesitancy of Government to lock down. ""They waited and that's why we're in this terrible situation, so it's a bit ironic to accuse the black community of hesitating."" Among black Caribbeans over 70 the estimated jab rate is 68.7%, with 72.7% and 74% for Bangladeshi and Pakistani backgrounds. The estimated rate for white people is 91.3%. Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the figures were ""cause for deep alarm."" The PM's spokesman said: ""Our focus is on promoting the benefits of the vaccine.""

Well here now is an opportunity to put those words into action. Black and Asian Britain has been hardest hit by the Covid-19 havoc sweeping across the UK. The Government has done us no favours. First by sticking their collective head in the sand over the death and critical illness toll throughout the black and brown contingent. Second, by ignoring us when they published their priority lists. That, combined with a history of medicine routinely failing our cultures over the years, has produced an understandable vaccine hesitancy. Trust is in short supply when it comes to the people in power. That shouldn't be the same, however, for the health professionals with our best interests at heart. We want our lives to get back to normal. We don't want our elderly to continue having to shield and the sacrifices of our doctors and nurses to have been in vain.

511,Real,The Mirror,"Boris Johnson has urged Brits to be cautious amid fears of a new Covid wave arriving from Europe and Government scientists warned that people still need to keep their distance from loved ones After a long hard winter of isolation, people in England were today finally free to meet friends and family outdoors, but they were last night warned against hugging. Boris Johnson has urged Brits to be cautious as lockdown rules are eased amid fears of a new Covid wave arriving from Europe. Millions of people in England were reunited with loved ones outdoors yesterday for the first time in months. But the Prime Minister admitted it was unclear how robust the UK's defences would be against a new wave which could bring new variants resistant to the vaccines. Government scientists warned that people still need to keep their distance from loved ones – and avoid hugging their grandchildren in case they transmitted the disease. Mr Johnson told a No 10 briefing: ""What we don't know is exactly how strong our fortifications are, how robust our defences are against another wave. ""We have seen what is happening with our European friends. Historically, at least there has been a time lag and then we have had a wave ourselves. ""That is why I stress the importance of everybody maintaining the discipline people have shown for so long"". Ministers will tomorrow study the rise in cases in France ""very closely"" at an official Covid O meeting where they could consider adding the country to the UK's banned ""red list"". France is currently experiencing 36,000 cases a day, while there are 22,000 a day in Italy and 16,000 a day in Germany. The UK recorded 4,654 cases yesterday. Another 23 people died from coronavirus, while the number of first vaccine doses topped 30m. Matt Hancock declared ""the door is not shut"" on foreign holidays this summer, but said it depended on crucial evidence due in coming weeks. The Health Secretary cast fresh doubt on whether trips abroad will be allowed, after reports they could take until August to start. The PM's caution is a sign that he has learned some of the lessons of last year when critics say he delayed putting the country into lockdown and lifted restrictions too quickly. Chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty admitted there was a ""high likelihood"" of a spike in cases as restrictions were eased – but he said these would be ""modest"" if people followed social distancing guidelines. ""I think it would not be realistic to think there will be no impact,"" he added. He said that while vaccines provided a greater degree of protection there was still ""some degree of vulnerability"" for elderly relatives. And he said the ""wall of vaccination"", which was currently ""kind of leaky"", would get stronger once more people had their second doses. Mr Johnson claimed that schools reopening had already caused the graphs to ""curl a bit like old British Rail sandwiches"" among younger age groups. He was unable to rule out another lockdown next winter. ""I don't see anything in the data right now that would cause us to deviate from the roadmap but we need to remain humble in the face of nature and be prepared to do whatever it takes to protect the British public,"" he said. After months apart, millions of people in England can now meet with six people or two households outdoors. The ""stay at home"" order also ends, meaning they can travel for longer distances to meet up outside - as long as they don't stay overnight. Sir Mark Walport, former government chief scientific adviser and a member of SAGE, warned that social distancing ""still does matter"" outdoors. He added: ""At the end of the day, the virus gets from one person to another by proximity and proximity can happen outside as well, hence your discussion about hugging."" Advising when we he thinks we should hug elderly relatives, he said: ""When the evidence shows that the case numbers are really, really low indeed, that's the point, and so some degree of caution makes sense."" Government minister Nigel Huddleston urged people to hold back from hugging friends and relatives. ""I want to hug my mum so believe me, politicians are human beings too and we are desperately as keen to do this as everybody else,"" he said. ""Please, uncomfortable as it is, please don't do the hugging because what you're doing is then risking the health of the very people that you love. ""So, just a matter of time, we'll be looking at social distancing and other measures as time goes on."" Organised outdoor sport was also allowed from yesterday with facilities including football pitches, basketball courts, golf courses and outdoor swimming pools reopening across England.

512,Real,The Mirror,"Labour leader Keir Starmer faces calls to move key shadow cabinet figures as MPs complain about their failure to land blows on the Tories during their first year in post Keir Starmer has backed shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds after claims he was considering moving her in a reshuffle of his top team. On the local election trail yesterday he said she had his ""full confidence"" and was doing a ""fantastic job"". But the Labour leader faces internal unhappiness that key figures are failing to land blows on the Government. Labour MPs have told the Mirror they are growing frustrated with shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds and shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds in particular. While both senior MPs are seen as a ""safe pair of hands"" who have a firm grip on their briefs, some in the party fear they are struggling to communicate the party's direction. There is also ""widespread grumbling"" over a handful of less high-profile shadow Cabinet ministers who some backbenchers feel are too inexperienced for their posts. Mr Starmer is believed to be planning to reshuffle his top team later this summer, after Boris Johnson announces his own changes to the Cabinet, potentially in July. It is thought he could demote shadow cabinet ministers who are thought to have underperformed during his first year as party leader. But he threw his weight behind his shadow chancellor on a visit in Milton Keynes yesterday, saying: ""Anneliese Dodds has my confidence, she has my full confidence, she is doing a fantastic job. And we are one team, and we have got really important elections in May."" One shadow cabinet minister told the Mirror: ""The way this has been focused on Anneliese is unfair and a bit sexist. There is a collective failure of the shadow cabinet. We're considered by some to be boring and failing to land any blows."" But another shadow Cabinet minister said: ""Keir needs some tough outriders. Nick and Anneliese are very capable but being a safe pair of hands isn't enough. It means Keir has to do a lot of the heavy lifting himself."" A third senior Labour source added: ""Keir is the leader, he just needs to get out there and lead."" Others suggested Mr Starmer could be held back from a dramatic reshuffle out of loyalty to his top team - even though the Tories are still ahead in the polls with Boris Johnson benefiting from a ""vaccine bounce"". One Labour insider said: ""Lots of people have spoken to Keir about this is the last few weeks and they've hit a brick wall. He's very loyal to those who show loyalty to him"". The Labour leader, who took over the party a year ago this weekend, has been urged to bring in ""big figures"" amid concerns his office staff lack experience. Some MPs claim that chief of staff Morgan McSweeney and political director Jenny Chapman are ""letting him down"", suggesting he needs stronger enforcers who ""can be a bit ruthless"". They cited figures like Anji Hunter, Tony Blair's gatekeeper, and Karie Murphy, who worked for Jeremy Corbyn, who they claimed had been ""hard as nails"". However, others suggested that critics had underestimated the amount of work that needed to be done to get the party back on track after years of infighting under Jeremy Corbyn. They also highlighted the difficulties of opposition during the pandemic – when the public often expected Labour to put national interest ahead of party fortunes. The latest reports focus on Ms Dodds, an Oxford-educated economist, who some believe has struggled to take on Chancellor Rishi Sunak and set out the party's vision. Shadow Cabinet office minister Rachel Reeves, who has led Labour's campaign against Tory cronyism and is a former Bank of England economist, could be in line to replace her. Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy - one of the party's top communicators - is also thought to be in the frame, although she lacks relevant experience. Ex-Cabinet minister Yvette Cooper has also been discussed, however it is unclear whether she would be willing to step down from her chairmanship of the Home Affairs Select Committee.

Boris Johnson warned a spike in cases could happen, as parts of Europe are struck by a third wave of infections, but he hopes the vaccines rollout will suppress hospital stays and deaths.

""Everyone must continue to stick to the rules."" Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden cautioned: ""While we want to enable people to visit granny or participate in outdoor sports, people should think carefully about whether it is worth the cost in terms of having unnecessary social interactions.""

He said: ""This virus still has the capacity to wreak more havoc on a significant scale."" Prof Mark Woolhouse, of the SPI-M committee, told the BBC: ""I'm a little bit nervous about a full relaxation in June. The idea we can suddenly emerge in one great bound is a little over-optimistic.""

But the Sunday Times reported that Mr Greensill's firm then benefited financially from the Government-backed loan scheme he designed.

Allegra Stratton, the Prime Minister's press secretary, was said to be ""in the frame"" for a role in the former Labour leader's office. In the latest edition of his diaires, out on Thursday, Alastair Campbell said that Ms Stratton, who is close to the Prime Minister, had also ""almost worked"" for Mr Miliband as Climate Secretary. His claims could be uncomfortable for Ms Stratton, who will become the public face of the Tory Government if it presses ahead with daily televised briefings, as they raise questions about her Tory credentials. Mr Miliband was Labour leader from 2010 until 2015, when he stood down after losing the election to David Cameron, heralding the advent of the Corbyn era. On November 30, 2010, Mr Campbell wrote that he had spoken with the senior MP about appointing somebody as his top media aide. ""People in his team seem sure Allegra Stratton is also in the frame for something,"" he writes. ""Quite good friends with him apparently, and she had almost worked for him when he was Climate Change Secretary."" Mr Campbell, who was Tony Blair 's Director of Communications at No 10, added: ""Always assumed she is fairly classic Guardian, if more New Labour than most."" Ms Stratton worked for the Guardian before joining the BBC, then ITV. She left journalism to work for Chancellor Rishi Sunak before moving to No 10 last year. On December 3, 2010, Mr Campbell added: ""The Allegra Stratton thing had fizzled out. Apparently she has landed a column."" But by January 11 the following year, her name was in the frame again: ""Tom [Baldwin] said Allegra Stratton, who sounds like she is still keen to get in there, had been on to him and anyone else who will listen, saying that 'the real Ed' was warm, funny and clever, but that was not coming over."" Ms Stratton, who along with the PM's fiancee Carrie Symonds was said to be involved in the departure of top aides Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain from No 10, did not take the job. The Mirror understands that she turned it down because she did not feel she was sufficiently pro-Labour. Mr Johnson is believed to have been told about the job offer when the ex-journalist joined his team but was unconcerned. Five years later, when she was working for BBC Newsnight, Mr Campbell had lunch with Ms Stratton. ""She felt Ed was doing better but that he was still not punching through,"" he writes in his diary, which covers 2010-2015. ""The sense in the lobby was that Cameron was not that great, Ed was better than the public perception, but neither was he setting the world on fire. ""She said she was a supporter, and though constrained by where she was, more than at The Guardian, keen to help."" Ms Stratton confirmed to the Mirror that she had been offered a job by Mr Miliband. She has previously admitted that she was also offered a job by Mr Miliband's older brother, David, when he was foreign secretary, but turned it down. And she has described herself as a ""Johnson Tory"" who voted for Brexit, although she has previously voted for Labour and the Green party in her 20s.",Real Mirror,583.0

In that year a staggering 126,000 people have lost their lives to this virus and counting. When we are constantly bombarded with statistics in the media, it's easy to lose sight of the human story behind each number. However, we mustn't forget that behind the death toll, there are families, parents, children, grandchildren, siblings, friends, partners, and millions of people grieving the loss of their loved ones. This is something I have experienced first-hand, as an entire generation of my family died this year. Almost a year ago after we entered lockdown, my Mum passed away. Without proper testing infrastructure at the time, I'll never know if she died from Covid-19. But that doesn't matter. As she lay in her hospital bed, I couldn't hold her hand, I couldn't comfort her, I couldn't tell her I loved her, I couldn't say goodbye. A year later and people are still losing loved ones in these terrible circumstances. Just last month, my mother and father-in-law both contracted Covid-19 and died within just days of one another. The shock of this was brought home when my wife and I buried my father-in-law next to the fresh flowers still laying at my mother-in-law's grave. Muslim funerals are traditionally big affairs as the community comes together to mourn and comfort one another. Burying my mother and my parents-in-law without bringing together my wider family, friends, and community has been particularly painful. As a society we have been robbed of the opportunity to collectively mourn, instead we are left to grieve alone and isolated. My family is not the only one to have lost someone, or even an entire generation, to this virus. Millions are grieving for their loved ones. Those of us left behind want and deserve to understand what happened and how as a country we reached such a tragic milestone. A full public inquiry into the handling of the pandemic must allow us to understand if there was anything more that could have been done to save lives and how we can prevent such a tragedy from happening again.

To mark the anniversary, London's skyline will turn yellow with landmarks including the London Eye, Trafalgar Square and Wembley Stadium lighting up at nightfall. Cardiff Castle and Belfast City Hall will also be illuminated, while churches and cathedrals will toll bells, light thousands of candles and offer prayers. A No 10 spokesman said the PM would mark the one-year anniversary of the first lockdown privately with a minute's silence. ""He believes people should personally reflect in whatever way feels right for them,"" he said. Mr Johnson said: ""The last 12 months has taken a huge toll on us all, and I offer my sincere condolences to those who have lost loved ones. Today, the anniversary of the first lockdown, is an opportunity to reflect on the past year – one of the most difficult in our country's history. ""We should also remember the great spirit shown by our nation over this past year. We have all played our part, whether it's working on the front line as a nurse or carer, working on vaccine development and supply, helping to get that jab into arms, home schooling your children, or just by staying at home to prevent the spread of the virus.' ""It's because of every person in this country that lives have been saved, our NHS was protected, and we have started on our cautious road to easing restrictions once and for all."" Doctors, nurses and carers are among those who back the campaign for an annual memorial day and Whitehall monument. Over 50 MPs and peers from all parties have written to the PM urging him to formally remember lives lost and changed by the pandemic. Layla Moran MP, Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus, said: ""A Covid Memorial Day will bring communities across the UK together to mourn the lives lost and lives changed by this pandemic and ensure they are never forgotten. ""This is also a chance to show our recognition and gratitude to the heroes on the frontline who have kept our NHS, schools and other vital services running. ""We owe it to all those who made the ultimate sacrifice to remember them with dignity, learn the lessons of this crisis and ensure the country is better prepared when the next pandemic strikes."" Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association said: ""For many of us working in the NHS, there has been nothing in living memory that has had such a profound and devastating impact on our nation and health service as the coronavirus pandemic – a pandemic that will undoubtedly shape our future for years to come. ""The Covid Memorial Day should serve as an important reminder for the many who sadly lost their lives throughout this pandemic and for their loved ones who bear this loss. ""It is also a day to acknowledge the remarkable efforts of all the health and care staff, key workers and those who have and continue to work tirelessly, often putting their own health at risk to come to the aid of others and save lives. ""Crucially, this day should be marked in history to ensure that we never take for granted our health service and are constantly progressing and learning lessons that will serve us well in the future."" Labour's Rachel Reeves said: ""Today we reflect on what has been a terrible year for our country and the huge sacrifices the British people have made.

PM Boris Johnson today warned that the deadly third wave currently spreading across Europe would ""wash up on our shores"". He also revealed he had talked to EU leaders and was ""reassured"" they did not want a vaccines blockade which could delay our rollout of jabs. Mr Johnson said: ""We're facing the same pandemic, we all have the same problems."" The daily death toll from Covid-19 fell to 17 today, the lowest in six months, just as the nation was warned a third wave of the virus may sweep in from the Continent. PM Johnson said people should be ""under no illusion"" we will ""feel the effects"" of rising cases across the Channel, where vaccination rates are lagging far behind the UK's. He called for international co-operation, but insisted Britain was still on course to vaccinate the nine priority groups, including over-50s, by April 15. On a visit to BAE Systems in Preston, Lancs, he said: ""We're facing the same pandemic, we all have the same problems. ""A vaccination programme, developing vaccines, rolling them out, these are international projects and require international cooperation"". The PM also said the Government would ""bash on"" with its roadmap for lifting restrictions despite concerns the vaccines row could lead to delays. He is under pressure from Tory backbenchers to lift restrictions sooner as cases continue to fall. Government scientists have warned rushing out of lockdown risks another spike in infections, undermining the vaccine programme. A further 5,342 new cases were recorded yesterday and more than 28 million people have now had a first jab and 2.3 million have had a second one. But summer holidays could still be off until vaccination rates in other countries improve. And holiday plans may be derailed entirely by the soaring infection rates across Europe. Home Secretary Priti Patel suggested France, which has high rates of the South African strain, could be put on the ""red list"" of banned countries. Holidays abroad will officially be illegal after the Government tonight brought in new laws to enforce the rules already in place. Anybody who travels abroad without a reasonable excuse could face a £5,000 fine. There is also a £200 fixed penalty notice for failing to fill in a travel declaration form, giving personal details and the reason for travel. Ministers also formally banned different households meeting indoors for Easter, putting into law the policy of no indoor mixing until May 17. No10 sources confirmed the PM held ""private talks"" with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel about the vaccines on Sunday. But the dispute over vaccine supply showed little sign of easing as European countries struggle to vaccinate their populations. EU leaders will meet online on Thursday to discuss a possible ban on exports of the AstraZeneca vaccine to the UK. Brussels chief Ursula von der Leyen ramped up rhetoric at the weekend warning of the power to ""forbid"" exports. She said: ""That is the message to AstraZeneca.""

Brussels officials said they were not seeking a ban, but wanted pharmaceutical firms to meet their contractual obligations to the bloc. The row is now focused on the Halix plant in the Netherlands, which makes an active ingredient for the AstraZeneca jab. But Whitehall sources played down claims that Britain could share its Dutch-made vaccine supplies to prevent the EU bringing in a ban. They said to treat with ""caution"" reports that the Government was prepared to negotiate how to divide up stocks with European countries. The plant has made enough for between five and 10 million vaccines. Labour leader Keir Starmer said the Government was right when it said that the contracts had to be honoured and the EU was not ""helping itself"". He said: ""I don't think they should go down this road of banning exports."" Health Minister Helen Whatley also dismissed ""rhetoric"" over a ban. She said: ""No country should follow vacccine nationalism."" Irish Taoiseach Micheal Martin said a ban would be a ""retrograde step"". British officials travelled to Brussels at the weekend for vaccine talks with the European Commission. And Lord Eddie Lister is to travel to the Serum Institute in India to try to unblock the supply of five million vaccine doses from there.",Real Mirror,814.0

The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has signed a 10-month contract with Hunter Healthcare Resourcing Limited for £962,830 - despite refusing to increase the pay of NHS nurses. Boris Johnson has previously said that increasing nurses' wages above 1% - a real terms cut - was unaffordable. The Prime Minister was accused of ""squandering"" taxpayers' cash on the reorganisation - when hundreds of experienced Public Health England staff are available. Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said: ""This beggars belief. ""Nurses, paramedics, porters and health care assistants are slapped with pay cuts while ministers allow tax payers cash to be squandered on this reorganisation."" The recruitment firm will reportedly fill five finance roles for the organisation, which will tackle health threats such as infectious diseases. But it remains unclear who will take on PHE's work on tackling obesity, reducing smoking and dealing with health inequalities after it is scrapped. The Government's decision last year to axe PHE and replace it with a new body prompted widespread criticism and claims that it was simply ""shifting deckchairs"". The decision followed weeks of speculation that ministers, including the PM, were unhappy with its performance over testing early on in the pandemic. However, the Government was directly responsible for PHE. which answered to Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Doctors and hospital bosses branded the move unfair, unjustified, and part of a Government effort to distract from its own failings over Covid-19. Dido Harding, boss of the failing £37bn Test and Trace system, has been temporarily put in charge of the new body. Mr Hancock is expected to announce further details this week. A DHSC spokesman said: ""Every pound spent is helping to save lives, but we have always been clear that all contracts must achieve value for taxpayers and are based on good commercial judgement.""",Real Mirror,363.0

Popular holiday destinations with lower Covid rates and higher vaccination roll-out could be reopened to British tourists sooner this summer. Under the tiered system, passengers could be exempt from pre-departure tests and quarantine on their return. But those flying to higher risk ""red"" countries could face tough restrictions including a 10-day self-isolation period and extra Covid tests after their break. Government sources confirmed officials were considering the traffic light scheme, which would be subject to change as infection rates rise or fall. However, they warned it was ""quite early days"" and suggested the priority would be to reopen the UK economy. The proposed blueprint comes amid fears millions of us will be forced to stay at home as a third wave of the virus rages across Europe. Ministers warned it would be ""premature"" to book summer breaks as soaring rates in countries including France and Poland raise the likelihood of vaccine-resistant strains. Cabinet minister Ben Wallace said of booking breaks: ""It would be premature to do that. It'd be potentially risky, we are seeing growing variants. We are not going to do anything that puts at risk this national effort on the pandemic. Let's take it step by step."" The Defence Secretary also warned the EU not to ""build walls"" around the distribution of vaccines amid an escalating war of words. There are concerns the UK's vaccines roll-out could be delayed for weeks if the EU presses ahead with a threat to ban exports. The Department of Health is today launching trials of new tests which can spot new Covid mutations quickly. The technology, called genotype assay testing, halves the time it currently takes to identify if a positive Covid sample contains a variant of concern.

A leading member of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine team has warned that the biggest risk to the UK is the South Africa strain raging across Europe. The mutation, which could impact on the effectiveness of vaccines, is thought to make up between 5% and 10% of cases in France, which has low jab rates. Oxford University's Sir John Bell said Europe's ""hopeless"" response to Covid-19 risks the South African strain ""flooding in the back door"" when travel restarts.

Ministers have been under pressure to force building owners and managers to share information with local fire services as suggested by the first phase of the Inquiry. They have also been urged to demand those who are responsible for buildings to undertake regular inspections and share evacuation plans with residents. Tory minister Stephen Greenhalgh announced the U-turn on the fire safety plans in the House of Lords. The peer confirmed ministers will bring in the changes before the second anniversary of the of the Inquiry's report in October. The devastating inferno at Grenfell Tower in West London killed 72 people in June 2017 after the fire spread quickly up the cladding on the outside of the building. The inquiry found that the building's exterior did not comply with regulations and that the fire service were too late in advising residents to evacuate. When it made its recommendations in October 2019, then housing secretary James Brokenshire promised to implement them ""in full"" and ""without delay"". But after the Tories brought in the Fire Safety Bill - which the Government said would be ""a step further"" towards delivering the changes - Tory MPs voted against them. They were later overturned in the House of Lords - but again rejected by the Government. Labour 's housing spokesperson in the Lords, Roy Kennedy, who tabled the successful amendment, told The Mirror: ""I am delighted that the Government is finally looking to act on the phase one Grenfell Tower Inquiry Report. ""The victims and survivors of that terrible fire have waited far too long but this is welcome progress, and we now have a timetable that will hopefully see the report's recommendations put in place."" Under the changes, building owners will be forced to inform local fire services about materials used on their exterior walls, as well as up-to-date floor plans and where their fire-fighting equipment is located. They will have to conduct regular checks of flat entrance doors and communal fire doors, all lifts and any equipment. Building owners will also have to get expert fire risk assessments, under changes to the Building Safety Bill. And they will be made to draw up, and regularly review, evacuation plans, plus install fire escape signs in all residential buildings of 11m and over. Lord Greenhalgh said: ""The Government's commitment to implementing the Inquiry's recommendations remains undimmed, as does our commitment to ensure those most affected by the tragic events at Grenfell Tower – the bereaved and survivors – continue to have a voice in their implementation.""",Real Mirror,458.0

A report by the Public Accounts Committee praised the initiative for ""quickly and decisively"" housing rough sleepers, saving lives among this vulnerable group. But the programme also revealed that the numbers of people sleeping on the streets - 37,430 - turned out to be around nine times higher than official estimates. MPs slammed the Ministry of Housing for still not having a plan to deliver on the Tory election pledge to end rough sleeping by May 2024. It was also unclear whether the Government would hit its target of providing 3,300 homes for these people by the end of March. Despite £161m funding, the majority are expected to be placed in leased buildings rather than new housing stock, while the accommodation is only expected to be temporary, with average stays of two years. Meg Hillier MP, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said: ""'Everyone In' was a success with local authorities and voluntary organisations working to help people living on the street into hostels and hotel rooms in a matter of days. ""But the initiative has exposed the scale of the task the Ministry of Housing faces to meet the Government's commitment to end rough sleeping in three years. ""Rough sleeping was a massive public health issue long before the pandemic, and much larger than Government has previously publicly acknowledged.

Just 1.4% of rape cases end in conviction – a record low – meaning many offenders end up getting away scot-free.

Under the plans the maximum sentence for defacing monuments will increase from three months to 10 years. Rape sentences start at five. Labour labelled the plans ""nonsense"". More arrests were made in London protests tonight. Labour has slated the Tories' 296-page package of crime and justice plans for not including the word ""women"".

She said: ""The right to protest is the cornerstone of our democracy, but the Government's duty remains to prevent more lives being lost during this pandemic."" The Home Secretary also told MPs: ""To say the bill does nothing for women is completely wrong."" She added attackers who are jailed would no longer serve just half the sentence in custody. Jail terms for those convicted of sexual offences such as rape start at just five years. Hundreds of people attended an event in memory of Sarah outside the Commons as the debate went on inside.

529,Real,The Mirror,"Tory ministers are now seriously considering whether to back peers' proposal to flag, track and target serial abusers in a bid to protect women's safety Serial domestic abusers and stalkers will be flagged, tracked and targeted to prevent more women being harmed under plans supported by the House of Lords tonight. In a defeat for the Government, peers voted to support a Labour plan to see perpetrators put on the violent and sex offenders register and face greater monitoring of their movements. Tory ministers are now understood to be seriously considering whether to back the proposal when the Domestic Abuse Bill returns to the Commons after Easter. They believe the change could help police forces and social services to share information about men convicted of offences such as harassment, stalking and coercive control. The database would be modelled on the sex offenders register which holds information on those cautioned or convicted of sexual offences. A Home Office source said: ""We will look in detail now and take a decision closer to the time"". Labour peer Baroness Royall, whose amendment was backed by 327 votes to 232, said: ""We have had years of guidance and good intention, but too many women live in fear and too many have been abused, stalked or murdered. ""I am delighted peers from across the Lords have recognised action is now needed. It is time to proactively identify, assess and manage domestic abusers and stalkers, and for a national strategy underpinned by law. Nothing less will do if we are to keep women and girls safe. ""I pay tribute to countless survivors and the families of victims of domestic abuse and stalking for campaigning on this issue for many years. Those women and their families best understand that the present system is not working. ""Guidance and pockets of good practice are simply not good enough. A comprehensive strategy and a national register, with the ability to share data, must be laid down in statute. ""Women are tired of domestic abuse and stalking being considered a 'women's issue', and we have spent years being told to change our behaviour. The culture of misogyny has to change and our amendment will now focus attention instead on perpetrators – on the men who commit the vile offences."" The defeat was the latest in a series of setbacks suffered in the upper chamber by the Government over the Domestic Abuse Bill. Laura Richards, a criminal behavioural analyst and founder of the Paladin National Stalking Advocacy Service said: ""Domestic abuse and stalking are patterned crimes and for too long these patterns and dangerous men have been largely ignored. ""We need a mandatory, national join-up across police services and other agencies, to share information and intelligence about serial and high harm perpetrators because they travel and my research shows that they abuse multiple women. ""We also need a perpetrator strategy and to stop talking about violence against women and girls and women's safety in a passive way. Men need to be centred in this, as it's the only way to achieve real change. It's time for men to step up and fix the problem of male violence towards women and girls. ""Women have had enough of being ignored and we have finally been heard. This amendment will ensure violent and abusive men are both visible and accountable. It will save women's and children's lives in the future."" It came as the government's Criminal Justice Taskforce agreed to almost double the 2021-22 Safer Streets Fund to £45m, up from £20m this year. The cash can be spent on CCTV, lighting, and more targeting of parks and alleyways or routes around bars when they reopen. Pilots of a new 'Project Vigilant' programme will also be rolled out in which plainclothes police identify ""predatory and suspicious offenders"" in clubs, bars and pubs. The approach had been used by Thames Valley Police, who went in undercover near bars to ensure women are safe. No10 also announced £11m to provide more Independent Sexual Violence Advisors, supporting victims through the justice system. And there will be a consultation on a proposed Victims' Law this summer, creating legal rights for victims of crime.

530,Real,The Mirror,"Here is Labour’s ten-point charter - backed by the Mirror - to help keep women safe including extending 'whole life sentences' to anyone found guilty of ‘abduction and sexual assault and murder of a stranger’ Ministers are facing a furious backlash from angry women who are fed up with feeling unsafe on Britain's streets. Boris Johnson has said women must feel their complaints about violence are ""properly heard"" - and that his Government will make sure it does this. But there is a difference between hearing somebody and really listening to what they have to say - and many are clamouring for immediate change. The charter has been drawn up by Nick Thomas-Symonds, shadow Home Secretary, and Jess Phillips, shadow minister for Domestic Violence and Safeguarding. So here is Labour 's ten-point charter - backed by the Mirror - to help keep women safe and to end the injustices faced by more than half the population. 1. Action to bring rapists to justice – rape convictions are at an all-time low with just 1.5% of people charged with rape are getting convicted, yet rape reports are up by 35%. We should fast track rape and serious sexual assault cases through the courts and CPS who have been left to wait years for their case to get to trial. 2. New laws to stop harassment - as it stands creeps harassing women on the street are not breaking the law. That makes no sense and we need a new law now. 3. Men who abduct, assault and murder women belong behind bars for life – let's extend 'Whole Life' sentences for anyone found guilty of 'abduction and sexual assault and murder of a stranger'. 4. Proper support for victims of attacks – create a survivor support package, including a legal help for victims and better training for professionals to give people the help they need. 5. Educate our young people – start a proper education campaign to make sure young boys and girls knows it is never acceptable to abuse or disrespect women- as well as the rules around sexual consent. 6. Longer jail time for rapists and stalkers – some of the sentences handed out for these appalling crimes are a disgrace. Let's make sure the time fits the crime. From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times. The newsletter is sent out twice daily with the latest UK & world politics news, along with leading opinion and analysis. You can sign up here. 7. Treat domestic murders seriously –  end the injustice that means someone can get a sentence of 10 years less for murdering their partner at home, than for murdering someone on the street. 8. Make abuse of women count – the abuse of women that drives these crimes is not even counted by the police, that needs to change and misogyny should be recognized as the hateful crime it is. 9. Fair access to Domestic Abuse services – no victim turned away from services for domestic abuse because of their background. Helping get support to all those who need it and making sure we can do more to catch perpetrators. 10. It's not women's fault –  stop the message that women are to blame because of what they wear, when they are out or for not 'keeping themselves safe'. Time for a proper strategy to catch and punish offenders, challenge behaviour and improve the freedom of all women.",Real Mirror,581.0

The committee warned that this had led to confusion and mistrust among the public - despite trust being a ""crucial factor"" in the success of the response to the crisis. Leisure and hospitality sectors had not seen the data underpinning decisions to put restrictions on their businesses, the report noted. The MPs said the Government's priority must be to make sure that in now takes a ""clear and consistent"" framework for making lockdown decisions. They said ministers should publish thresholds for moving between steps in the roadmap out of the current national lockdown. The report added: ""The framework for lockdown and tiering decisions has changed repeatedly throughout this pandemic. ""While we do not object to the inclusion of new metrics (such as vaccines), changes in the framework to date have not always appeared to reflect new information. ""This has amounted to a moving of the goalposts, which creates uncertainty, makes it impossible to see trends and therefore must stop.""

532,Real,The Mirror,"EXCLUSIVE: Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner urged ministers to bring in a “significant real terms” pay increase to help prevent thousands of staff leaving the NHS Labour says the Government should ""not put a ceiling"" on NHS pay rises as Boris Johnson comes under sustained pressure to U-turn on a planned cut. Deputy leader Angela Rayner urged ministers to bring in a ""significant real terms"" pay increase to help prevent thousands of staff leaving the NHS. She went further than Keir Starmer who has previously said that the 2.1% budgeted for by the NHS should be a ""starting point"". Ms Rayner criticised plans for a one-off bonus for NHS staff, believed to be under discussion by ministers, saying it would not help make ends meet. In an interview with the Mirror, she admitted that while health unions did not want to strike over pay, if they were forced to she would back them. Boris Johnson has been criticised for capping pay at 1% next year - a real terms cut - claiming that an increase would not be affordable. But Ms Rayner insisted ""we can't afford not to"" as without more support thousands of nurses and other staff could leave the profession. She called on the Government to publish a multi-year pay deal for all NHS staff or risk a staffing crisis. Labour is planning to force a vote in coming weeks on the issue with an amendment to the Queen's Speech expected in May. Labour MP Carolyn Harris will use a backbench bill next month to put the matter to a vote. Ms Rayner pledged: ""Make no bones about it, the pressure is not going to go away."" The former care worker said she was ""incredibly frustrated"" by the Government's failure to address the social care crisis despite repeated promises. She insisted that proper funding of community care could help prevent the elderly and vulnerable going into hospital in the first place. ""It's not just a social issue, it's a hard economic argument to be made here as well,"" she said.  But she promised to ""do anything"" to try to resolve the issue, including sitting down to work cross-party - even though the Tories hadn't been in touch. There was a backlash last week against Chancellor Rishi Sunak after his budget failed to mention social care once. He also failed to provide a cash injection into the current system, with experts warning that an immediate £1bn is needed. It came as new figures show NHS staff are at breaking point with almost half a million sick days lost due to mental ill health. The latest official figures show frontline health workers took over 471,000 sick days due to mental ill health last October. Absence due to mental ill-health accounted for one in four staff sickness absences. The number of days lost due to mental ill-health increased by 11% in the year since October 2019. And 44% of NHS staff reported feeling unwell due to work related stress in 2020. Ms Rayner warned that the pressure on NHS staff would continue even after the pandemic. ""We have an NHS workforce that has literally been in crisis the last 12 months,"" she said. ""They've really pushed themselves to the limits and it's not going to stop now. ""Our NHS is going to be working around the clock to deal with the backlog."" The Labour MP said ministers should agree to a multi-year pay deal for all NHS staff - with no cap on negotiations. The Royal College of Nursing has called for a 12.5% increase and - unusually - threatened strike action over the issue. Ms Rayner said the 2.1% budgeted for was a ""small amount"", adding: ""The honest way of approaching this is not to put a ceiling on it. ""We should go into them with the expectation that there is a significant real terms pay increase for those NHS workers."" Dismissing plans for a one-off bonus for NHS staff, she said: ""I think it's really gimmicky and like saying 'we'll give you a medal'. ""A medal is not going to pay the bills. They don't want extra, they just want to be paid what they're worth."" She added: ""NHS staff initially felt privileged and honoured by the NHS claps, but as time went and nothing materialised on they felt demoralised. ""If they're having to go to a food bank or are struggling to pay the rent then that's not going to cut it. Ms Rayner insisted that the RCN, a moderate union, was ""desperate"" to enter into pay negotiations in good faith and avoid industrial action. Mr Starmer has previously refused to be drawn over whether Labour would back strike action in hospitals. But his deputy said: ""If they're forced into it because the Government have failed to even negotiate with them then I think that is a really sad day. ""I would support any of the unions and their members in their right to take industrial action. ""But I think the point here is that the Government has the opportunity to stop that from happening.

Prof Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, suggested the ""top up"" dose would be needed as soon as possible. This would both protect the elderly against a new variant and act as a safety net amid uncertainty over how long immunity lasts after getting a jab. The top medic suggested that rolling out the third jab in August or September, rather than later in the year, would prepare Britain for a potential ""large third wave"". ""We certainly don't want to see a winter like we've seen this winter, and if we've got new variants circulating and we've got dropping levels of immunity due to the vaccination, then that becomes an imperative to do a booster,"" he told the British Medical Journal. ""I think we're likely to make a bold decision to recommend a booster dose, even if we haven't got all the evidence of the necessity, just because I think the consequences of not immunising with the booster dose are so big. ""If it's proved that it's needed months later it may be too late."" The UK's national statistician said he had ""no doubt"" there will be a further wave of Covid-19 infections in the autumn. Prof Sir Ian Diamond, head of the Office for National Statistics, welcomed the vaccine roll-out programme. But he added: ""We need also to recognise that this is a virus that isn't going to go away. ""And I have no doubt that in the autumn there will be a further wave of infections."" He suggested there is a lot of regional variation on the amount of antibodies people have. England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty predicted last week the UK would experience another surge of cases at some point.

A leading Tory mayor joined an online event last night with a pub landlord whose licence was previously on the line over a 'punch your ex in the face for a free steak' advert. As women gathered across the country for vigils after the murder of Sarah Everard, Teesside mayor Ben Houchen was interviewed live on Facebook by local businessman Craig Harker. The landlord's pub, the George Pub and Grill in Stockton-on-Tees, faced having its licence reviewed in 2019 after publishing the incendiary advert. Cleveland Police and officers at Stockton Council asked councillors to review the pub's ability to sell alcohol- although it was eventually allowed to stay open. Wendy Shepherd, an expert in Violence Against Women and Girls who has advised the UN and Foreign Office, called on Mr Houchen to apologise. She said: ""For somebody in his position to be sharing a platform with a man who is known for inciting violence against women with his advert, is at best naive and at worst plain wrong. ""He should apologise, particularly when this event was held on an evening where so many women were holding vigils and are outraged by what has happened to Sarah Everard. ""It's always put onto women that we have to protect ourselves, but we have to start educating men."" Jessie Jacobs, Labour 's candidate for Tees Valley mayor, said Mr Houchen's decision was ""beyond reprehensible"" . She added: ""At a time when the nation was grieving and women were raising their voices against violence against women, the Tories' leading figure in the North does this. ""How can we ever expect the Tories to deal with violence against women when he aligns himself to this type of behaviour? ""It is a body blow to every women fighting for a safer world and questions need to be asked"". Mr Houchen later tweeted: ""I think it's disgusting that anyone would seek to link an innocent interview with live questions from the public to the awful murder of a wonderful young woman for political gain. ""I did a 10 min radio interview yesterday with a local business owner and the public about Freeports, music and high streets."" At the time of the row, Mr Harker refuted that his post on Facebook promoted domestic violence – saying only a tiny fraction of people who saw it had complained. Mr Harker added: ""We've done social media well for years – the way it works for us is if our views are up, are takings are up. ""There were just four or five complaints but 4 million people saw the post – it's ridiculous.""",Real Mirror,474.0

The Labour leader, whose mum and sister were nurses, said it was ""morally wrong"" of the Prime Minister to cut nurses' pay in real terms. The Government has been criticised for capping pay at 1% next year - a real terms cut - while committing huge sums to vanity projects and failures. The PM has claimed the offer - which frontline health workers have branded ""derisory"" - was ""as much as we can give"". But in an interview with the Mirror, Mr Starmer said: ""Boris Johnson has got his priorities completely wrong. ""He's saying we can't afford to pay nurses more.

""You can't afford to waste money on a vanity project of a crossing over the Irish Sea or on Test and Trace which hasn't delivered."" He compared the proposed £3.50 week pay rise for nurses with the £6,000 a day given to some consultants on the testing programme. At PMQs, Mr Johnson appeared to leave the door open for a U-turn after the pay proposal was met with anger from Tory MPs. He promised to listen to the independent pay review body which reports in May. But Mr Starmer told the Mirror the PM was ""hiding behind"" the system, adding: ""This is completely on him"". He added: ""He's had his life saved by the NHS, he's said time and again we will reward them and support them. ""But what does that look like? A pay cut. It could not be more insulting."" In the Commons, the Labour leader blasted: ""My mum was a nurse. My sister was a nurse. My wife works in the NHS. ""When I clapped for carers I meant it. He clapped for carers then he shut the door in their face at the first opportunity"". He later told us he was also ""very angry"" how the Government was treating NHS workers after all their sacrifices during the pandemic. And he talked of how they had supported his own mother who had spent years struggling with a serious, and incurable, illness. ""The NHS was a lifeline for my Mum for many years when she desperately needed it,"" he said. ""She was in high dependency units with nurses working in front of me saving her life.

536,Real,The Mirror,"EXCLUSIVE: Insiders say health and safety chiefs privately pledged to review decision to classify Covid as a 'significant' risk to workers Health and Safety Executive bosses have privately agreed to review the classification of Covid-19 as merely a ""significant"" workplace risk. The Mirror understands that chief executive Sarah Albon signed up to the move at a board meeting earlier this week. Board members had shared concerns that inspectors felt constrained from using their full powers to keep workplaces safe. Many were said to be worried they wouldn't have the full backing of HSE managers as the body hadn't classified the pandemic as a ""serious"" risk. An HSE insider said: ""The board had raised serious concerns about the categorisation and the impact it was having. ""They called for an urgent review of that, which was agreed by the chief executive Sarah Albon at the board meeting on Tuesday"". More than 11,000 working age people have died of Covid and thousands of workplaces have suffered outbreaks. But not a single employer has been prosecuted - or workplace shut down. The HSE has handled 180,000 Covid-related incidents which have resulted in just 218 enforcement notices, figures show. Until now it has deemed the pandemic to be a ""significant"" rather than a ""serious"" risk. Yet the failure of inspectors to take tough steps could potentially have drastic consequences for workers. Union chiefs claim the classification effectively removes an inspector's ability to close down an unsafe workplace or work activity. But the HSE says the full range of powers has always been available to them. And they claimed Covid was initially classified as ""significant"" because, unlike risks like asbestos, it affected all workers differently. TUC chief Frances O'Grady said: ""Classifying Covid-19 as a 'significant' workplace risk tied the hands of workplace health and safety inspectors, and effectively prevented them from using their full powers to close down unsafe workplaces. ""The massive increase in workplace clusters of Covid shows that workers will have been infected as a consequence of that decision. ""If ministers want to make sure we never go into lockdown again, they must do a better job of keeping people safe as they return to workplaces in large numbers. ""It's time to end the foot-dragging approach to enforcement that has characterised workplace safety in this pandemic."" The HSE press office denied it was planning a review of its classification of Covid-as a ""significant"" workplace risk. It claimed that Covid guidance for inspectors would be considered as part of a ""routine"" review in due course. ""We looked at how to categorise Covid at the start of the pandemic and reviewed this last autumn,"" it said. ""As with all classifications, this will be routinely considered as would be the case with any new hazard."" The HSE has lost 46% of its funding since the Tories came to power in 2010 - more than £100m - and inspections have declined by 70%.

Tory ex-Chancellor Philip Hammond urged the Government to ditch ""very extravagant"" promises from its manifesto ahead of next week's Budget. Rishi Sunak, the new occupant of No 11, is expected to extend Covid support until the end of lockdown in June in his financial statement. This is set to include £30bn on extending the furlough jobs support scheme and business relief, as well as the Universal Credit uplift and the stamp duty holiday. But there are also likely to be tax hikes, including putting corporation tax up to around 24% and an increase in capital gains tax. Tory MPs threatening rebellion over tax rises on business have been warned they face the chop. No 10 says Budget votes will be a ""confidence issue"", meaning any rebels risk losing the party whip. Former PM David Cameron warned the Chancellor that tax rises ""wouldn't make any sense at all"" as the nation opens back up from lockdown. Labour leader Keir Starmer has also said ""now is not the time"" for tax increases - prompting an angry response from left-wingers. One Government source said: ""Action needs to be taken now, not in November and not next year, but now. ""The Budget will make a start on that stabilisation. It can't go the whole way in one fiscal event but it will make a start."" The Government has already spent almost £300bn on coronavirus measures - dramatically more than the £12bn announced by Mr Sunak in his first Budget. The Treasury is also expected to open a new office in the North in a symbolic move designed to show its commitment to the region. But Lord Hammond urged the PM to level with the public amid rising unemployment and the economy being hit by the biggest annual decline on record. He told the BBC: ""My fear is that, as a populist government, giving money away is always easier than collecting it in."" ""Not all of those [manifesto] commitments can now sensibly be delivered on.

One told the Mirror: ""There will probably be some schools, but we don't think there will be some massive drama there."" However, school leaders said it was highly unlikely any secondaries would get all pupils back in the classroom by March 8 - and it could take much longer. Julie McCulloch of the ASCL union said: ""We think it is extremely unlikely that there will be secondary schools able to welcome back all of their pupils on March 8. ""Testing all secondary school pupils three times on site is a huge logistical challenge. Without significant extra support some schools and colleges may need longer than a week to enable all students to be tested prior to returning to the classroom."" Head teacher Glenn Potts, who runs a 1500-pupil secondary in Oldham, warned: ""To turn round and say we're going to have a fully operating, traditional education system at the same time as doing testing is going to be really challenging for us. ""We're allowed to stagger that return but parents want that confidence that once they're back, they're back for good."" What is your view? Have your say in the comments section Many heads are urging parents to help administer Covid tests for millions of pupils amid concerns that most schools will struggle to cope. Suggestions last year that the millitary could be brought in to help run mobile testing labs have not been followed through. Department for Education officials said that 3.4 million tests have been carried out in schools since the start of January. They claimed that the testing regime was ""robust"" with 97% of schools having sites ready to go. But numbers will have to ramp up significantly. Secondaries have been asked to conduct lateral flow tests for all pupils three times, plus one test at home, in addition to staff. They can return to class once they have a negative test. But they will then be asked to do rapid Covid tests at home twice a week. Students have already missed out on more than two months face-to-face learning - and in many cases even more due to disruption during the autumn term. Ministers are under pressure to allow teachers to continue remote learning in the run up to the Easter break to make sure their education is not further disrupted. The Government has announced another £700m ""catch-up"" funding package for extra secondary tuition. Mr Williamson said that longer school days were not part of the plan. But at a No 10 briefing he confirmed that summer schools would be offered to some children - with classes and wellbeing sessions. Earlier, the minister said government was looking at ""the whole expanse"" of options to help left-behind children. This could include shortening the school summer break. The policy for all secondary pupils to wear masks in the classroom will be reviewed over Easter - but ministers have not ruled out it being in place until June 21. Deputy CMO Dr Jenny Harries admitted it is ""very likely"" the new school testing regime will lead to the discovery of new cases. But officials hope the system will make schools and colleges Covid-free and possibly lead to a rethink on the wearing of face coverings. She also hinted that they won't need to be worn by the general population over the summer. ""One of the things we know, of course, is doing things outside is ever so much safer than doing things inside,"" she said. ""As we get into the autumn, when winter comes in and we spend more time inside, then again we may be looking at it. ""But it's quite possible over summer months, as we did last year when we see rates drop, that we would not need to be wearing masks all that time."" Dr Harries said children should continue to socially distance from grandparents until scientists are ""absolutely sure"" their jabs had worked.",Real Mirror,868.0
539,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson has invoked the teaching of Jesus Christ to urge the public to get a Covid booster jab, in a message issued to mark a Christmas he said would be ""significantly better"" than last year's. In a video statement filmed in front of a Christmas tree in Downing Street, the prime minister celebrated members of the public who were ""getting jabbed not just for themselves, for ourselves, but for friends and family and everyone we meet"".  ""That, after all, is the teaching of Jesus Christ, whose birth is at the heart of this enormous festival – that we should love our neighbours as we love ourselves,"" he said. His words echoed the message from the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who said earlier this week: ""I would say, go and get boosted, get vaccinated. It's how we love our neighbour. Loving our neighbour is what Jesus told us to do. It's Christmas, do what he said."" The prime minister said he could not say the pandemic was over, but pointed out that many people were able to celebrate with more family members this year than last. ""If this year you need a bigger turkey and there are more sprouts to peel and more washing up to do, then that is all to the good, because these rituals matter so deeply. And I hope that people will enjoy this Christmas this year all the more keenly because of what we had to miss last year,"" he said. There had been fears the government might impose limits on socialising over the festive period in a bid to slow the spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant, but ministers decided to wait and monitor the data. In 2020, some parts of the country, including London, the home counties and the east of England, were placed under tier 4 restrictions just days before Christmas that meant a ""stay at home"" order was in place. Elsewhere, up to three households could gather, but only for a single day. The NHS has accelerated the pace of booster vaccinations significantly since the arrival of Omicron, and in some parts of the country will continue to deliver jabs even on Christmas Day. Johnson was baptised a Catholic but has rarely discussed his own religion. He married his wife, Carrie, at the Catholic Westminster Cathedral earlier this year. When ITV's Robert Peston asked if he was a practising Catholic, Johnson replied: ""I don't discuss these deep issues."" The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, used his Christmas message to mark the contribution of frontline workers, including soldiers and nurses, during what he called an ""incredibly difficult"" year. ""For too many, there will be one less chair at the table for the Christmas meal. But, in the darkest of times, Christian values of kindness, of compassion and hope have shone through. Communities have come together to help one another,"" he said. Looking forward to 2022, Starmer said: ""If we stick together, support each other and work together, we can find a path through. I know a better future is possible.""",Real Guardian,510.0
540,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson entered the fraught festive period with his authority in tatters after a string of self-inflicted crises, and with colleagues warning that cancelling Christmas could be the final straw for the exasperated British public. So early, tentative evidence that the Omicron variant may result in less severe health outcomes is the best Christmas present the prime minister could have hoped for.  Downing Street sources expressed caution about over-interpreting the data, with experts continuing to warn that the sheer size of the Omicron wave could still put severe pressure on the NHS, even if a smaller proportion of those infected end up in hospital. But there is now hope that at the very least, the decision on whether to impose strict new restrictions after Christmas may not be cut and dried. The devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have each announced a package of new rules from Boxing Day, ranging from limits on the largest outdoor events to the return of social distancing. Johnson was under pressure from Labour and the Liberal Democrats to give families and businesses in England similar clarity by setting out his plans for the post-Christmas period. But ministers have said they do not yet have the data to act, and the cabinet has not been reconvened since a lengthy, inconclusive meeting on Monday. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, has confirmed there will be no further announcements from the government this week. This wait-and-see approach received the endorsement of the former Labour prime minister Tony Blair, who told Times Radio on Wednesday that he would not have introduced restrictions over Christmas. Blair argued that from a purely public health perspective the case for curbs was strong, but Omicron was so transmissible that only a full lockdown would be likely to have much effect, and this was too much of a ""blunt instrument"" to apply across the board to different categories of people, including the triple-jabbed. Johnson will now be hoping hospitalisations and other data provide a sufficient glimmer of hope to avoid a new year circuit breaker or other measures, such as limits on mixing. Having promised MPs the opportunity to vote on any restrictions, he would only be likely to get them through with the backing of Labour. That would delight the new shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, whose tactic has been to offer staunch support for government measures while highlighting the Tories' divisions. Even if the data falls the right way and Johnson is able to avoid imposing fresh restrictions in the new year, however, Tory backbenchers appear unlikely to credit him for standing firm. Instead, the lockdown sceptics believe the prime minister was left with little room for manoeuvre after the historic rebellion against his plan B measures last week, which strengthened the arm of sceptical cabinet ministers. At the height of the Covid crisis in 2020 there was little cabinet consultation, with key decisions on draconian lockdown measures being made by an inner circle of Johnson, senior ministers and close advisers, while the full cabinet acted as little more than a rubber stamp. But Johnson's power over his party is now considerably less secure, so that – as during Theresa May's troubled premiership – the content of cabinet meetings is readily leaked, with jockeying rivals briefing their contributions to the press. Johnson will be sincerely relieved if England can start the new year free of harsh restrictions that could further batter his popularity, and he may even hope that, as with last year's vaccine bounce, the end of the Omicron wave boosts the public mood. And it will certainly save him a fresh confrontation with battle-hardened backbenchers. But the pressure from within Johnson's party over everything from political mismanagement to lockdown-busting parties, and from MPs looking at the North Shropshire result and fearing for their own future, is unlikely to abate.",Real Guardian,642.0
541,Real,The Guardian,"Wales and Northern Ireland have announced stringent restrictions that will come into force from Boxing Day, including the return of the rule of six for hospitality venues, in an effort to curb the spread of the Omicron variant. The first minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, accused Boris Johnson of being in a ""state of paralysis,"" over Omicron as he set out a package of strict measures he said would put his country at ""alert level two"".  These include reintroducing the 2-metre social distancing rule in pubs, cinemas and theatres, banning all large events and insisting on table service only in hospitality venues. ""Omicron is here already in Wales and it is now spreading quickly,"" Drakeford said. ""We are now entering a really serious phase of the pandemic. Wales will reopen after Christmas, but in order to do so safely we have to do everything we can in order to go on protecting ourselves and taking care of others."" The government in Northern Ireland announced a similar package from Boxing Day, including the return of the rule of six for hospitality venues and table service only. Nightclubs will have to close, but mass sports events will be allowed to go ahead. Members of the public will also be advised not to mix in groups of more than three households. Ministers decided on the measures after a cabinet meeting that lasted four hours. The deputy first minister, Michelle O'Neill, said: ""The approach we've taken today is both reasonable and proportionate, given what we know today."" The health minister, Robin Swann, said more measures might be necessary in the coming days. Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, also announced new Covid curbs to come into force after Christmas on Tuesday, including limits on mass events, leaving England an apparent outlier. Dr David Wrigley, the deputy chair of the British Medical Association, which represents about 150,000 doctors, said: ""Ten days ago we called for increased protective measures including limits to social mixing, cancellation of large scale social gatherings and reduction of contact between households. ""Now that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have started making post-Christmas plans along these lines, it's imperative for England to do the same this week."" Johnson has said fresh restrictions may need to come into force after Christmas, but has not detailed what they might be or when they would be confirmed. Drakeford said: ""They are paralysed by their internal divisions … When we see the evidence and we're told about the actions we can take to protect people, we will take them. I think there's a real contrast with the paralysis of a UK government simply unable to act."" Drakeford said the Welsh government had decided not to impose legal regulations on social mixing at home or in outdoor public places such as parks or gardens, as in earlier phases of the pandemic. He said such measures were unnecessary given that so many people were now vaccinated and lateral flow tests were widely available. He did, however, issue what he said was ""strong guidance"" about mixing at home, including limiting the number of people visiting, meeting outdoors where possible and ensuring good ventilation. He also said £120m would be available for nightclubs, retail, hospitality, leisure and tourism businesses affected by the move to alert level two, double the £60m package announced last week. ""We are facing a very serious situation in Wales. A wave of infections caused by the new, fast-moving and very infectious Omicron variant is headed our way,"" he said. ""This new form of coronavirus could infect large numbers of people in Wales, disrupting daily lives and businesses, and could cause an increase in the number of people who need hospital care in the coming weeks."" The measures are likely to intensify calls for more generous financial support for firms already suffering from a dramatic reduction in business as the public cut back on socialising in the run-up to Christmas. The Night Time Industries Association described the Welsh announcement as a devastating blow. ""We urge UK government to immediately reimplement furlough and provide further proportionate support to the devolved nations so that businesses across the UK can survive what is now looking like the toughest point of the pandemic to date,"" it said in a statement.",Real Guardian,709.0
542,Real,The Guardian,"Daily cases of Covid-19 have passed 100,000 as the Omicron variant sweeps across the UK, according to government figures – the highest number recorded since the pandemic began. More than 106,122 new infections were reported in the 24 hours to 9am on Wednesday, up from 90,629 on Tuesday, dashing hopes that cases could be beginning to plateau. The unprecedented figure will only intensify concerns about the likely impact of the Omicron variant on hospitalisations in the new year.  The government has also provided a second metric showing the number of positive cases for the day the specimen was taken, which peaked at 103,281 on 15 December. Confirmed cases of Omicron in England have risen by 13,106 to 69,147, the UK Health Security Agency said. Scotland's cases rose by 174 to 1,652, while in Wales they increased by 301 to 941. There were no updated numbers available for Northern Ireland because of data flow complications. The prime minister has announced that no new restrictions will be put in place for England before Christmas – but made clear fresh measures might be required afterwards. Wales and Scotland have already set out new curbs to come into force after Christmas, with Cardiff reimposing the rule of six and 2-metre social distancing in hospitality venues from Boxing Day. Stormont ministers have agreed that nightclubs in Northern Ireland will close from Boxing Day. The move was agreed at a virtual meeting of the power-sharing executive on Wednesday and came as the region recorded its highest daily increase in case numbers of the virus. As well as case numbers, ministers are monitoring hospital admissions, particularly in London, where the Omicron wave is most advanced. NHS England has said that a total of 301 Covid-19 admissions were recorded by hospitals in London on 20 December, up 78% week on week and the highest number for a single day since 7 February. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, rejected reports on Wednesday that ministers had already been shown data suggesting Omicron produces less severe health outcomes than the previous Delta variant. He said the analysis by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) was not yet complete. With fears growing about mass staff absences across key sectors in January, Javid has also announced that mandatory self-isolation for those suffering from Covid-19 will be reduced from 10 days to seven, as long as patients take two negative lateral flow tests on days six and seven of their spell at home. Those leaving self-isolation early are still strongly advised to minimise contact with others in crowded or poorly ventilated spaces. Boris Johnson's cabinet held a lengthy meeting earlier on Tuesday at which it was briefed by scientific experts, but opted not to impose any new restrictions immediately. The cabinet is divided, with some ministers, including Liz Truss and Jacob Rees-Mogg, more sceptical about the need for controls, while Javid has been warning against waiting too long for more data to become available.",Real Guardian,491.0
543,Real,The Guardian,"Even before David Frost's departure from the government this weekend, Boris Johnson's authority had for weeks been relentlessly battered by unforced errors and scandal. However, the resignation of the man regarded by Tory rightwingers as the guarantor of a ""clean Brexit"" is a devastating blow for the prime minister's authority – as well as depriving him of a trusted friend and adviser.  Lord Frost's allies insist that his resignation has nothing to do with Brexit, and instead relates to Johnson's domestic policy agenda, including the 1.5 percentage point increase in national insurance contributions coming in April, and the commitment to achieving net zero emissions. ""He's very disillusioned with the policy direction of the government at the moment,"" said one source close to Frost. ""It's the No 10, high-tax, high-spend economic philosophy."" Nevertheless, hardline Brexiters, many of whom were already in open revolt over Covid restrictions, now fear that without Frost around the cabinet table, No 10 may force through a deal with Brussels over the Northern Ireland protocol that they would regard as an unacceptable capitulation. Handing Frost's portfolio to Liz Truss, alongside her wider responsibilities as foreign secretary, is viewed with trepidation among this group, because while they admire her free-market principles, they regard the Foreign Office as deeply suspect on all things Brexit. Meanwhile, Frost's complaints about Johnson's tax-and-spend approach crystallised some MPs' mounting concerns about the direction of travel in Downing Street – as well as chiming with the views of potential leadership contenders Truss and Rishi Sunak. Sunak has let it be known that he would not have gone ahead with the national insurance increase without Johnson's urging, and Truss is known to have been sceptical about the ""plan B"" Covid measures that prompted last week's Tory revolt. One senior Tory MP suggested Johnson may have deliberately given Truss the knotty job of resolving the impasse over Northern Ireland as a means of undermining her, joking: ""Bang go her leadership prospects."" Backbenchers' fury about Frost's resignation burst into the open in a furious WhatsApp exchange leaked to Sky News on Saturday evening. The MP Marcus Fysh described Frost as a ""hero"" who was ""100% right"", while his outspoken colleague Andrew Bridgen claimed that ""most"" Tory backbenchers shared Frost's concerns about government policy. When the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, stepped in to defend the prime minister, in a WhatsApp group called Clean Global Brexit, the MP Steve Baker responded by removing her from the group, saying, ""Enough is enough."" Despite the febrile mood, a leadership challenge to Johnson appears unlikely while the country is in the grip of the Omicron crisis. While some MPs have already put in their letters to Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the backbench 1922 Committee, to demand a vote of no confidence, few believe the number is currently anywhere near the 54 required. More than half of Johnson's MPs – a minimum of 181 – would have to vote against him for a leadership race to be triggered (in which Johnson could not then take part). While the prime minister may be safe in the immediate term, however, he must now navigate through an intensely difficult period. The Whitehall ethics guru Sue Gray is investigating lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street; ministers must decide whether to defy Tory rebels and impose Covid restrictions before Christmas; and the local elections in May appear highly likely to provide voters with another opportunity to kick the government, after last week's extraordinary byelection result in North Shropshire. Any or all of these events could lead to a handful more letters (or emails) of no confidence being penned, while any potential leadership contender who felt they had a secure head start could urge their followers to submit more en masse. Meanwhile, Johnson is described by Downing Street insiders as disconsolate and isolated – and his performance in a post-byelection interview on Friday appeared to suggest his only response to partygate is to attempt to change the subject. One senior Tory described Frost's departure as ""devastating"". ""The two men who basically set his ideological and policy position, on Brexit and certainly on the domestic issues, were David Frost and Dominic Cummings. And now he's lost them both, it's a bit like the Wizard of Oz,"" they said. ""Now the people who were actually doing a lot of the behind the scenes work for him have gone, and you look behind the curtain, and it's not what we thought. And I think the Tory party's increasingly come round to that Wizard of Oz view of Boris.""",Real Guardian,758.0
544,Real,The Guardian,"The health secretary, Sajid Javid, has made clear that tougher Covid restrictions could be imposed in England before Christmas, after the government's Sage committee warned that hospitalisations could peak at between 3,000 and 10,000 a day unless action is taken. Javid acknowledged that data about the Omicron variant remained incomplete – but suggested it might be necessary to make decisions before a full picture is available.  Asked to rule out new measures pre-Christmas, he said: ""We are assessing the situation; it's very fast-moving,"" adding, ""there's a lot of uncertainty, there are gaps in the data, but we must work with the data we've got, we mustn't let perfection be the enemy of the good."" Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Javid stressed that it was already clear that Omicron spread very quickly, adding that there were likely to be many more cases than official data is showing. In minutes published this weekend, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) urged the government to reintroduce ""more stringent measures … very soon"", warning that cases were set to reach between 600,000 and 2m a day by the end of the month if action was not taken immediately. Pressed about Sage's advice, Javid said: ""It's a very sobering analysis, we take it very seriously."" He said he and his colleagues would be assessing the advice, alongside the wider effect of potential measures, including their economic effects. Echoing the message of England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, earlier this week, Javid also called on the public to be careful about socialising in the run-up to Christmas. ""It's time to be more cautious. We know this thing is spreading rapidly,"" he said. Javid said he would be taking a lateral flow test before seeing his elderly mother, and would hug her less than usual. Cabinet ministers are understood to have discussed the possibility of fresh restrictions in a call on Saturday, with the prime minister keen to hold out until after Christmas. Pressure on the government over Covid curbs has been intensified by the shock resignation on Saturday night of the Brexit minister, David Frost, who made clear that his objection to the ""plan B"" measures put in place last week was one of the reasons for his departure. The changes, which included widening mandatory mask-wearing and requiring Covid passes at large venues, were passed only with Labour support, with 100 Conservative backbenchers rebelling against the changes. Boris Johnson has promised to recall parliament if he judges that tougher regulations are needed over Christmas – though he could issue non-binding guidance to the public without doing so. The shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, told Trevor Phillips on Sunday on Sky News that Javid was ""a hostage to his own party"" on Covid. ""The prime minister has a big problem when it comes to the crisis of confidence in his leadership in his own ranks, and crucially that is impacting on the government's public health response,"" he said. Streeting said that if parliament was recalled in the coming days, Labour was ready to support more restrictions if these were recommended by scientists. ""He doesn't have to negotiate with the people holding him to ransom on his own backbenches, because we will act in the public interest, we will put public health before party politics,"" he said. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, who declared Omicron a ""major incident"" in the capital on Saturday, argued that further controls on mixing should be introduced. ""If we don't bring in new restrictions sooner rather than later, you're going to see even more positive cases, and potentially public services like the NHS on the verge of collapse, if not collapsing."" He suggested the right moment to move might be after Christmas, given the importance for people's mental health of meeting up with their families.",Real Guardian,636.0
545,Real,The Guardian,"Hobnobbing with tech bosses in California as the hospitality sector howled in pain at the catastrophic impact of the Omicron variant was a rare political misstep for a chancellor whose public image is so carefully polished. Until midweek, the Treasury had stuck carefully to the line that ample financial support was already available to hard-hit hospitality firms – the VAT cut for the sector extends into next spring, for example.  And Downing Street officials maintained that since they weren't ordering businesses to close, additional help would not be necessary. Sunak himself was said to be deeply sceptical about turning the bailout taps back on, after the furlough scheme was finally wound down in the autumn, and as he tries to rebuild his reputation for fiscal prudence – something he believes is a key dividing line with Labour. Yet even before Chris Whitty advised the public ""don't mix with people you don't have to"", restaurants and pubs were sounding the alarm about plunging takings in the crucial Christmas season – one they hoped would mark a return to something like normal after last year's festive shutdown. And added to the public's growing caution as they batten down the hatches is the impact of mass absences as Omicron rips through the population – particularly in London, though other areas are unlikely to be far behind. By Wednesday, when Whitty and the prime minister were peppered with questions about what precautions the public should take, it was clear the line wouldn't hold – and on Thursday morning a string of Conservative MPs vented their frustration at the lack of support (as well as at Whitty, the chief medical officer for England). Sunak prepared to fly back to London, first delivering the soothing message that he was listening to hospitality businesses, and would continue to work with them ""over the coming days"". With venues closing and a slew of events and performances being cancelled, the consensus at Westminster is that the chancellor may have to move faster than that, and announce a package of support before the weekend. He now faces the dilemma of whether to draw up a relatively small-scale, targeted rescue scheme just for hospitality – or address the crisis many more businesses are likely to face over the next month or so, as staff fall ill. Sunak is widely seen as a potential successor to Boris Johnson, whose authority has taken a hammering in recent weeks over a series of missteps and scandals. Being caught on the hop in his spiritual home of sunny California underlined how different his style is to that of Johnson. Sunak is an enthusiast for the entrepreneurial west coast startup culture, devoting part of his Tory party conference speech this year to the potential for artificial intelligence (as well as promising to make the UK ""the most exciting place on the planet""). He met his wealthy wife, Akshata Murty, when the pair were studying at Stanford, and the couple have a property in California. One Labour strategist dismissively calls him a ""wannabe tech bro"", with his branded hoodies and Palm Angel sliders. Sunak and the prime minister have distinct ideological differences too. While Johnson's instinct is to spend his way out of a political hole, Sunak wants to build up enough headroom now to cut taxes in the run-up to the next general election. There has sometimes been frustration in the Treasury about Johnson's boosterish tendency to overpromise. But for now, Sunak will be reluctantly forced back into spending mode, to prop up an economy battered yet again by Covid. And he will be hoping voters – as well as furious backbenchers – will forget that he was caught on the wrong side of the Atlantic when the crisis hit.",Real Guardian,625.0
546,Real,The Guardian,"Downing Street has slapped down a Conservative MP who warned against the UK becoming a ""public health socialist state"", after Chris Whitty suggested people cut down on pre-Christmas socialising. Speaking at a Downing Street press conference on Wednesday alongside the prime minister, England's chief medical officer urged the public: ""Don't mix with people you don't have to.""  The comments intensified calls from the hospitality sector for financial aid to help them cope with plunging bookings. Joy Morrissey, the MP for Beaconsfield and a parliamentary aide to the justice secretary, Dominic Raab, tweeted on Friday morning: ""Perhaps the covid unelected public health spokesperson should defer to what our ELECTED members of parliament and the prime minister have decided."" She added: ""I know it's difficult to remember but this is not how democracy works. This is not a public health socialist state."" Boris Johnson's official spokesperson said the prime minister did not agree with the view expressed by Morrissey. ""Professor Whitty is a hugely respected and trusted public servant, who provides independent, evidence-based advice,"" he said. Morrissey replaced Dominic Grieve as Beaconsfield MP after the former attorney general was thrown out of the Conservative party for trying to block a no-deal Brexit. She took down the tweet after less than half an hour but subsequently posted a more moderate version of the same message, saying she was ""increasingly concerned"" about ""public health pronouncements made in the media"". Labour called for Morrissey to apologise or be sacked from her role as Raab's parliamentary private secretary. In a letter to Raab, the shadow justice secretary, Steve Reed, said: ""It is vital, especially during this pandemic, that our leading scientists have the freedom to give public health advice to the public and to offer their expertise without fear of reprisal. As the Omicron variant spreads rapidly through Britain, there must not be any sign of the government censoring or intimidating our leading scientific experts."" Several other Conservative MPs have also reacted with anger to Whitty's comments, which intensified calls from the hospitality sector for financial aid to help them cope with plunging bookings. Johnson suffered his largest ever rebellion over Covid restrictions on Tuesday, with 100 Conservative MPs voting against the government's plans for Covid passes. In the House of Commons on Thursday, Steve Baker asked the Treasury minister John Glen: ""What reassurance can he give me that when officials speak, particularly on podiums at press conferences, that they are staying within the bounds of the policy that ministers have decided?"" During the same debate, over financial support for businesses hit by the Omicron wave, the former public health minister Steve Brine said: ""At a stroke the chief medical officer changed government policy and put this country, certainly hospitality, into effective lockdown."" He claimed: ""Advisers are now running the show."" Downing Street played down differences between Whitty and the prime minister's stance, however. Johnson's spokesperson said: ""Both the prime minister and the [chief medical officer] were making the point that given the current infection rate, the prevalence of the variant, people should be cautious.""",Real Guardian,510.0
547,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson has warned his cabinet that ""a huge spike of Omicron is coming"" as the government braces itself for a significant backbench rebellion over Covid restrictions in England. The cabinet met virtually on Tuesday before four Commons votes on ""plan B"" measures, including wider mandatory mask wearing and a requirement to show a Covid certificate or negative test result at large venues.  MPs will also vote on whether healthcare workers should have to prove they have been vaccinated in order to remain in their posts. All four measures are expected to pass, but the government is likely to have to rely heavily on Labour support. According to an official readout of the cabinet meeting, the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, warned ministers to expect a ""significant increase"" in hospitalisations, with cases doubling every two to three days. Whitty said it was too early to say whether cases in South Africa may have plateaued or peaked, as some reports have suggested, and there was not yet reliable evidence about the severity of the variant. Johnson told his ministers there would be a ""huge spike"" in cases, with the UK Health Security Agency suggesting there may have been as many as 200,000 Omicron cases on Monday alone. The government is working with Royal Mail to free up more delivery slots to keep up with public demand for lateral flow tests. While the plan B measures have infuriated some Tory backbenchers, with as many as 70 expected to abstain or vote against the government, some experts believe tougher curbs, such as hospitality closures, may yet be necessary. Asked whether ministers could take more stringent measures, the prime minister's official spokesperson said: ""We need to learn more about this variant, on things like severity, before we decide what, if any, action is required in the future."" The prime minister and the health secretary have been ringing round potential Tory rebels in an attempt to minimise the scale of the revolt in Tuesday's votes. Conservative backbenchers have been particularly exercised about the new requirement to show a ""vaccine passport"" to enter large venues such as nightclubs. The government has changed the proposal to include the ability to show a negative lateral flow test, in an attempt to placate potential rebels. One parliamentary private secretary who had been deemed at risk of resigning rather than support the measures said on Tuesday he had been won over. Danny Kruger said he had been reassured by Johnson and Javid that the measures would mean that ""there will never be compulsory vaccination for any citizen, or vaccination as a condition of employment for anyone except health and care workers, and that there will never be vaccine passports, as opposed to the 'Covid passports' that include a lateral flow test"".",Real Guardian,464.0
548,Real,The Guardian,"It was one of the most eye-catching moves in Keir Starmer's shadow cabinet reshuffle, marking a comeback for a former cabinet minister who first cut her teeth in government under Tony Blair. And Yvette Cooper has wasted little time putting herself at the forefront of her party's pitch to win the next general election.  In an interview with the Guardian, the new shadow home secretary said Labour now had a top team that ""could be in government tomorrow"", and could credibly challenge the Tories on law and order. Asked about her new role, Cooper said: ""The thing that feels important about it is, I've had now 11 years of working in detail on Home Office issues, as well as obviously, past experience in government as the courts minister, and cabinet experience as well. And Keir was obviously five years as the director of public prosecutions. So I think together, we bring very strong experience and a Labour alternative."" Asked whether the reshuffle marked a shift to the political right, she said ""it's a focus on a shadow cabinet that could be in government tomorrow"", contrasting that with a government she called ""shambolic, and not really capable of doing the job"". Cooper was shadow home secretary during Ed Miliband's leadership, before returning to the backbenches as chair of the home affairs select committee for the past five years. Speaking for the first time since her appointment, Cooper attacked Boris Johnson for undermining the rule of law; demanded more action on ""spiking""; and underscored Labour's calls for predeparture testing to slow the spread of the Omicron variant. With the prime minister under pressure over a Downing Street Christmas party apparently held last December while strict limits on socialising were in place, Cooper said Johnson's scant regard for rules meant the Tories' claim to be the party of law an order was a ""joke"". ""He still really thinks it's one rule for him and another for everyone else,"" she said. ""They have undermined all of the institutions that hold up the criminal justice system, from policing, to prevention, to the courts, and they have stepped back and done nothing while it's frankly become much easier to be a criminal. But also, they actually just show no respect for following the rules."" She contrasted that with what she called Starmer's ""serious steadiness"". Cooper said Labour was the party of ""safer communities"" and would take a more active approach than the Tories in tackling crime at its roots, citing as an example the spiking of drinks. ""I just think it should be treated as a serious crime: it's not being. And actually, it's poisoning people,"" she said. ""How have we allowed a situation to arise, where young people go to clubs or to pubs and have to protect their drinks? ""An active Home Office would say: OK we've got evidence that there's a problem that seems to be getting worse. Is it linked to something that's happening online? Is it linked to changing crime patterns? Is there work that local authorities can do working with police forces? ""The Tories don't do any of that, because they don't think it's their responsibility. We believe in active government, to do something about it."" Cooper said she would back the government on some issues, such as countering terrorist threats, but in other areas Labour would be ""calling on them to get a grip, but also setting out: actually here's what grip would look like."" On immigration, where the Tories have consistently sough to portray Labour as soft, Cooper says she believes the public are ready for a ""calm, sensible conversation"". ""What does a fair immigration system look like, that supports the economy, that allows people to fall in love across borders, to get married?"" she said. Labour is not backing the government's nationality and borders bill, which returns to parliament next week and includes measures Johnson has claimed will allow the Border Force to turn back people trying to reach England in small boats. Rather than criticise the bill as illiberal, Cooper said: ""This legislation is just a sham, and they're making a lot of promises, but actually all they've got is unworkable measures.""

Cooper echoes the approach of her predecessor Nick Thomas-Symonds by calling for the government to negotiate a post-Brexit successor to the Dublin agreement, which allows some asylum seekers to be returned to the first EU country in which they arrived, to help tackle the challenge of preventing so many people risking their lives by taking to the sea in flimsy vessels. ""That included family reunion, that included safe legal routes, and it included safe returns as well,"" she said. She points out that the government has returned just five asylum seekers in the past nine months, despite its tough rhetoric, compared with 289 last year when the UK was still bound by the Dublin agreement.",Real Guardian,850.0
549,Real,The Guardian,"Experts advising the government called last week for ""early and robust actions"" to limit the transmission of the Omicron Covid variant, minutes reveal. Members of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) held an extraordinary meeting last Thursday and agreed they could not rule out the new variant causing a larger wave of infections that could potentially overwhelm the NHS.  The scientists noted that firm data was not yet available but early analysis of the variant provided ""sufficiently worrying signals"" for them to recommend ""early and robust actions to prevent introduction and onward transmission"". First detected in South Africa and named Omicron by the World Health Organization (WHO), the emergence of the B.1.1.529 variant has prompted the government to reintroduce mandatory mask-wearing in shops and on public transport and dramatically increase the pace of the booster programme. Ministers have also introduced more stringent self-isolation policies for those in contact with positive Omicron cases, and placed South Africa and a string of other countries on the travel red list. But the government has resisted further changes, such as advising the public to work from home, and Boris Johnson on Tuesday rejected the advice of Jenny Harries, the chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), who said the public should cut down on unnecessary socialising. The prime minister said at a Downing Street press conference: ""We don't want people to cancel such events."" The minutes of the Nervtag meeting, published on Wednesday, stressed that it remained unclear how serious the health outcomes of the variant could be, but that a large wave of infections could potentially overwhelm the NHS. ""Although data on disease severity associated with B.1.1.529 are not yet available, a large wave of infections will be accompanied by a wave of severe cases and the subgroup cannot rule out that this may be sufficient to overwhelm NHS capacity,"" the minutes say. With the tighter mask rules due to be reviewed in three weeks, Downing Street has suggested NHS capacity will be the key determinant of whether more action will be needed. Separately, leaked minutes from a meeting of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), to which Nervtag reports, suggested experts had called on the government to introduce predeparture testing for travellers returning to the UK. The BBC reported that minutes of a meeting held on Monday reveal scientists saying such testing – which Labour has called for – could be valuable. The new shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said: ""It is totally unacceptable that ministers are failing to take action at the border when even their own advisers are telling them to introduce predeparture tests. ""It cannot be right that people can travel to an airport, board a busy flight, queue at busy departure gates, and travel on trains and buses in the UK, all without having taken a test."" Nervtag was not specific about which measures the government should take. It did call for the vaccine programme to be stepped up – advice the government has heeded, with Johnson announcing at a press conference on Monday that all eligible adults would be offered a third dose of vaccine by the end of January. Since the variant was detected, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has advised that all adults should receive a booster vaccination, a recommendation that the government has accepted.",Real Guardian,561.0
550,Real,The Guardian,"Every eligible adult in the UK should be offered a Covid booster by the end of January as ministers race to increase protection against the Omicron variant, Boris Johnson has announced. ""We're going to be throwing everything at it, to ensure everyone eligible is offered a booster in just over two months,"" the prime minister said, adding that he would be getting his own third vaccine on Thursday.  He said the government's aim was for the pace of the rollout to match that seen for earlier courses of the vaccine. ""There will be temporary vaccine centres popping up like Christmas trees,"" he said. As before, age groups will be invited one at a time, eldest to youngest, to receive their booster. ""We'll move down the cohorts rapidly,"" Johnson said. The prime minister was speaking at a Downing Street press conference alongside the health secretary, Sajid Javid, and the chief executive of NHS England, Amanda Pritchard. Shortly before the briefing began, the UK Health Security Agency announced that a further eight cases of the Omicron variant had been discovered in England, bringing the UK total to 22. The prime minister urged the public not to be gloomy about news of the emergence of the new variant, insisting the country was in a much better position with vaccines available. ""Right now, our best single defence against Omicron is to get vaccinated and to get boosted,"" the prime minister said. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommended on Monday that all over-18s be offered a third jab, and the gap between the second and third doses be halved to three months. Javid said: ""We're now able to put our booster programme on steroids, and protect even more people, even more quickly … If we want to give ourselves the chance of a Christmas with our loved ones, the best thing we can do is step up, roll up our sleeves, and get protected when the time comes."" Pritchard said for the time being only those already eligible for a booster, which includes over-40s whose second jab was six months ago, would be able to book an appointment, and it would later be opened more widely. She urged people to wait until they are contacted by the NHS before trying to book. Pritchard said the NHS now has almost 3,000 vaccination sites available across the UK. But she stressed that while the NHS was confident it could meet the end-January target for offering all adults a booster, she warned ""it can't happen overnight"", pointing to the pressures on health service staff.",Real Guardian,430.0
551,Real,The Guardian,"""Reshuffle"" seemed an understatement, given the radical scope of the shake-up Keir Starmer carried out among Labour's top ranks on Monday, with few posts left untouched. Starmer's aides saw it as completing the work begun in May's botched overhaul, which saw Anneliese Dodds replaced by Rachel Reeves as shadow chancellor; but was derailed by Angela Rayner, who resisted a move for herself.  Changes for both Jon Ashworth and Lisa Nandy were mooted at the time, and have now been acted on. And this time around, Starmer publicly asserted his authority over Rayner – with whom relations have continued to be scratchy – by kicking off the reshuffle as she was delivering a major speech in Westminster on cleaning up public life. She was briefly informed that a shake-up was under way; but not consulted (though Jeremy Corbyn certainly didn't consult his deputy, Tom Watson, on the makeup of his shadow team either). The end result marked a shift to the political right, and created a powerful platform for rising stars Wes Streeting and Bridget Phillipson, both viewed as effective media performers. Shadow cabinet ministers had recently complained about how much airtime Streeting was getting, despite holding the relatively junior post of shadow schools minister. As shadow health secretary in the midst of a pandemic, he will now be a key spokesperson and public face of a potential future Labour government. One Labour insider suggested there had been little effort to match people to their expertise – citing Steve Reed's move to shadow justice, for example – and an overwhelming focus on who can deliver a punchy media performance. More low-key shadow ministers, including Kate Green at education and Luke Pollard at environment, both of whom were viewed by colleagues as diligent and thoughtful, were unceremoniously ditched. Tellingly, one Starmer aide told the Politico newsletter – a daily note for Westminster insiders – that the reshuffle had put, ""fresh hungry effective message-carriers in key briefs"". His team are ruthlessly pursuing the aim of winning over swing voters in a handful of key seats, many of them in the ""red wall"", and want people in place who are reassuring to Conservative-Labour switchers, not redolent of Corbyn. They believe they are succeeding for the first time in a long time in having a leader voters can imagine as prime minister; and are delighted by the performance of Reeves, including, recently, a highly positive profile in the Telegraph; but they now want to build on that by creating a wider team the public can imagine as a government. To that end, the overhaul also saw the return of Labour ""big beast"" Yvette Cooper, one of a relatively small number of sitting MPs – with Ed Miliband and Hilary Benn – who have been cabinet ministers. Starmer appeared to avoid such tall poppies in his first frontbench team, instead promoting Nick Thomas-Symonds and Dodds, both intellectuals with deep expertise, but without their own powerbases in the party. One longtime Labour insider remarked that both Cooper and Miliband are ""more experienced politicians than Keir,"" suggesting that by moving Miliband sideways and bringing Cooper into the tent, he must now feel his own position is more secure. So for Starmer's team, the reshuffle was an assertion of his authority, which had been battered by the ham-fisted reshuffle back in May; and a signal of intent to voters, with a general election potentially just a couple of years away. For MPs on Labour's soft left, who had previously regarded Starmer as one of their own, the end result was a sense of gnawing disquiet about a continued drift to the right, however. And some warned that the relentless focus on target voters in the red wall, while understandable given the shape of 2019's crushing defeat, risked alienating other groups Labour may need if it is ultimately to succeed in forming the next government.",Real Guardian,646.0
552,Real,The Guardian,"Yvette Cooper – shadow home secretary  Cooper is making a return to the brief she held under Ed Miliband, when she faced then-home secretary Theresa May across the dispatch box. After a failed tilt at the leadership in 2015, Cooper went to the backbenches under Jeremy Corbyn, later serving as chair of the home affairs select committee. Cooper will now be one of the few former cabinet ministers from the Gordon Brown era on Labour's frontbench, having served as work and pensions secretary from 2008 to 2010. David Lammy – shadow foreign secretary The former shadow justice secretary is one of the most prominent Windrush campaigners, giving a speech in 2018 on the subject that left the Commons in stunned silence. Lammy is one of the few cabinet ministers with experience serving in government: previously holding ministerial roles in the departments of health, culture and education. Wes Streeting – shadow health and social care secretary Perhaps best known for speaking about his upbringing on free school meals, Streeting previously described his move to the shadow cabinet (as shadow minister for child poverty) as ""a proper Labour story"" of social mobility. A fierce critic of the Labour far left, Streeting was one of the most outspoken critics of Corbyn's leadership. Before being elected to represent Ilford North in 2015, he was head of education at Stonewall and is a former president of the National Union of Students. Lucy Powell – shadow digital, culture, media and sport secretary A former chief of staff to Ed Miliband, Powell worked with senior Conservative MPs to try for a Brexit compromise during the last government. She is a former shadow education secretary, and more recently has been in the shadow housing role. Powell was heavily involved in producing the Labour Together report on the 2019 election defeat, much of which was taken on board by Starmer's team. Lisa Nandy – shadow levelling up secretary Known for her long campaign for Labour to focus more on understanding the concerns of voters who live in towns rather than metropolitan cities, Lisa Nandy was one of just three candidates who made it on to the ballot paper during the 2020 leadership election. She came third but was given a senior role as foreign secretary by Starmer straight from the backbenches – her first role in the shadow cabinet since 2016, when she was shadow energy and climate change secretary. Labour insiders regard her as an authentic and effective communicator key to winning back ""red wall"" seats the party lost in the 2019 general election. Jonathan Ashworth – shadow work and pensions secretary One of the few shadow cabinet ministers to keep his job during the change of leadership from Jeremy Corbyn to Starmer, Ashworth was kept on in the health role as the coronavirus pandemic raged through the UK last spring. As MP for Leicester South, he was critical of the city being the only place that faced tougher restrictions despite the rest of England exiting lockdown. He outlasted Matt Hancock – who resigned for breaking social distancing rules – but was told the news about his move while at home self-isolating with Covid. Jonathan Reynolds – shadow business secretary Reynolds had been the shadow work and pensions secretary since April 2020. He served in Corbyn's shadow cabinet but subsequently resigned in 2016 and supported Owen Smith's leadership challenge. However, he was one of those who made it back into the fold, serving again under Corbyn as a shadow city minister. He will now be expected to improve Labour's reputation with business. Ed Miliband – shadow climate change and net zero secretary The former Labour leader spent much of Cop26 in Glasgow delivering broadsides at the government over its failure to tackle the climate crisis. However, some of Miliband's colleagues have long questioned whether he is at home in the business part of his brief – a key challenge at a time when Labour is keen to burnish its credentials with the corporate sector. He has now lost half his brief. Nick Thomas-Symonds – shadow trade secretary A former barrister and Oxford don, 41-year-old Thomas-Symonds is a genuine Labour intellectual – the author of biographies of Clement Attlee and Nye Bevan, as well as a forthcoming one of Harold Wilson. He represents the Welsh seat of Torfaen, where he grew up, and has been trying to reposition Labour as a strong supporter of the police, and tough on crime. He is moving from his role as shadow home secretary. Cat Smith – no longer on Labour frontbench As Cat Smith said in her resignation letter to Keir Starmer, since becoming MP for Lancaster and Fleetwood in 2015 she has spent all but a few months on the frontbenches. An early supporter of Jeremy Corbyn, she became a junior equalities minister under him just four months after entering parliament. Her loyalty to him was clear when she stood down as shadow cabinet Office minister on Monday, saying in a parting message to Starmer that it was ""utterly unsustainable"" Corbyn had not been given the party whip.",Real Guardian,848.0
553,Real,The Guardian,"Michael Gove is chairing a new weekly cabinet committee on levelling up, to bang heads together across Whitehall, as the government battles to repair the political damage of the past three weeks and show it is serious about tackling economic inequalities. After a tumultuous period that culminated in the prime minister's fumbled speech to the CBI on Monday, the forthcoming levelling-up white paper, expected to be published in mid-December, is regarded as a key moment to demonstrate the government's seriousness.  Gove had publicly argued for a new committee structure to ensure levelling up is implemented across government, and has won the backing of the prime minister for that approach. He was given the levelling-up brief in Boris Johnson's September reshuffle in a move widely regarded at the time as underlining the importance placed on it by the prime minister. However, Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, will accuse the government of ""selling out the north"" on Saturday, after the scaling-back of the integrated rail plan and the introduction of the social care cap, which she will call ""a dementia tax on working-class people and a dementia tax on the north"". She will criticise the rail plans, which also disappointed many Conservative MPs. ""The government's rail plan is a betrayal of trust, a betrayal of promises made to our communities and a betrayal of the north,"" she will tell Labour's North West conference. ""Only the Conservatives would call a train line that stops on this side of the Pennines a trans-Pennine rail line. It's like the Eurostar stopping at Dover and then you get on a Pacer train across the Channel."" Government sources rejected reports on Friday that the Treasury had blocked additional funding for levelling up, pointing out that the three-year spending review was only delivered last month, and there had been no additional bid from Gove's department since then. However, there have been tensions between the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and No 10 in recent days, with the Treasury frustrated at a series of botched announcements of major policy decisions. Scores of Conservative backbenchers refused to back detailed plans for the social care cap on Monday amid fears they will disproportionately penalise families with modest assets. The levelling-up white paper is regarded as a potential reset moment for the government. Gove has suggested the aim of the policy is to help young people to ""stay local and go far"", by creating more opportunities outside London and the south-east. It has been drawn up with detailed input from Neil O'Brien, formerly the prime minister's levelling-up adviser and now a minister in Gove's department, and former Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane. It is expected to set out new proposals for devolution, including powerful county mayors, and a shake-up of the boundaries of existing mayoralties. Gove told the levelling-up select committee in a hearing on 8 November: ""Without wanting to pre-empt the white paper in detail, we will be looking at mayoral combined authorities. Should their geography change, ie grow?"" It is understood there are concerns in government that some mayoralties, including those in Bristol and North Tyne, do not match the local economic geography, making them less effective than some other models of devolution. However, government insiders said the policy document would set out a ""framework"" for more devolution, with final details only to be agreed in consultation with local leaders. Other themes are likely to include skills, transport and investment – but not planning, with controversial reforms to the planning system still on ""pause"" as they are reconsidered in the light of the Conservatives' loss of the Chesham and Amersham byelection. Revised proposals are now not expected to be published until the new year, the Guardian understands. Johnson has suggested that levelling up is the central idea of his government, but he was criticised for a keynote speech on the issue in July that contained little new policy. The new cabinet committee, which it is understood has already met twice, is a subcommittee of the government's domestic and economic strategy committee. The chief secretary to the Treasury, Simon Clarke, is its deputy chair, and ministers from across government will be asked to attend where their department's work is relevant to the aspect of levelling up being discussed.",Real Guardian,708.0
554,Real,The Guardian,"When Boris Johnson addressed restive backbenchers last week with his party gripped by a sleaze crisis, the topic of stopping small boats crossing the Channel was raised by more colleagues than any other, according to one MP present. While overall asylum applications are down on a year ago, the sharp increase in the number of arrivals by this dangerous and very visible route was described by the home secretary last week as ""unacceptable"".  Priti Patel has come under intense pressure from a No 10 heavily influenced by newspaper front pages to reduce the numbers of people making the crossing – leading to increasingly frenzied briefings about wave machines, offshore processing centres and even sending boats out to turn refugees back. Allies of Johnson say he has been personally exercised about the issue for months, with aides charged with finding solutions. It carries a particular resonance because of the constant refrain of the Brexiters that one benefit of leaving the EU would be to ""take back control"" – including of the UK's borders. In practice that had the narrow meaning of ending the free movement of people, which had led to an influx of millions of workers from Poland and other European states. But Conservative strategists know well that beneath some voters' desire to ""take back control"" will have been a suspicion of immigration more generally. And vivid front page pictures of crowded dinghies smack of anything but control. Patel told MPs last week the problem was ""complex"" and resulted from a ""global migration crisis"" but the government's solutions have tended to revolve around urging France to do more, rather than opening up safer routes for desperate refugees drawn to the UK by family ties or other pull factors. Patel's political instincts may well be to be tough on migration. But underpinning the government's stance is also the fact that Tories believe their victories in a swath of former Labour seats in 2019 was driven by marrying a leftish economic agenda with a rightwing approach on social issues including, crucially, immigration. Concerns about winning back these voters has meant Labour has repeatedly criticised Patel for her failure to halt the arrival of small boats – her shadow minister, Nick Thomas-Symonds, recently accused her of having ""lost control"" of the issue, though he also called for safer routes to be opened up, including for lone children. Meanwhile, with Conservative MPs becoming more exercised about the fraught issue, it has been weaponised by Nigel Farage, who told the Telegraph's Christopher Hope this week he was mulling a comeback to frontline politics. Farage has repeatedly filmed himself in Dover, watching for the latest arrivals, and was reporting from the Channel for his GB News show on Wednesday morning. He later tweeted: ""Sad reports of multiple deaths in the Channel. After what I saw this morning it does not come as a surprise."" While his Brexit party failed to win a single seat at the 2019 general election, Farage's impact on the direction of Conservative policy over the past five years and more is undeniable, and the fear of losing voters to a fringe party on their right flank alarms some Tories. Many Conservatives are also scarred by the long period from 2010 when they set and repeatedly failed to meet a net migration target of ""tens of thousands,"" which – with free movement from the EU in place – they simply did not have the levers to achieve. So while the shock of Wednesday's terrible tragedy may soften the hearts of the public, it appears unlikely to lead to a fundamental shift in the government's approach, which has deep political roots.",Real Guardian,608.0
555,Real,The Guardian,"The Liberal Democrats are in with a chance of taking the ultra-safe Tory seat of North Shropshire, as ""soft Conservative"" voters turn against Boris Johnson, party leader Ed Davey has claimed. The seat has been vacant since Owen Paterson resigned, after being found to have broken House of Commons rules on paid lobbying. A byelection is being held on 16 December.  The Lib Dem hopes of challenging the Conservatives in their home territory were boosted after they overturned a majority of 16,000 in the Buckinghamshire seat of Chesham and Amersham earlier this year. Winning North Shropshire would represent an even more dramatic electoral earthquake, however. Paterson's majority in 2019 was almost 23,000, and the Lib Dems took just 10% of the vote, coming behind Labour. Nevertheless, hopeful party strategists point to a stronger performance at last year's local elections, where they gained seats at the expense of the Conservatives. They also claim detailed canvassing data is stronger than expected, putting them potentially within reach of a win, particularly if they can persuade Labour and Green voters to back them. ""It's tougher than Chesham and Amersham, but we've made a really good start, we've got a really good candidate,"" said party leader Ed Davey. He has already made three visits to North Shropshire to support the Lib Dem candidate, Helen Morgan. Despite the byelection having been triggered by Paterson's disgrace, Davey said sleaze has barely come up in conversations with voters. Instead, he said they want to talk about long waits for local ambulance services, the NHS – and potholes. ""What we're finding is that there's a lot of soft Tory voters out there: much softer than we expected. There's a feeling the Tories have taken them for granted. They're very open to the idea of voting for us,"" he said. ""Without prompting, we're finding people saying on the doorstep, my neighbour had to wait eight hours for an ambulance, or my sister had to wait two hours."" ""It's much more about Boris Johnson's incompetence, than sleaze,"" he added. ""We're really clear that the Lib Dems are the challengers: if you want to send a message to Boris Johnson, vote for us."" One canvasser reported that Johnson's ""Peppa Pig"" speech earlier this week had come up, with voters mentioning it as the final straw that meant they could no longer support the Tories. The Conservative candidate is Birmingham-based lawyer Neil Shastri-Hurst, an army veteran and former surgeon who has been supported on recent canvassing sessions by Conservative chair Oliver Dowden. Shastri-Hunt has made what he called a ""cast iron commitment,"" not to take a second job, after Paterson resigned rather than submit to a 30-day suspension from the House of Commons over paid lobbying. Labour is standing a local candidate, Ben Wood, from Oswestry – but is pouring more resources into next week's byelection in Old Bexley and Sidcup, the seat made vacant by the death of former minister James Brokenshire. The pair of byelections will be the first electoral test for Johnson since the Paterson affair, which has undermined his authority with Conservative backbenchers and led to questions about his grip on government. A significant swing against the Conservatives would raise questions about the party's ability to hold on to Tory seats with smaller majorities. After the Chesham and Amersham defeat highlighted concerns among former Tory voters about the government's proposed radical overhaul of planning rules, the plans were put on pause by the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove.",Real Guardian,580.0
556,Real,The Guardian,"Keir Starmer has called Boris Johnson's social care plan a ""working-class dementia tax"", accusing the prime minister of breaking the Conservatives' manifesto promise that no one would have to sell their home to pay care costs. Challenged by the Labour leader about whether anyone would have to sell their home to pay for social care, Johnson gave a carefully worded answer.  ""We are saying to the people of this country that we will disregard your home as part of your assets if you and your spouse are living in it; and No 2, you can have a deferred payment agreement if you move out of it, and you are living in residential care,"" he said. The prime minister added that the £86,000 lifetime cap on social care costs would mean ""we are allowing the people of this country to insure themselves against the otherwise catastrophic costs of Alzheimer's and dementia"". Starmer accused the prime minister of describing the existing broken system: the value of a patient's home is already disregarded, if they or their partner are living in it, and deferred payment schemes already exist in many areas. Starmer repeatedly pointed out that under the plans, which were narrowly passed by MPs on Tuesday, individuals with assets worth just over £100,000 would ultimately lose much of the value of their property, whereas those with more valuable homes would be able to hand over a larger proportion to their families. ""He's picked the pockets of working people to protect the estates of the wealthiest,"" Starmer said, calling the scheme a ""working-class dementia tax"". Johnson was cheered by his own MPs at the start of his appearance, after a turbulent three-week period that included several backbench rebellions and some senior Tories expressing concern about his grip on government. Starmer ribbed him about the disquiet of Tory MPs, asking: ""Who knows if he'll make it to the next election?"" At another point, he quipped: ""I think he's lost his place in his notes again,"" referring to Johnson's rambling CBI speech on Monday. ""Is everything OK, prime minister?"" the Labour leader added, prompting the prime minister to reply: ""I tell you what is not working, is that line of attack,"" to noisy cheers from his backbenchers. Before responding to Starmer, the prime minister told the Labour MP Chris Bryant that the government would shortly announce a new cross-departmental strategy on acquired brain injuries – something Bryant has been campaigning for. The Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, intervened to urge MPs to behave calmly, warning that ""shouting each other down doesn't do you, or your constituents, any good"". He urged them to show the qualities of ""kindness"" and ""decency"" that he said were on display on Tuesday at the memorial service for the MP David Amess, who was killed last month.",Real Guardian,465.0
557,Real,The Guardian,"Buy-now-pay-later lenders should be regulated urgently to prevent young consumers taking on a mountain of debt they may be unable to afford, the Labour MP Stella Creasy has said. Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow, called a debate in parliament on Tuesday to draw attention to the rapid growth of companies such as Klarna.  ""My concern is that the speed at which this industry is moving, with the failure of the government to act as quickly, will have very severe repercussions for consumers this Black Friday, and this Christmas,"" she told the Guardian, in advance of the debate. ""I think politicians have consoled themselves that during the pandemic people have paid down their debts, they've saved more, they might be in a stronger financial position – but it's only those people who had money to save in the first place who were in that position. And there is a growing inequality that we haven't picked up on."" She added: ""You've already got a smouldering fire of debt, and there were people before the pandemic who were using credit cards and high-cost loans to cover their costs – who were already spinning and juggling. And into that picture has come a new form of credit, that is being aggressively marketed and shoved down their throats, without any protection at all."" Buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) lending allows consumers to pay for goods in several instalments instead of meeting the full cost up front, and many mainstream retailers now offer it to customers as a routine part of online shopping. Citizens Advice, which is also calling for the sector to be regulated, recently warned that one in 10 people are expecting to rely on buy-now-pay-later to cope with Christmas spending. The firms charge no interest, but borrowers unable to meet repayments can find themselves charged late payment fees and pursued by debt collectors. Citizens Advice research found that one in 10 BNPL users – or one in eight younger users – had been chased by a debt collector over the past year. Its director of policy, Matthew Upton, recently described using it as, ""like quicksand"". Creasy called on retailers to stop using BNFL until it is properly regulated. The government agreed to regulate BNPL lenders after an independent review chaired by City expert Christopher Woolard, published in February, warned that the sector represented a ""significant potential consumer harm"". But Creasy points out that the Treasury only published a consultation on how to do that last month, which is not due to close until the new year, and will be followed by a separate consultation by the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). By that time, she says, young consumers will have taken on millions of pounds more in debt. Creasy previously campaigned vociferously against the payday lender Wonga, which ultimately went into administration after a government crackdown, amid allegations of irresponsible lending. A Klarna spokesperson said: ""UK consumers are choosing BNPL as a more responsible way to pay, saving them money and helping them manage their finances compared to alternatives like credit cards. We offer short-term interest- and fee-free BNPL products with structured repayment plans, keeping people out of debt."" A spokesperson for the FCA said it was vital that the law kept pace with the changing nature of the credit market. ""We plan to consult on new rules soon after the Treasury's consultation is finished and they have decided which firms and activities will be regulated. We are already working on what our regulation of these firms will look like,"" they added. The Treasury was approached for comment.",Real Guardian,594.0
558,Real,The Guardian,"The cap is a lifetime limit of £86,000 on how much individuals will have to pay towards their care costs. First proposed more than a decade ago by the economist Sir Andrew Dilnot in a government-commissioned review, it is designed to allow individuals hit by hefty care costs to pass on more of their assets to their children, instead of seeing them wiped out. In September Boris Johnson announced the cap would be implemented from 2023, funded by a new £12bn-a-year ""health and social care levy"" that comes into force next April.  While MPs at Westminster were focused on the scandal over MPs' second jobs, the government published new details of how the social care cap will operate. People with assets of less than £100,000 will receive means-tested support to help them pay for their care, under the new system. But Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) guidance has revealed that only the amount these households contribute themselves – not the total cost of their care – will count towards the £86,000 cap. In other words, many will still end up paying a total of £86,000, the same contribution those with much larger assets will have to make. That approach was rejected by the Dilnot review as ""unfair for those on low incomes"" because the net effect would be that this group ""contribute more slowly, rather than contributing less overall"" than much wealthier individuals. Sally Warren, director of policy at the King's Fund, said the cap as described ""no longer protects those with lower assets from catastrophic costs"" when they need care. Torsten Bell, of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, tweeted: ""Here's a simple way to think about the problem the government has created: if you own a £1m house in the home counties, over 90% of your assets are protected. If you've got a terraced house in Hartlepool (worth £70k) you can lose almost everything."" Yes, the vote will be held on Monday evening. A cap on care costs was originally legislated for by MPs in the 2014 Care Act under David Cameron's coalition government but never implemented. That legislation will now have to be amended to make it operate in the way the government is suggesting. This could give Conservative MPs concerned about the impact on lower-income households the opportunity to express their concerns and possibly rebel against the government. No. The DHSC guidance also makes clear that, as expected and as Dilnot recommended, ""daily living costs"" will be excluded. These will be set at a nationwide flat rate of £200 a week. The guidance says: ""People will remain responsible for their daily living costs throughout their care journey, including after they reach the cap.""

Speaking to the CBI's annual conference in the Midlands, Starmer will put fiscal discipline at the heart of his party's appeal to a sector Labour believes has been alienated by Boris Johnson's government.  Starmer will tell businesses that Labour ""absolutely don't think that the solution to every problem is to throw cash at it"", promising to run ""a stable government and a tight ship"". He will highlight Rachel Reeves's tough approach to the public finances, saying: ""We will never spend money just for the sake of it."" He will also announce the creation of a new skills advisory panel, including former education secretary David Blunkett, to ensure Labour has the right policies on preparing young people for work. Labour has previously attacked the government for wasting billions of pounds during the pandemic on ""crony Covid contracts"", as it tries to chip away at the idea that the Conservatives can be trusted with taxpayers' money. Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has said a Labour government would set up an ""office for value for money"", which will scrutinise government spending decisions before taxpayer resources are committed. Labour has already made some significant spending pledges, however, including the shadow chancellor's promise of £28bn of green investment each year until the end of the decade, to facilitate the transition to net zero. Some business groups have reacted angrily to aspects of government policy in recent months, including the prime minister appearing to blame the private sector for the shortage of HGV drivers that caused a fuel crisis earlier in the autumn. Starmer will say a Labour government would seek a better long-term deal for hauliers with the EU, as he repeats the call he made in his party conference speech for the government to ""make Brexit work"". Fleshing out that idea, he will say Labour would seek regulatory equivalence for financial services; argue for Britain to maintain its data adequacy status, allowing digital firms to compete with EU rivals; and negotiate for mutual recognition of professional qualifications. ""I believe all of this is achievable by robustly defending our interests, and patiently negotiating,"" Starmer will tell his audience. Starmer has been careful to insist the issue of Brexit cannot be reopened since Labour was comprehensively defeated in the 2019 general election, having himself been instrumental in persuading his party to adopt a pro-second referendum policy. Labour hopes to unite its remain and leave-supporting voters by highlighting concerns about economic issues, including the rising cost of living, with inflation climbing, and national insurance contributions set to rise in April. Starmer's emphasis on fiscal discipline is intended to contrast with the approach of his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn. The Labour leader promised his party they will ""never again go into an election with a manifesto that is not a serious plan for government"". He has also said he does not think the big six energy companies should be brought into public ownership, in a rejection of the sweeping nationalisation Labour planned in 2019. Lord Blunkett will be joined on Labour's skills advisory panel by former senior civil servant Rachel Sandby-Thomas and businessman Praful Nargund, director of an IVF provider, Create. They will tour the country with the shadow education secretary, Kate Green, talking to teachers, children and educational experts. Blunkett said: ""Nothing can be more important than spreading what works, embedding high-quality and inspirational teaching and learning, and adapting a curriculum that provides motivation to young people at every stage, and reassurance to employers that they will have literate, numerate, creative and responsive employees for the future."" Labour has already announced that it would place careers advisers in every school, and beef up the teaching of digital skills. ""Young people are ambitious, optimistic and excited for their futures. Yet far too many are being let down by a Conservative government that's living in the past,"" Starmer will say. The CBI conference is being held across multiple sites and will also feature a speech by the prime minister, who is expected to highlight the prospects for green jobs across the economy.",Real Guardian,698.0
560,Real,The Guardian,"Covid booster jabs are likely to be offered to all adults eventually, with the independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation already considering the issue, the health secretary has suggested. Sajid Javid urged people aged 40 to 49 to come forward for their third dose of vaccine from Monday, as the offer of a booster is extended to them.  ""If it makes sense to go further, we will. The latest data shows that the boosters are immensely effective,"" he told BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show, stressing that he would follow JCVI advice. The UK reported 40,004 new cases of Covid on Sunday and 61 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Just over 450,000 booster jabs were administered, meaning there have been 15m third doses delivered. Publishing its latest recommendation for 40- to 49-year-olds to be asked to come forward for a third jab, the JCVI said last week that ""future considerations include the need for booster vaccination [third dose] for 18- to 39-year-olds who are not in an at-risk group, and whether additional booster vaccination [fourth dose] for more vulnerable adult groups may be required."" It said it would provide further advice in due course. Apparently referring to that statement, Javid told Times Radio: ""They've actually said in their recent advice that's something they would want to do in any case, to 18 and above."" The JCVI had previously recommended that over-50s and those with health conditions that make them vulnerable to the virus be given a third dose. Government sources suggested a fresh recommendation for younger adults could come within weeks. It follows research published by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) last week indicating that a third dose provides very strong protection. The UKHSA study suggested that protection against symptomatic infection for the over-50s was 93.1% for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and 94.0% for the Pfizer/BioNTech jab two weeks after a third dose of the vaccine. There are hopes in government that successful delivery of a booster programme – which has accelerated in recent weeks after a slow start – will help prevent the need for tougher restrictions over winter. It is understood ministers have been advised that with cases increasing sharply in mainland Europe, there are two possible scenarios in the coming weeks, one of which involves a sharp increase in hospitalisations and deaths and the reintroduction of restrictions. The other would be the UK benefiting from the higher immunity that has built up since the summer reopening to avoid a devastating fourth wave. It is expected to be several weeks before it is clear which course the virus is taking. Prof Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, told The Andrew Marr Show that he was hopeful about the prospects for the coming weeks, partly because the virus had been circulating more freely in the UK already. ""If we look at what's happening in other countries at the moment, they're just experiencing the start of another wave of spread of infection,"" he said. ""And the reason why the virus spreads is a combination of changes in social distancing – whether that's lockdown measures or mask wearing – plus the immunity in the population. ""We've actually had some spread going on since the summer, and so I think it's unlikely that we're going to see the very sharp rise in the next few months that's just been seen [in continental Europe] – we're already ahead of that with this particular virus, the Delta variant."" Asked about the tougher restrictions being imposed in some countries, Javid acknowledged that the winter period was likely to be difficult, but said the government would stick to its ""plan A"" of increasing booster jabs. ""We have long warned that this horrid virus likes the winter, and likes the cold, dark days that that brings, but the one big difference here is our booster programme,"" he said, pointing to the fact that 15m booster doses had so far been delivered. ""That is absolutely key for us to keep this virus at bay."" He called on people to accept the invitation to have a third dose ""because that's the best way we can look forward to the kind of Christmas that we all want to see"". The government embarked on an advertising blitz last month amid fears the booster programme had got off to a slow start. The government's plan A for tackling the virus in England, published in its autumn and winter plan, also involves reminding the public to stick to advice on mask-wearing and ventilation. Its plan B – which could be implemented if hospital capacity comes under unsustainable pressure – includes reintroducing mandatory mask-wearing, working from home guidance and vaccine passports for large venues. Boris Johnson initially announced in July that the government would make vaccine passports mandatory for venues including nightclubs, but the government abandoned the plan after vociferous objections from Conservative MPs.

561,Real,The Guardian,"Sajid Javid has said he was racially abused almost every day at school when he was growing up, as he urged the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to ""take a long, hard look at themselves"" over racism in the sport. The health secretary was asked about the crisis at Yorkshire County Cricket Club, after the stark testimony last week of the former cricketer Azeem Rafiq about his treatment at the hands of fellow players.  Javid said he had been horrified by the leaked report that emerged from the club this month, which suggested the behaviour Rafiq had been subjected to was ""banter"". At the time, Javid said ""heads should roll"" over the handling of the issue. ""It really just shocked me that in this day and age, the people doing this report would have these views, that somehow being called 'P***' was banter. It's not, it never has been,"" he told Sky News. Javid said that ""when I was growing up, I was called P*** nearly every day at school. I didn't like it then, I don't like it now."". He added: ""I think the good news is our country has come a long, long way since then, but clearly not every institution in this country has taken that journey."" Rafiq told MPs on the culture and sport select committee that the P-word was used against him ""constantly"" and that players of Asian backgrounds were told to sit near the toilets and called ""elephant washers"". Javid, whose parents migrated to the UK from Pakistan, accused Yorkshire County Cricket Club of being ""stuck in the dark ages"" in its approach. The club's chair, Roger Hutton, as well as two members of the board, resigned after the backlash over a decision not to take any disciplinary action against those involved, which resulted in sponsors withdrawing their support. Javid acknowledged a process of change at the club had begun, with a new chair, Lord Patel, installed, but said ""the ECB should be doing its job to ensure that this is taken seriously throughout cricket in the UK"". Asked whether the government should intervene in some way, Javid said he remembered meeting the ECB when he was culture secretary and being told what they planned to do about racism but ""many years later, look at what's happening, look at what's been made public"". ""I don't think the ECB has taken this issue very seriously: I think they need to take a long, hard look at themselves and now it's the real test for them, and let's see if they can pass it,"" he said, underlining the fact that culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, took the issue very seriously. Rafiq received an unreserved apology from the cricket authorities, in a statement that acknowledged ""racism and discrimination is a blight on our game"".",Real Guardian,468.0
562,Real,The Guardian,"A shame-faced Boris Johnson told his own MPs this week that he had ""crashed the car into the ditch"" by misjudging the Owen Paterson scandal. As he heads to his country retreat of Chequers this weekend, some at Westminster have begun to wonder if he has what it takes to get the show back on the road. As well as exposing Johnson's lax approach to probity in public life, the Paterson debacle highlighted what those who have worked with him say is one of his most maddening characteristics – the impetuous style of decision-making and tendency to sudden reversals cruelly caricatured by Dominic Cummings as ""like a shopping trolley"".  And it played into wider worries about his competence and whether the Downing Street machine is working as it should. ""No 10 is a really difficult job and he doesn't have the skillset to run it, he just doesn't,"" said one senior Tory. ""He's a great campaigner; a terrible administrator. But he doesn't trust anyone to run it for him."" Johnson's longtime adviser Ben ""Gazza"" Gascoigne was recently persuaded to return to his side, in a sign that all was not well with the post-Cummings setup. One Conservative MP likened the impact of the events of the past fortnight to a hurricane hitting the government. ""Obviously morale is low, and people have felt dispirited,"" he said. ""I think it's completely up to him to turn it around."" Yet Tory MPs' perceptions of Johnson are inevitably heavily influenced by his ability to help them try to hold their seats at the next general election, and so far there is only modest evidence that the negative headlines are damaging the Conservatives' appeal. ""People have noticed it, and it has added to this general sense that was already there, of a slight loss in confidence in the government compared to the giddy heights of the vaccine rollout,"" said James Johnson, a pollster with JL Partners who previously worked for Theresa May. ""What I don't think it is, is the definitive brand-changing moment for Boris Johnson."" He said the prime minister remained protected by the ""reputational screen"" of the pandemic, and the sentiment of many voters in recent focus groups he had carried out continued to be that ""they're in an unprecedented situation, they're doing their best job"". It is unclear how long that screen will continue to deflect voters' concerns about other issues. Prof Rob Ford, an elections expert at Manchester University, likened the impact of sleaze stories on a government's popularity to the children's game Jenga. ""You're watching Johnson pull Jenga blocks out from the bottom and put them on the top. You can see that the pile is becoming more unstable, but you can never really know for sure whether any particular block that you pull out is going to be the one that pulls the whole thing down."" Remembering the mid-1990s, when John Major's government was dogged by a slew of sleaze stories, he said: ""Once it sets in as an atmosphere, as a miasma, and once voters begin to expect it, then there's an air of self-fulfilling prophecy to it."" Labour strategists have long believed that by highlighting alleged corruption – whether the prime minister's wallpaper or the Covid contracts VIP lane – they can chip away at Johnson's reputation, but they wouldn't have dared hope for the self-inflicted damage of the past fortnight. ""It's brought out the best in lots of people in the party, not least Keir [Starmer] and Angela [Rayner],"" said one Labour insider, referring to the party leader and his deputy. ""It's a bit of a gift to us, the fact that Keir is strait-laced, and with his career history – he doesn't exactly scream corruption. And it also plays into Angela's strengths as someone who can really tear chunks out of them. It creates a really nice dynamic for us."" Labour is under no illusions that this alone will help it to dislodge Johnson, but it believes the cracks are starting to show on domestic policy delivery too, particularly against the backdrop of a deteriorating economic environment. Two announcements at the end of the week made clear that delivering on Johnson's promise to ""unleash Britain's potential"" in a way his voters will appreciate will not be straightforward. The cap on costs for social care and plans for new rail links across the north of England have been significantly scaled back – with red wall voters set to benefit less than had been previously expected. The changes have been driven by cost-cutting, with Rishi Sunak keen for the Conservatives to avoid clobbering the middle classes with more tax increases and to hold on to their reputation as guardians of the public purse, something he sees as a key dividing line with Labour. But Sunak's cautious approach underlines the tensions between the disparate groups of voters who handed Johnson his majority in 2019 – the red wall of newly Tory seats, and the blue wall across the home counties, now firmly in the Liberal Democrats' sights after their victory in Chesham and Amersham. ""The two halves of the Conservative coalition, the only thing they agree on is 'get Brexit done',"" said Ford.",Real Guardian,865.0
563,Real,The Guardian,"The health secretary, Sajid Javid, is facing questions over share options he continues to hold in the hi-tech US company he worked for until rejoining the cabinet in June – and which operates in the healthcare sector. Javid was paid the equivalent of £150,000 a year by C3.ai, a California firm specialising in artificial intelligence (AI), from October last year until he was given the job of health secretary.  As part of his remuneration package, he was also given ""an option for 666.7 shares per month"". According to the health secretary's current entry in the register of MPs' interests, he continues to hold these options, which he reports have a market value of approximately £45,000. The deputy Labour leader, Angela Rayner, has written to the prime minister's ethics adviser, Lord Geidt, to ask him whether this represents a conflict of interest. ""In September, the secretary of state's department announced that the use of AI would shorten waiting lists in our NHS,"" she wrote, suggesting the idea the Department of Health could spend taxpayers' money on AI ""could clearly be perceived as beneficial to an AI company"". The ministerial code states that ""ministers must scrupulously avoid any danger of an actual or perceived conflict of interest between their ministerial position and their private financial interest"". Employee share options usually allow the recipient to buy a set number of shares at a predetermined price, sometimes on a particular future date. Their value fluctuates with the company's share price, so they are used to give staff an interest in the company's value appreciating. Details of when Javid's options can be cashed in have not been published. C3.ai is a California-based tech firm which floated on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2020. Among nine industry sectors listed on its website, it includes ""healthcare"" and ""government"". It has a UK subsidiary, and is now recruiting sales and marketing staff in the UK. Javid advised the firm on ""the global economy, geo-politics and market opportunities"". The NHS was already increasing spending on AI before Javid arrived in post, but he recently highlighted its potential role in tackling health injustices. ""Technology, particularly AI, can be an incredible force for good. It can save valuable clinician time and help provide faster, more accurate diagnosis, so patients can access the care they need as quickly as possible,"" he said. ""It can also help us better understand racial differences so we can train our workforce to look for different symptoms or complicating factors, diagnose faster, and tailor treatments."" Javid held the post at C3.ai alongside another advisory role, with US bank JP Morgan from August 2020 to June 2021, for which he was also paid the equivalent of £150,000 a year. He took up that role six months after resigning as chancellor. Javid previously worked for JP Morgan before entering parliament. Both of these jobs were cleared with the independent Advisory Committee on Business Appointments, which vets jobs for former ministers. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said: ""The secretary of state has acted in line with the ministerial code and has properly declared these share options in the usual way."" Aides suggested he had begun the process of divesting himself of the options when he became health secretary, but that the process was difficult because the market for share options is not very liquid. Javid unexpectedly became health secretary in June, when Matt Hancock resigned after being caught on camera in a clinch with Gina Coladangelo, a longtime friend who had been brought on to the DHSC's payroll.",Real Guardian,597.0
564,Real,The Guardian,"Prince Andrew took out a £1.5m personal loan that was subsequently paid off by companies connected to David Rowland, a multimillionaire Conservative donor and financier, it has been claimed. Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday that the Duke of York took out the loan with the Luxembourg-based private bank Banque Havilland in December 2017, and it was paid off 11 days later by companies associated with Rowland, the bank's founder.  Bloomberg claimed it had seen documents confirming that the transactions had taken place, with the money being wired to Andrew's London account via an account held by Albany Reserves Ltd, of which Rowland is a director. The loan – which reportedly had already been repeatedly extended, most recently by £250,000 – was allowed on the basis that it could open up ""further business potential with the royal family,"" the report alleged. Rowland and the duke have had a close relationship for some years. He was the guest of honour at the official opening of Banque Havilland, which was created out of the Luxembourg arm of the collapsed lender Kaupthing in the wake of the global financial crisis. It was previously reported by the Mail on Sunday that Rowland helped pay off debts incurred by the duke's ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson. At the time, the duchess' spokesperson said the deal was above board. Rowland was announced as the treasurer of the Conservative party in 2010, but withdrew before taking up the role after stories emerged suggesting he had previously been a tax exile in Guernsey. A property magnate and banker, Rowland has donated more than £6m to the Conservatives over recent years. A spokesperson for the Duke of York said: ""We don't intend to comment on the veracity or otherwise of the string of assertions you have put to us, other than to state that the duke is entitled to a degree of privacy in conducting his entirely legitimate personal financial affairs, on which all appropriate accounting measures are undertaken and all taxes duly paid."" A spokesperson for Banque Havilland said: ""Due to relevant laws and regulations the bank cannot comment on alleged clients or transactions. Like all financial institutions, we are subject to routine inspections and audits and provide all necessary disclosures. Compliance with legal and regulatory requirements are the foremost priority of the bank. Any inference of wrongdoing is categorically denied."" The Conservative party declined to comment. Rowland did not respond to emails and text messages from Bloomberg inquiring about the terms of the transfer. The story has thrown the spotlight on the finances of the Queen's second son, who is already facing allegations of sexual abuse, which he has consistently denied. Andrew was previously a government trade envoy but stepped down in 2011 amid questions about his friendship with the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Virginia Giuffre is suing Andrew in the US, accusing him of sexually abusing her when she was under 18, including at two homes belonging to Epstein. It has been reported that the Queen is funding Andrew's defence. The Metropolitan police announced last month that they would take no further action over Guiffre's claims, after reviewing documents related to the case. The duke broke his silence about these and other allegations in a widely watched BBC interview in 2019 in which he sought to discredit Guiffre's story. He subsequently stepped down from all public engagements after a public backlash to his TV testimony. Ghislaine Maxwell, a close friend of the duke whom he invited to Buckingham Palace, is on trial in New York charged with sex crimes, conspiracy and perjury related to Epstein's activities. The duke is believed to receive £250,000 annually from his mother, the Queen, as well as a navy pension.

565,Real,The Guardian,"Chris Bryant is so fed up being lobbied by MPs on behalf of their colleagues that he's decided to report the next one who sidles up for a quiet word – straight to the parliamentary commissioner for standards. Bryant, whose cross-party committee polices MPs' conduct, describes an increase in attempts to influence due process in recent months, culminating in Boris Johnson's extraordinary botched attempt to overturn the verdict against Owen Paterson.  ""It's: 'Chris. Can I just bend your ear …?' Absolutely not!"" he says. ""It has happened quite a lot over the last year, most notably over the Owen Paterson case but also a couple of others. And in the past, my view has been: 'Right, I'm just going to tell you you're not allowed to lobby.' My new version is: the moment anybody lobbies me I will simply report it to the commissioner and then the commissioner can decide what to do with it."" The commissioner, Kathryn Stone, investigates MPs' conduct. But it is Bryant's committee which then decides what sanctions they should face, with MPs given the final say – though this is usually a formality. Since Johnson's bid to clear Paterson opened the way to a maelstrom of allegations about MPs' financial interests, Bryant has found himself cast as the scourge of the government. The Labour MP's coruscating speech in the Paterson debate was heard in a silence rare for the House of Commons, as he warned that if MPs followed Johnson's lead, Paterson's name would become a byword for wrongdoing. Speaking to the Guardian from his Welsh constituency of Rhondda this week, he warned that MPs may now have to endure months of intense scrutiny. ""My guess is that there'll be stories all the way through to Christmas,"" he says. ""And this angers me, because the government has led us all into this quagmire."" Bryant first came across Johnson at Oxford University in the 1980s when Johnson was president of the debating club the Oxford Union. ""We were at university together. He's a bit younger than me,"" says Bryant, 59. He only recalls coming across the mop-headed future prime minister on a couple of occasions but says his character was already clear. ""You know, he was then almost exactly as he is now."" Asked if he means Johnson took a relaxed attitude to rules, Bryant bristles. ""I don't think he's relaxed at all. It's quite the opposite of relaxed. I think he thinks he's Samson. He wants to pull the temple down on top of his head. And what is irritating I think, particularly for lots of Tories, in particular new Tories, is that they had no idea what deluge would come. And if you pull the building down on top of you, people tend to get hurt. Completely capriciously."" The biblical comparison perhaps comes naturally because Bryant was a vicar before becoming a politician. Despite his theological roots, he insists he never intended to set himself up as parliament's moral guardian, however. ""I do not think of myself as a saint. So I hate the idea of some kind of great witchfinder who's out there to snatch people into the back of my van,"" he says. ""I have as many clay feet as anybody else and I'm not a judgmental person by nature."" Nevertheless, in his 20-year parliamentary career, he has often strayed into what he calls ""warm water"" – setting himself against foes including the Kremlin and the Murdoch press. More recently, he graphically detailed his successful treatment for skin cancer. Bryant rejects the word ""sleaze"", seeing it as an unhelpful catch-all. ""I don't like the word sleaze because it's so untargeted. You know, 20 years ago sleaze included just being gay."" Bryant's civil partnership with Jared Cranney was the first same-sex relationship celebrated at the House of Commons, in 2010. Rather than sleaze, Bryant believes it is conflicts of interest that damage the standing of parliament. ""If people think that you are really not interested in serving the public and you're really only interested in serving some kind of commercial gain, then I think they look on that very ill,"" he says. ""And also then when it accumulates then people start to go: 'Hang on, it didn't pass the sniff test last week. Now there's a really sulphurous smell about the place.'"" He says the ""vast majority"" of MPs have no conflict of interest but all are damaged by the perception that politicians are on the take. The prime minister felt the need to insist this week that the UK is ""not remotely a corrupt country"". Bryant is less complacent. ""There are clearly the first spots of corruption on the windscreen but, more importantly, the danger is we are corrupting,"" he says, pointing not only to the Paterson case but to the government's habit of doling out pots of money to handpicked constituencies. ""I don't like the levelling-up fund because basically it's ministers deciding where to award money, I think that will inevitably lead to corrupting – and every step that you take down that yellow brick road gets you further away from probity.""

566,Real,The Guardian,"The government faces a legal challenge to Boris Johnson's decision to back Priti Patel over bullying allegations, throwing a fresh spotlight on the prime minister's approach to ethics in public life. Alex Allan, Johnson's independent adviser on the ministerial code, resigned last year after the prime minister chose not to act on a critical report about Patel.  After a Cabinet Office investigation, citing instances in which she had shouted and sworn at staff, Allan found Patel had displayed ""behaviour that can be described as bullying"" and that she had ""not consistently met the high standards expected of her"". His report suggested she had breached the ministerial code, even if unintentionally. Johnson decided she had not breached the code, however, and subsequently urged his colleagues to ""form a square around the Prittster"". The FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, has brought a judicial review of his decision, probing the legal status of the ministerial code, which will be heard at the Royal Courts of Justice next Wednesday and Thursday. Dave Penman, the FDA's general secretary, said: ""Civil servants should expect to work with ministers without fear of being bullied or harassed. ""The prime minister's decision, which he said reflected the home secretary's assertion that her actions were unintentional, also potentially allows ministers to avoid the consequences of their behaviour in future by pleading that it should be the intent of their actions which is important, not the consequences. ""The result is that civil servants' confidence in challenging unacceptable behaviour from ministers has been fatally damaged."" He added that 90% of civil servants in a recent survey carried out by the union said they had no confidence in the ministerial code as a way of dealing with bullying or harassment by ministers. Johnson took the unusual step earlier this week of insisting the UK is ""not remotely a corrupt country"", amid a slew of sleaze claims after his botched bid to protect disgraced former MP Owen Paterson from a 30-day suspension for paid lobbying. Decisions on whether backbench MPs have breached their code of conduct are taken by the cross-party committee for standards, after an investigation by the independent watchdog, Kathryn Stone, and must then be rubber-stamped by the House of Commons. But the prime minister is the ultimate arbiter of whether the ministerial code has been broken – and Johnson chose to override Allan's findings in Patel's case. The home secretary subsequently reached a six-figure settlement with the former permanent secretary of her department, Sir Philip Rutnam, after claims that he was forced out of his job for intervening in her alleged bullying. Whitehall sources said that Rutnam received a £340,000 settlement with a further £30,000 in costs. He had threatened to take the home secretary to an employment tribunal hearing. Resigning in February last year, Rutnam claimed he had been the victim of a ""vicious and orchestrated campaign against him"", which Patel had organised. Patel has consistently denied that claim and rejected allegations of bullying. A report from the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, published last week, urged the government to strengthen the powers of the independent adviser on ministers' interests – currently Lord Geidt, who was appointed to succeed Allan. The committee said he should be able to launch his own investigations; his reports should be published promptly; and the government should publish the range of sanctions that could be applied to ministers who breach the rules in future. ""Meaningful independence is the benchmark for any effective form of standards regulation and current arrangements for the adviser still fall below this bar,"" the committee said.",Real Guardian,600.0
567,Real,The Guardian,"Keir Starmer decided himself not to take a lucrative second job at law firm Mishcon de Reya in the summer of 2017, a spokesperson for the Labour leader has insisted. Jeremy Corbyn's allies have claimed Starmer was instructed not to take on the job by Labour's then political director, Katy Clark, because Corbyn, then leader, believed it to be incompatible with his role as shadow Brexit secretary. ""Katy Clark passed on the requirement to Keir: it was not a request,"" said one Corybn-era source.  Two sources also said Corbyn raised at a shadow cabinet meeting his general view that senior frontbenchers should not take on second jobs, adding that the then leader did so without naming Starmer specifically. However, a spokesperson for Starmer flatly denied that account of events on Thursday, calling it ""completely untrue"". ""Keir had already said no to the offer before the leader's office were even aware of it,"" the spokesperson added, referring to Corbyn's immediate team. The contradictory accounts underline the continuing deep suspicion between Starmer's team and that of his immediate predecessor. The Labour party is embroiled in costly legal action against five senior members of Corbyn's inner circle over claims they leaked a contentious internal report. Corbyn remains suspended from the Labour whip over his response to the publication of a critical report by the Equality and Human Rights Commission about the party's handling of antisemitism complaints. Starmer had held discussions in mid-2017 with the City law firm about advising its ""academy"" – described on the company's website as, ""Mishcon de Reya's in-house place of learning, our driver for growth and a platform for thought leadership"". According to Starmer's register of financial interests, he had previously spent four months in 2016 as a legal adviser to the academy. He was paid £4,500 a month for six hours' work, but gave up the role when he joined Labour's frontbench as shadow Brexit secretary. His allies said that as soon as he was approached the following year, Starmer knew the job was incompatible with being in the shadow cabinet. At the time, the Conservative MP James Cleverly raised the question of the job publicly. He wrote to Starmer to say: ""Members of the public will rightly detect a conflict of interest between your paid work for a law firm and your important role on the frontbench."" Starmer then released a statement saying he had ""decided not to further the discussions"". The Labour leader was asked on Sky News earlier this week about whether he was wrong to have been in talks with the law firm. ""No I wasn't,"" he replied. ""There was discussion, nothing happened."" Labour's 2019 manifesto included a commitment to ban MPs from taking on any paid second job at all. Its current policy is that MPs should not carry out political consultancy. More than a quarter of Conservative MPs have second jobs, making a total of more than £4m in extra earnings in a year, according to Guardian analysis.",Real Guardian,497.0
568,Real,The Guardian,"Rishi Sunak has become the most senior government figure to express regret over the Owen Paterson affair, saying the government ""must do better"" in upholding standards in public life, as Conservative MPs continue to be mired in sleaze allegations. The prime minister took the unusual step on Wednesday of insisting the UK was ""not remotely a corrupt country,"" after a tumultuous week in which he reversed a decision to prevent the former MP, Paterson, being censured for paid lobbying.  Since the botched attempt to protect Paterson, a string of stories has emerged about Tory MPs with lucrative outside interests. But Johnson has not apologised for initially trying to avert a 30-day suspension for the disgraced former MP. Sunak, himself a multimillionaire, was asked about the probity of MPs taking on second jobs in addition to the £82,000 they receive for representing their constituents. ""I think people will have different motivations for doing what they do,"" he said. ""The pay is set by an independent body. That's absolutely right,"" he told Sky News. ""And with regard to second jobs, there's an independent process that we have that is set by parliament that governs all of those things and it's absolutely right that process is followed to the letter."" He added: ""On the broader point and just reflecting over recent events, I think for us as a government, it's fair to say that we need to do better than we did last week and we know that."" Sunak's comments came as Lord Evans, the independent chair of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said MPs should not be spending a ""huge amount of time"" on a second job. Referring to recommendations his committee made in 2018, he said: ""We said that the critical thing was that nothing that an MP does should get in the way of their ability to work in support of their constituents – so the amount of work they do, the sort of work, needs to be judged against that. If somebody is spending a huge amount of their time on a second job, then they can't be maintaining support for their constituents."" Asked how much time on an external job was appropriate, after revelations that Cox had taken part in a lengthy inquiry on behalf of the British Virgin Islands authorities, Evans asked: ""Is it clear that the MP, who has been elected by their constituents, that their main focus, their main priority is on being the best MP that they can be?"" Boris Johnson pointedly declined to defend Cox when given the opportunity to do so on Wednesday. Instead he emphasised that all MPs should put their constituents first, and that those who broke the rules must be punished. Cox released a statement on Wednesday in which he said it was up to the standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, to judge whether he had broken parliamentary rules – and up to his constituents to decide whether he should continue to be their MP. ""Sir Geoffrey's view is that it is up to the electors of Torridge and West Devon whether or not they vote for someone who is a senior and distinguished professional in his field and who still practises that profession,"" the statement said. Evans urged the government to implement recent recommendations made by his committee, which was set up by the former Conservative prime minister, John Major, after the cash-for-questions scandal. In a report published last week, before the Paterson affair, the committee called for a series of changes, including better transparency around lobbying and tougher oversight of ministerial behaviour. Decisions about whether a minister has breached the ministerial code lie solely with the prime minister. Alex Allan, the prime minister's independent adviser on ethics, resigned last year after Johnson chose not to act on a report about the home secretary, Priti Patel. Allan found Patel had displayed ""behaviour that can be described as bullying"" and that she had ""not consistently met the high standards expected of her"".",Real Guardian,665.0
569,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson has insisted that the UK is ""not remotely a corrupt country"" and said MPs should be investigated and punished for breaking the rules, as the Conservative party continues to be embroiled in allegations of sleaze. Speaking in Glasgow, where he was making a brief visit to the Cop26 climate summit as it entered its final days, the prime minister sought to reassure the public after a slew of revelations about the private earnings of his party colleagues. ""I genuinely believe that the UK is not remotely a corrupt country, nor do I believe that our institutions are corrupt,"" he said.  He declined to comment directly on individual MPs, including the former attorney general Sir Geoffrey Cox, who is under fire over his £1m-plus annual earnings as a barrister. But Johnson said: ""I think what you've got is cases where, sadly, MPs have broken the rules in the past, may be guilty of breaking the rules today. What I want to see is them facing appropriate sanctions … The most important thing is, those who break the rules must be investigated and should be punished."" He was speaking a week after whipping Conservative MPs to back an amendment that sought to avert punishment for Owen Paterson – an MP found to have broken the rules – by tearing up the parliamentary standards system. Johnson reversed that decision less than 24 hours later after a backlash from Conservative MPs, and has since tabled a motion unpicking the amendment, which MPs will vote on next week. Paterson has since resigned. Amid a flurry of claims about MPs' lucrative second jobs and whether they create conflicts of interest, Johnson said in many cases the public believed this outside work ""has actually strengthened our democracy"". He said for a hundred years MPs had also worked as ""doctors or lawyers or soldiers or firefighters"". But Johnson stressed that if such second jobs were to continue, ""it is crucial that MPs follow the rules"" by devoting themselves primarily to their constituents and avoiding ""paid advocacy"". ""Anybody who breaks the rules, who engages in paid advocacy in the House of Commons, should be punished,"" he said. Parliament's standards committee found Paterson had committed an ""egregious"" breach of the rules by repeatedly lobbying the government on behalf of two companies paying him more than £100,000 a year. Cox released a statement defending his actions on Wednesday. ""He does not believe that he breached the rules, but will of course accept the judgment of the parliamentary commissioner or of the committee on the matter,"" said the statement, worded entirely in the third person. His is only the latest of a string of cases brought to light in the past week after the prime minister's botched attempt to protect Paterson. The Guardian revealed on Tuesday that Iain Duncan Smith chaired a taskforce advising the government that made recommendations on how hand sanitiser should be regulated – while being paid £25,000 a year by a company that manufactures hand sanitiser.",Real Guardian,501.0
570,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson will make a day trip to the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow on Wednesday to urge climate negotiators to ""pull out all the stops"" – travelling by train, after he was criticised for flying back by private jet last week. The prime minister attended the opening days of the summit with scores of other world leaders before returning to Westminster and leaving the Cop president, Alok Sharma, to oversee the complex negotiations. He will attend on Wednesday but is not set to be in Glasgow at the end of the summit this weekend, as some had expected.  ""I'll be meeting with ministers and negotiators to hear about where progress has been made and where the gaps must be bridged,"" the prime minister said in remarks released before his visit. ""This is bigger than any one country and it is time for nations to put aside differences and come together for our planet and our people. We need to pull out all the stops if we're going to keep 1.5C within our grasp."" Some progress was made last week on specific issues such as deforestation and the phasing out of coal. But in the broader negotiations, there are concerns about both the scale of the emissions pledges made, and when they should be updated, with some countries keen to see an annual process. A report published by the respected Climate Action Tracker (CAT) coalition on Tuesday suggested the 2030 goals set by countries at the summit could put the world on course for a catastrophic 2.4C of heating by the end of this century. In a press conference at Cop last week, the prime minister described himself as ""cautiously optimistic"" about the outcome of the summit but called on countries to be more ambitious. There had been some suggestions Johnson would attend the final stages of the negotiations. These are due to end on Friday but previous Cop gatherings have often stretched well into the weekend, and Johnson is due to mark Remembrance Sunday in London. Downing Street has therefore decided the prime minister will attend on Wednesday only. The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, said Beijing, not Glasgow, should be the target of Johnson's last-minute bid to energise the talks. ""The UK must unite the west to get China into a better place,"" said Davey, a former energy secretary. ""If Glasgow's Cop fails, we will be letting down future generations and the sense of anger and frustration in our country will be palpable. Failure is not an option."" The prime minister is travelling by train after being criticised for flying back to London last Tuesday and attending a dinner with the former Telegraph editor Charles Moore, a climate sceptic. While delegates in Glasgow have continued discussing the planet's future, Johnson has been embroiled in a sleaze scandal after whipping his MPs to support a bid to protect veteran Tory MP Owen Paterson from being punished for paid lobbying. Paterson has since resigned. The House of Commons is on a short recess from Wednesday until next Monday, so Johnson will not miss a session of prime minister's questions.",Real Guardian,520.0
571,Real,The Guardian,"Tom Morrison, the Liberal Democrat candidate for the marginal Conservative seat of Cheadle, only realised this week's Westminster sleaze crisis would be picked up by constituents when he was buttonholed by a former Tory voter in Aldi. ""There was a real air of disappointment: 'Why is he [Boris Johnson] doing this?' And then he said: 'It's just not fair,'"" Morrison says. The Lib Dems, who came second to the Tories in 90 seats in December 2019, are targeting voters they call ""soft Conservatives"" who backed Johnson at the last general election but may have reservations about him now – not least because of the perception of sleaze.  Canvassers in Chesham and Amersham, where the Lib Dems overturned a 16,000 majority to take the seat in June, also said they heard repeatedly from former Tory voters who felt let down by Johnson's government. It is a fear of this cut-through to voters that will be causing jitters among ministers, and which helped contribute to a screeching U-turn after a 48-hour shambles over lobbying this week. ""There's almost a drumbeat of sleaze that's happening all the time now, and that's why it's cutting through,"" said Morrison. ""I think previously people have voted Conservative because there's a sense of responsibility, and this just flies in the face of that – and that's what really disappoints people."" Johnson's kamikaze attempt to protect the longstanding MP Owen Paterson from a 30-day suspension after he was found by the independent sleaze watchdog to have lobbied on behalf of two companies, was the latest example of this government pushing the boundaries of probity. But the boldness of the move – with the Conservatives whipping their MPs to protect a colleague who was paid more than £100,000 a year and had approached ministers and officials more than a dozen times, underlined a view in No 10 that voters barely notice such issues. But the opposition parties certainly noticed. The Lib Dems highlight Conservative MPs in their target seats, including Steve Brine in Winchester, Alex Chalk in Cheltenham and Bim Afolami in Hitchin and Harpenden, who voted for the amendment to save Paterson on Wednesday. Both they and Labour believe Johnson's amorality is a chink in the government's armour that they hope to exploit. Certainly the latest YouGov poll, carried out after the Paterson debacle, showed the Conservatives' lead fall to just one point – 36% to Labour's 35%. Elections experts say it is also important to watch the ""don't knows"". Many may have voted Conservative in 2019 and have concerns about the Johnson regime, but have not yet alighted on an alternative. Keir Starmer's noticeably punchier approach this week – calling Johnson's behaviour ""corrupt"" and accusing him of ""leading his troops through the sewer"" – reflected Labour's belief that voters are beginning to notice a pattern of behaviour. The Labour leader laid a heavy focus on questions over the financing of Johnson's No 10 flat during the disastrous Hartlepool byelection campaign in May, which Labour lost, with analysts subsequently raising questions about whether sleaze matters at the ballot box. But Hartlepool's new MP, Jill Mortimer, was among the 13 Conservatives who defied a vigorous whipping operation to vote against the save-Paterson amendment on Wednesday. Paula Surridge, an elections expert and deputy director of the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank, points to some evidence that new Conservative voters – those who backed Labour in 2015 but supported Johnson in 2019 – are more concerned about issues of fairness and corruption than longtime Tory voters. When asked in the British Election Study whether they agreed that ""there is one law for the rich and one for the poor"", for example, 48% of loyal Conservative voters agreed, compared with 76% of Labour-to-Conservative switchers. Similarly, 26% of loyal Conservatives disagreed against just 9% of ""new"" Conservatives. After the parliamentary battles of the Brexit process, Johnson was able to paint himself as being on the side of the leave-voting public against the Westminster elite – making the point visually during the December 2019 election by literally driving a bulldozer through a wall of polystyrene bricks. Surridge says: ""For the Conservatives, a concern must be that being seen by voters as protecting those with wealth and power could undermine the connection with their new voters. While currently the Labour party seems to struggle to capitalise on this, there is a danger of voters tuning out and staying home. In close contests, who votes might be the difference between winning and losing."" The Lib Dems believe Rishi Sunak's tax-raising budgets will also play badly with potential Tory switchers. Recent internal polling showed 61% of 2019 Conservative voters think Sunak will raise their taxes. Johnson faces a series of tests in the coming weeks with byelections looming not just in Paterson's seat of North Shropshire, but in Old Bexley and Sidcup after the death of James Brokenshire, and also Southend West – though the latter will not be contested, out of respect for David Amess, who was killed last month. Both Paterson's and Brokenshire's seats are regarded as super-safe – but Chesham and Amersham was also seen as an impossible target before the Lib Dems took it in June.",Real Guardian,864.0
572,Real,The Guardian,"Labour has confirmed it will put up a candidate in the North Shropshire byelection – the seat about to be vacated by the disgraced former Conservative cabinet minister Owen Paterson. There had been suggestions that opposition parties could band together to support an ""anti-sleaze"" candidate, after Paterson stepped aside following a botched attempt by Boris Johnson to protect him from punishment for paid lobbying.  A Labour spokesperson said a candidate from the party would definitely stand. ""We're not in the business of alliances: we're in the business of putting forward a Labour candidate, with Labour values,"" they said. It is understood no formal talks with other opposition parties had taken place about the idea of uniting behind an independent anti-corruption candidate. In the 1997 general election, the former journalist Martin Bell stood as an independent candidate against the Tory MP Neil Hamilton, who had been accused of taking cash to ask parliamentary questions. He overturned Hamilton's 22,000 majority to win the seat of Tatton. Opposition sources said electoral legislation passed since 1997 made it impossible to share data and resources between separate parties in a way they were able to in Tatton. Labour came second in the seat in 2019, but the Liberal Democrats have made advances in recent local elections and believe they are more likely to attract Tory switchers than Labour. ""We're in quite a strong position,"" said a Lib Dem source. Paterson was found by the independent parliamentary standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, to have lobbied ministers and officials repeatedly on behalf of two firms that were paying him more than £100,000 a year. Johnson whipped Conservative MPs on Wednesday to support an extraordinary attempt to revisit Paterson's case and overhaul the entire parliamentary standards regime. The parliamentary motion passed, in effect lifting the 30-day suspension Paterson had expected to face – but the prime minister then withdrew the government's support less than 24 hours later after the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, accused him of ""corruption"". Paterson won his North Shropshire seat by a majority of almost 23,000 at the last general election in 2019. Starmer, who has been in self-isolation after testing positive for Covid, has taken a noticeably more punchy tone against Johnson in recent days, accusing him of ""leading his troops through the sewer"" after the attempt to protect Paterson. Conservative MPs erupted in fury after Johnson's U-turn on Thursday, accusing him – and the Tory chief whip, Mark Spencer – of making a catastrophic misjudgment by setting out to protect an individual.",Real Guardian,419.0
573,Real,The Guardian,"He faced the prospect of a 30-day suspension from the House of Commons – a penalty that appeared to have been lifted on Wednesday, at least temporarily, after Boris Johnson backed an attempt to tear up parliament's anti-sleaze system.  On Wednesday Paterson said he looked forward to trying to clear his name after being found to have lobbied the government on behalf of companies that were paying him more than £100,000. But after Johnson withdrew his support, Paterson's hopes of being allowed to reopen his case evaporated. In his statement he also said he feared his wife's suicide becoming a ""political football"". He has previously linked her death to the investigation into his conduct. A complete 180-degree U-turn on its position on Wednesday night. Ministers will now table a new motion – probably as soon as early next week – unpicking the one passed on Wednesday. Wednesday's motion paused judgment on the Paterson lobbying case while a cross-party committee examined the Commons' standards system with a view to establishing some kind of appeals process. The committee was to be chaired by the former culture secretary John Whittingdale. He was investigated by a previous parliamentary commissioner for standards over a trip to the MTV Europe awards in Amsterdam in 2013 with his then girlfriend, a dominatrix sex worker. The motion protecting Paterson was passed after Boris Johnson whipped Conservative MPs to support it – a highly unusual decision that Labour's Keir Starmer called ""corrupt"". According to Johnson's spokesperson, it was because he realised the plans for a committee set out in the Andrea Leadsom amendment he backed on Wednesday could not go ahead once Labour and the SNP had said they would boycott it. But No 10 had also faced a significant backlash from Tory MPs about what they saw as the grubbiness of the manoeuvre, which conflated Paterson's position with broader issues about the system for policing MPs' behaviour. Johnson is also notoriously fixated on newspaper headlines, and on Thursday even the usually supportive Daily Mail called the move to protect Paterson ""shameless"". He announced on Thursday afternoon that he would now step down from parliament rather than face the potential humiliation of a byelection. The government had planned to table a motion early next week to unpick Wednesday's vote by reinstating Paterson's suspension and dissolving the mooted cross-party committee. It was not planning to whip MPs, but given that Leadsom's amendment only passed with a narrow majority of 18 on a three-line Conservative whip, the motion undoing it would have been highly likely to pass. Paterson's 30-day suspension was long enough to have triggered the parliamentary recall process. That means if 10% of his constituents signed a petition, a byelection would have to be held. In accordance with arcane parliamentary procedure, in order to surrender his seat on the green benches Paterson will have to be formally appointed to one of two historic non-jobs, crown steward and bailiff of either the Chiltern Hundreds or the Manor of Northstead. A byelection will then be scheduled and could take place within weeks. While he won the seat with a thumping majority of more than 22,000 in 2019, opposition parties are likely to campaign hard on the issue of sleaze. Dates have not yet been set for two other byelections in Conservative-held seats, Southend West, whose MP David Amess was stabbed to death last month, and Old Bexley and Sidcup, the constituency of the former minister James Brokenshire, who recently died of cancer. Opposition parties have agreed not to stand candidates in Southend West out of respect for Amess's memory. That is unclear. Announcing the government's dramatic change of position on Thursday morning, the leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said the government still believed there was a case for an appeals process to be introduced. He conceded, however, that it had been wrong to link calls for reforms to the process to an individual case, and he promised to seek cross-party consensus on the way forward. He did not specify whether that would take place through the existing cross-party parliamentary standards committee, chaired by Chris Bryant, or in some other forum. There is still likely to have to be a House of Commons vote to undo the results of Wednesday's motion.",Real Guardian,713.0
574,Real,The Guardian,"Keir Starmer says Labour will boycott the commission set up to overhaul the parliamentary sleaze system, after MPs voted to protect the Conservative MP Owen Paterson from suspension over lobbying claims, calling it a ""complete and utter sham"". Boris Johnson threw his weight behind an amendment tabled by former leader of the house Andrea Leadsom, which halts Paterson's punishment until a new cross-party committee, chaired by John Whittingdale, examines the standards system.  But the Labour leader has said his party will not participate in the committee, throwing into doubt whether the plan can proceed. In an article for the Guardian, he accused the Conservatives of ""wallowing in sleaze"", comparing the situation to an employee of a company found to have misused their position, where ""instead of slinging them out, their mates at the company decided to exonerate them and shut down the HR department instead. ""Instead of trying to sort things out, we have a government that wants to stitch things up,"" Starmer said. ""Their plan is to permanently weaken the structures that hold MPs to high standards. They've appointed their own man to oversee the process – a Tory MP who not long ago was the prime minister's wife's boss – and gifted themselves a majority on a committee to set the new rules. ""It would be laughable if it wasn't so serious. The Labour party won't have anything to do with this complete and utter sham process."" Despite a significant Tory rebellion in the face of a three-line whip, the amendment passed by 250 votes to 232, after a highly charged debate in the House of Commons. Johnson earlier insisted he was against paid lobbying, saying he was supporting the Leadsom amendment on the grounds of ""natural justice"". ""The issue in this case which involves a serious family tragedy is whether a member of this house had a fair opportunity to make representations in this case, and whether as a matter of natural justice our procedures in this house allow for proper appeal"" The 30-day suspension was recommended after Paterson was found to have repeatedly breached rules on paid lobbying, approaching the government on behalf of two firms that were paying him £100,000. Chris Bryant, the chair of the Commons standards committee, warned Paterson that if Leadsom's amendment passed, his name would become ""a byword for bad behaviour"", and made clear that he had had the opportunity to make his case repeatedly.",Real Guardian,405.0
575,Real,The Guardian,"Much of the anger among Conservative MPs keen to overturn the verdict against their colleague Owen Paterson has been focused on the independent parliamentary commissioner for standards, Kathryn Stone. They argue that her approach is high-handed, and her investigations ""amateurish"", in the words of one Paterson ally, the former Brexit secretary David Davis. But her supporters insist this criticism just reflects Stone's determination to take on vested interests.  Employed by parliament, rather than the government, to safeguard independence, Stone is the sixth commissioner since the post was created in 1995. She has previously published highly critical reports on the behaviour of the former Labour MP Keith Vaz and the DUP MP Ian Paisley Jr. If Stone decides a sufficiently serious breach of the rules on MPs' conduct has taken place she can refer the case to parliament's committee on standards, which is chaired by the Labour MP Chris Bryant. Stone picked up responsibility for the Vaz inquiry, involving claims that he had procured drugs for sex workers, from her predecessor Kathryn Hudson. When that inquiry reported, resulting in a six-month suspension for Vaz, then the MP for Leicester East, she complained he had ""failed, repeatedly, to answer direct questions, given incomplete answers and his account [had], in parts, been incredible"", underlining her willingness to be tough with MPs where necessary. More recently she announced she would be reviewing the MPs' code of conduct to reflect their use of Twitter and other social media, saying in her annual report: ""I have been surprised at the way some MPs express their views and opinions on social media."" She opened 26 inquiries between 2020 and 2021, 11 of those on her own initiative, and the rest after cases were referred to her. Stone was born in Derby and went to school in nearby Belper before taking a degree in sociology and a masters in women's studies at Loughborough University. She has a long history of tackling politically contentious issues. She previously served as the commissioner for victims and survivors in Northern Ireland, with the delicate task of tackling the legacy of the Troubles. Stone was also a commissioner for the Independent Police Complaints Commission, overseeing investigations, including into the Rotherham force's failure to tackle child sex abuse. She began her working life caring for children with disabilities and went on to run the charity Voice UK, which represents people with disabilities who have experienced crime or abuse. She was given an OBE in 2007. In her current post – and perhaps most relevantly, given Downing Street's interest in the Paterson case – Stone has found herself investigating the prime minister's personal finances. She found against him over a free holiday he took in Mustique courtesy of a Tory donor, because he ""did not make sufficient inquiries to establish the full facts about the funding arrangements for his free accommodation, either before his holiday, as he should have done, or in 2020"". However, Bryant's committee subsequently sought additional information from the prime minister and the donor in question, the Carphone Warehouse founder, David Ross, and concluded Johnson had correctly declared the luxury stay. Johnson is known to have been irked by the investigation into the funding of his 2019 Christmas holiday, which was one of a series into his financial affairs; they included one by the new ministerial standards watchdog, Lord Geidt, into the refurbishment of the Downing Street flat, an issue the Electoral Commission has subsequently been examining. Geidt's predecessor Sir Alex Allan resigned after the government disregarded his finding that the home secretary, Priti Patel, had breached the ministerial code over bullying allegations. Stone, who began the job in January 2018, is due to serve a five-year term.",Real Guardian,617.0
576,Real,The Guardian,"Nigel Farage's Brexit party may have saved up to 25 Labour seats in the Midlands and the north at the 2019 general election, denying Boris Johnson a landslide majority of 130, according to new analysis. Farage's party failed to win a single seat in December 2019 as Boris Johnson sought to hammer home the message that the Conservatives would ""get Brexit done"".  But elections experts John Curtice, Stephen Fisher and Patrick English say that by attracting Leave-supporting former Labour voters who might otherwise have backed the Conservatives, Farage may have significantly cut the scale of Labour's defeat. By modelling the behaviour of Labour Leavers elsewhere, they suggest that in the absence of a Brexit party candidate, 70% would likely have turned to the Tories and 30% stuck with Labour. Meanwhile, Conservative voters who switched to Farage's party were likely to have voted for Johnson. ""As a result, the Brexit party may have cost the Conservatives about 25 of the seats that Labour managed to retain – most of them Leave-voting seats in the north of England and the Midlands – and thereby enabled Labour to avoid an even heavier loss of seats,"" they say in a new book, The British General Election of 2019, published on Tuesday. Labour's performance was already its worst in terms of seats won since 1935, prompting Jeremy Corbyn's resignation after a chaotic campaign. The Brexit party stood its most prominent candidate, Richard Tice, in Labour-held Hartlepool where he took more than 10,000 votes but came in behind Labour and the Conservatives. The seat fell to the Tories in a byelection this year, raising questions about Keir Starmer's ability to win back the so-called red wall. Farage repeatedly sought an electoral pact with Johnson's Conservatives in 2019, offering to stand aside in Tory-held seats in exchange for a free run in former Labour heartlands constituencies. With no deal forthcoming, he unilaterally decided not to field candidates in seats where there was an incumbent Tory MP. This move had less of an effect on the UK-wide result, the authors say – but it did have an impact in a few key seats that the Tories only narrowly held. ""There was just a handful of seats where the decision of the Brexit party to stand down might have helped avoid a Conservative defeat, though they include the seats of two prominent Brexiters, Iain Duncan Smith (Chingford & Wood Green) and Dominic Raab (Esher & Walton)."" The Liberal Democrats are heavily targeting Raab's Surrey constituency, which he held by just 2,700 votes. Edited by academics Tim Bale, Robert Ford, Will Jennings and Paula Surridge, the new book is the latest edition of what is widely viewed as the definitive academic guide to general elections, with the first edition published in the wake of Labour's landslide victory in 1945. By analysing constituency-by-constituency results, and responses to the British Election Study internet panel, covering 30,000 voters, Curtice, Fisher and English show that Brexit heavily skewed the outcome in contests right across the country. ""The Conservatives' share of the vote increased by nearly six [percentage] points on 2017 in seats that are estimated to have backed Leave most heavily in 2016, while the party's vote fell by a couple of points in constituencies where most had voted Remain,"" they say. By contrast, they add: ""While Labour's vote fell by six points where most voters had backed Remain, it dropped by nearly nine points where a majority had supported Leave."" They say this pattern was ""disruptive of much of the existing geography of party support"" so that ""all of Britain's parties often recorded some of their best performances in relatively unfamiliar territory"" – including the Conservatives' advances in the North and Midlands.",Real Guardian,620.0
577,Real,The Guardian,"Last week's budget included a stealth cut to funding for youth services worth more than £400m over the next three years, Labour has claimed. In his budget speech last Wednesday, Rishi Sunak said: ""as we level up public services, we're also levelling up communities – restoring the pride people feel in the places they call home.  ""To do that, we're providing £560m for youth services, enough to fund up to 300 youth clubs across the country."" However, the Conservatives had already promised a £500m Youth Investment Fund in 2019; and the National Citizen Service, which provides young people with volunteering opportunities, has received an average of £178m over the past three years, according to Labour analysis. If the NCS continued to be funded at that level, and the £500m Youth Investment Fund was additional money, that would total more than £1bn over the next three years – almost twice Sunak's announced figure. Separately, analysis by the House of Commons library carried out for Labour shows that public spending on services for young people in England has been cut by two-thirds in real terms over the past 10 years. Shadow minister for young people, Cat Smith, said: ""with Conservative cuts year on year, it is no surprise we've seen a rise of anti-social behaviour alongside the huge challenge of violent crime and county lines. Youth services prevent serious youth violence that costs taxpayers and ruins young people's lives."" ""Given how much has been stripped away from youth services over the last decade by the Conservatives, this disguised cut from the government is likely to force many grassroots youth organisations to close."" As MPs continued to debate the budget in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Labour MPs accused Sunak of failing to make up for more than a decade of austerity – comparing his promise of new ""family hubs,"" to the more than 500 Sure Start centres scrapped since 2010, for example. A spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport conceded that the £560m promised by Sunak would include the cost of running the pre-existing NCS, which was set up by David Cameron. ""We are determined to give every child the best start in life and level up opportunity across the country,"" they said. ""Last week we announced plans to invest £560m to make sure youth services get the support they need. This includes funding the construction or refurbishment of up to 300 youth facilities in the most deprived areas of the country, and supporting the running of the NCS over the next three years."" The spokesperson also pointed to almost £5bn set aside for helping school pupils catch up with lost learning in the wake of the pandemic – though that is significantly less than was recommended by the government's own adviser on the issue, , who quit in protest. Sunak's third budget included a slew of spending promises, as the Conservatives seek to live up to their promise to ""level up"" neglected parts of the UK; but he also held out the prospect of tax cuts in the run-up to the next election.",Real Guardian,518.0
578,Real,The Guardian,"Rishi Sunak may see himself as a future prime minister but this budget confirmed he is very much Boris Johnson's chancellor. Rumours about ructions between the pair have gripped Westminster for months. Sunak, who told last year's Tory conference his party had a moral duty to fix the public finances, was known to be queasy about the government's national insurance increase, for example.  But ultimately Sunak was left with little choice. Johnson has long been sceptical about the idea of austerity and is keen to have something to show so-called red wall voters in exchange for their support in the 2019 general election. Fortuitously for both men, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) significantly upgraded its forecasts for the public finances, handing Sunak a helpful windfall, much of which he has chosen to spend almost immediately – £25bn in 2022-23 alone. So there was extra cash for schools, ""family hubs"", transport infrastructure and a string of other causes. But Sunak switched to a completely different register when he delivered the one passage of the budget in which he seemed truly himself – a tribute to Thatcher and cutting taxes, at the end of his hour-long address to parliament. Despite propelling the tax burden to its highest peacetime level – through a combination of next April's national insurance contributions (NICs) increase and a sharp rise in corporation tax due to take effect in 2023 – the chancellor painted himself as the champion of low taxes. More than that, he signalled he intended to cut taxes on ""work"" by the end of this parliament – an odd claim for someone who has just implemented a NICs rise. ""There's a reason we talk about the importance of family, community and personal responsibility. Not because these are an alternative to the market or the state … it's because they are more important than the market or the state,"" he said. ""As we look towards the future, I want to say this simple thing to the house and the British people: my goal is to reduce taxes. By the end of this parliament, I want taxes to be going down not up. I want this to be a society that rewards energy, ingenuity and inventiveness. A society that rewards work. That is what we believe on this side of the house. That is my mission."" This section of his speech was greeted with enthusiasm on the Conservative benches behind him. Despite welcoming a new bypass, hospital upgrade or museum refurb to put on the next election leaflet, many Tory MPs have niggling worries about where Johnson's cakeist instincts when it comes to public spending are taking their party. The Sunday Times reported just before the Tory conference in Manchester last month that Johnson and Sunak had struck a deal: the chancellor would sign off on some of the prime minister's spending priorities as long as he could maintain enough fiscal headroom to deliver tax cuts before the next general election. The reports were played down by both sides at the time but Wednesday's statement neatly fitted that narrative. Sunak dressed up the larger-than-expected cut in the taper for universal credit as a downpayment on his tax-cutting pledge – though it could perhaps more accurately be described as a partial U-turn on the widely criticised cut he insisted on. Meanwhile, it felt in the Commons on Wednesday as though Johnson was very much in the ascendancy. While he talked of an ""age of optimism"", Sunak cannot carry off boosterism as convincingly as his boss. And the OBR's forecasts told a very different story to the budget rhetoric when it came to the everyday lives of voters. Real disposable incomes are expected to take another three years to return to pre-pandemic levels, despite the prime minister's promise of a ""high-wage economy"". With a tough winter ahead, both Sunak and Johnson may have left themselves exposed to the public's sense that real life fails to match the sunny picture they have painted. And it remains to be seen whether Sunak's pre-election tax cut gameplan works out – what the OBR gives, it can take away. But for the time being, it feels as though Johnsonism – with its infrastructure spending and red wall handouts – is winning out over whatever Sunakism might turn out to be.",Real Guardian,720.0
579,Real,The Guardian,"Travellers to destinations including Australia, South Africa and Japan can expect to pay more to fly, as Rishi Sunak prepares to overhaul air passenger duty in next week's budget to reflect the environmental damage wrought by long-haul flights. The chancellor is keen to burnish his green credentials after a week in which he was accused of failing to back Boris Johnson's net-zero pledges with sufficient resources.  It is understood that he will announce that a reform of the tax, mooted earlier this year, will go ahead, with a higher rate levied on the longest journeys. Air passenger duty (APD) is paid by airlines, who tend to pass much of the costs on to their customers. It is currently charged in two bands, to destinations under 2,000 miles and above 2,000 miles, with business class passengers paying more. The maximum levied per passenger is currently due to rise to £554 next April. In a consultation document published alongside the March budget, the treasury set out several options for reforming APD. Its favoured approach was a new, three-band structure, with destinations more than 6,000 miles away facing the highest charge. There is also expected to be a new, lower rate for domestic flights. Such a move is likely to be sold as encouraging levelling up and protecting the Union by fostering connectivity between the nations and regions – though it could be controversial where there are viable public transport alternatives such as train routes. Environmentalists are likely to reject reforms of APD as much too modest to have an effect on curbing the demand for polluting flights. The New Economics Foundation (NEF) thinktank has called instead for a frequent flyer levy that would see regular air passengers pay more for the second and subsequent flights they take in a year. NEF research shows that 15% of people take 70% of flights. Ministers published a ""jet zero"" strategy in the summer aimed at reducing emissions from air transport, but it is widely regarded as a more difficult challenge than cutting pollution from car travel or domestic energy. The government is keen to demonstrate that it has a coherent plan for hitting its decarbonisation targets, ahead of the critical Cop26 meeting opening next week in Glasgow. Sunak is expected to present his budget as rebuilding the economy and boosting its resilience after the tough pandemic period – but he is also likely to acknowledge challenging headwinds, including volatile global energy prices and supply shortages. The chancellor has also made clear in recent weeks that he is concerned about the increasing risk of inflation, which the Bank of England's chief economist Huw Pill has suggested could top 5% in the coming months. That could see consumers facing what Labour has called a ""cost of living crisis"", with energy bills increasing, national insurance contributions set to rise in April and universal credit cut by £1,000 a year for millions of low-income families. Treasury sources denied reports of a VAT cut on domestic fuel bills to help families cope with the soaring costs of heating their homes, but the chancellor could opt for more targeted measures to cushion the blow for some households.",Real Guardian,527.0
580,Real,The Guardian,"Trade union leaders representing 3 million frontline workers have warned that the government risks ""another winter of chaos"" if urgent action is not taken to curb the spread of Covid, including mandatory mask-wearing in shops and on public transport. In a joint statement, unions including Usdaw, Unison, Unite, the GMB and Aslef attacked the government's ""laissez-faire approach to managing the pandemic"" after the prime minister insisted it was not yet time to impose fresh restrictions.  ""We all want to beat Covid once for all and to avoid further lockdowns. But without decisive action now, we risk sleepwalking into another winter of chaos,"" the union leaders said, in a joint statement also signed by the TUC general secretary, Frances O'Grady. The intervention from the unions came as: Sage said moving early to tackle rising Covid infections could help avoid harsher measures later on. Regional health chiefs broke with government policy to ask the public to wear masks and work from home. Official figures showed that one in 55 people in England had Covid-19 in the week ending 16 October, a level last seen in mid-January. The unions' members work in retail, transport, healthcare and other sectors where working from home is all but impossible. ""With hundreds of Covid outbreaks at workplaces being reported to health authorities each week, events feel ominously reminiscent of last winter,"" they said. ""The government must act now to reduce the spread of Covid. Failure to do so will risk public health, frontline services and the economy."" Their plea chimed with warnings in documents released by the Sage committee of experts, published on Friday, that early intervention is more effective than delayed action, as cases rise – though they stopped short of calling for immediate action. ""In the event of increasing case rates, earlier intervention would reduce the need for more stringent, disruptive and longer-lasting measures,"" minutes of a Sage meeting held on 14 October record. That echoed previous comments from the government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, that it should ""go hard and go early"" in curtailing the spread of the virus. Ministers said in September they would implement a ""plan B"", including the return of mandatory mask-wearing in public places and the reintroduction of working from home guidance, if the NHS risked coming under unsustainable pressure. New recorded infections dipped slightly to 49,298 on Friday. Over the past seven days, 947 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, up 16% on a week earlier. Boris Johnson, visiting a vaccine centre in London, said: ""The numbers that we're seeing at the moment are fully in line with what we expected in the autumn and winter plan."" He added that there was ""absolutely nothing to indicate"" that another lockdown might be necessary. The Sage documents suggested that working from home guidance could be the most effective element of the plan. According to a document from the Sage subgroups Spi-M, Spi-B and the EMG, ""reintroduction of working from home guidance, for those who can, may have the largest impact on transmission out of the potential plan B measures"". While the government is insistent that the pressures faced by the NHS are sustainable, at local level, a growing number of directors of public health (DPH) have begun urging local people to take steps including wearing masks and working from home. The Guardian has learned of at least a dozen areas where this is the case. Alice Wiseman, the DPH for Gateshead, said: ""Given the concerning rise in case numbers and the considerable pressures that we're already seeing on NHS services, now is the time for us all to do whatever we can to avoid reaching crisis point. Taking basic precautions now, like wearing face masks, working from home where possible and keeping indoor spaces well ventilated, could help us to avoid returning to more disruptive restrictions. ""So although mandatory measures are not yet being introduced, I'd urge all of our communities to pull together and take these simple but effective steps now."" The health secretary, Sajid Javid, reminded the public earlier this week of guidance recommending mask-wearing in crowded indoor spaces, but ministers have continued to insist that it remains a matter of personal choice, and Conservative MPs at Westminster rarely wear them. As well as mandatory mask-wearing, the union leaders' statement called for employers to be reminded of their duty to carry out workplace risk assessments to show how they are avoiding the spread of Covid; and for enhanced statutory sick pay to prevent people being forced back to work because they cannot afford to self-isolate. Their plea comes after the NHS Confederation and British Medical Association (BMA) sounded the alarm on behalf of NHS leaders and doctors earlier this week about the challenges facing the health service. Both bodies urged the government to implement ""plan B"" immediately. As well as mask-wearing and working from home, plan B includes introducing vaccine passports for venues such as nightclubs – a policy that would require a vote in parliament, and is deeply unpopular with Tory MPs. Labour has not yet called for plan B to be triggered – though it was against the ending of mandatory mask-wearing in the summer.",Real Guardian,865.0
581,Real,The Guardian,"Conservative peers will launch a last-ditch attempt to force the government to reverse the £20 a week universal credit cut on the eve of Rishi Sunak's budget next week. Philippa Stroud will table an amendment to the social security uprating bill in the House of Lords, with the support of Tory colleagues including the former work and pensions secretary David Willetts.  Constitutional precedent means it is usually considered unacceptable for the Lords to try to interfere in the financial aspects of legislation passed by the House of Commons. But Lady Stroud – a close ally of the MP Iain Duncan Smith, who devised the universal credit system – is keen to highlight the scale of concern in the Conservative party about the cut, which has already come into force. ""I do not take lightly the idea of disagreeing so fervently with my Conservative government, or of breaking with parliamentary convention. But this cut is a grave misstep and risks undermining the levelling up agenda, leaving behind society's most vulnerable people and putting at risk the stability of many homes up and down the country as we enter an unpredictable winter,"" she said. As well as Willetts, she is understood to have the backing of other Conservative peers including David Cameron's former aide Gabby Bertin. It is understood Lords clerks have warned Stroud they believe the amendment is out of the scope of the bill – but she still hopes to push it to a vote. One seasoned Lords watcher said it had perhaps a one in five chance of reaching a vote. Stroud's supporters point to a 2013 Lords vote on a boundary review that could have handed Cameron's Conservatives 20 extra seats. The clerks objected on that occasion but peers voted nevertheless, delaying the review for five years and infuriating Cameron's government. However, that issue did not have direct financial implications. Liberal Democrat peers are supporting Stroud's manoeuvre. Barbara Janke, the party's work and pensions spokesperson in the Lords, said: ""This cut hurts both those in and out of work, and risks pushing millions of families into deeper poverty. It's encouraging to see that now even loyal Conservatives are taking a stand and opposing this decision. ""The Liberal Democrats want to see the £20 uplift retained and will be backing Baroness Stroud's amendment, which we hope will receive cross-party support."" Removing the £20 a week increase in universal credit that was introduced in the early days of the Covid pandemic amounted to the largest overnight benefits cut in history, according to the Resolution Foundation thinktank. In his party conference speech earlier this month, Sunak said: ""Picture this: you're a young family. You work hard, saving a bit each month. But it's tough. You have ambitions for your careers for your children. You want to give them the best – more than you had. Now you tell me: is the answer to their hopes and dreams just to increase their benefits?"" Labour has tabled a separate amendment to the bill – more likely to come to a vote – that would force the government to set out the impact of the cuts on pensioner poverty in six months' time.",Real Guardian,530.0
582,Real,The Guardian,"More than 20 months into the Covid pandemic and with a tough winter looming, the public could be excused for having a distinct sense of deja vu. Infection rates are rising sharply, scientists and senior NHS figures are sounding the alarm – but the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, was touring the broadcast studios on Wednesday morning ruling out a lockdown in England and telling people ""absolutely"" to book their Christmas parties.  Sajid Javid's tone in his Downing Street press conference hours later was considerably more sombre but the substance of his message was the same: for now, it is business as usual. Unlike last autumn, when Sage scientists were unsuccessfully pressuring Boris Johnson to order a ""circuit-breaker"" lockdown, the government has at least set out a clear plan B. Last month's autumn and winter plan included returning to compulsory mask wearing, introducing vaccine passports for mass events and venues such as nightclubs, and reimposing guidance to work from home. But having a plan does not mean No 10 is any keener to act. Boris Johnson's ingrained reluctance to curtail the public's freedoms – even by compelling them to wear a mask – is well known. His former adviser Dominic Cummings attested in hearings before the health committee earlier this year that Johnson was even unconvinced the first lockdown, in March last year, had worked. Johnson is also temperamentally opposed to working from home – he used his party conference speech to say that ""we will and must see people back in the office"". And as at earlier stages of the virus, the prime minister's personal reluctance is bolstered by the political stance of many of his backbenchers. The Covid Recovery Group (CRG), chaired by the former Tory chief whip Mark Harper, are vehemently opposed to vaccine passports in the form proposed by the government – with only full vaccination, not test results, accepted. Javid confirmed earlier this week that MPs would be given a vote on the proposal before it is enacted – but the CRG believe that without Labour support it would be unlikely to pass. So implementing the government's plan B, even in the face of rising death rates, could be hampered both by political squeamishness at the top of government and a rebellion on the backbenches. And there is also a sense in government that being bold about reopening worked – something they will be reluctant to reverse. Johnson and Javid took a conscious gamble in the summer to press ahead with a ""big bang"" lifting of restrictions for England in July, which was condemned at the time by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, as ""reckless"". Despite the UK's position as the outlier among western European countries in terms of infections, ministers believe hindsight has shown that to be the right decision, allowing the public to get back to some semblance of normal life. Johnson's spokesperson frequently boasts that the UK has ""one of the most open economies"". Javid, too, has very different instincts from his predecessor Matt Hancock, who tended to advocate a precautionary approach. A fan of the libertarian author Ayn Rand, Javid said in July that he would not wear a mask in a quiet train carriage, even if asked to. All these factors – political and personal – help explain why for the time being, the focus is on ramping up the government's plan A. That means tackling the shortcomings of the vaccine booster programme; increasing the number of 12- to 15-year-olds getting the jab by allowing their parents to book appointments directly; and reminding the public not to ""tear the pants out of it"", as England's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, has repeatedly put it. The winter plan document included advice to the public to meet outdoors if possible, keep windows open and wear masks in crowded spaces. Javid reiterated that advice on Wednesday in the hope of influencing public behaviour – though Tory MPs were packed maskless on the green benches of the House of Commons just hours earlier for prime minister's questions. There are also hopes in government that next week's half-term break for schools will act as a mini firebreak, helping to stabilise infections, as social interaction between unvaccinated pupils is reduced. If a dip in the growth rate of the pandemic fails to materialise, however, the government may yet find itself – as so many times during this long pandemic – mugged by reality. The government's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, was notably absent from the press conference but it was hard not to recall his advice from a month ago about how to tackle a sharp rise in cases – ""go hard, and go early"".",Real Guardian,780.0
583,Real,The Guardian,"Less than a third of the UK public would support a trade deal with Saudi Arabia, data published by the government has revealed as the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, meets senior figures in the oil-rich state. Truss is on a trip to the Gulf, where a government spokesperson said she would discuss ""Afghanistan, regional security, climate change and trade"".  But a survey carried out by the Department for International Trade (DIT) earlier this year showed just 27% of the public would support a trade deal with the country. That compared with 64% for both Australia and New Zealand, for example, and 57% for the US. Riyadh's human rights record – including alleged state involvement in the murder of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi – has been back in the spotlight in the UK in recent weeks after the Saudi takeover of Newcastle United Football Club. Truss, who is now foreign secretary, has made clear she wants trade and security to be more closely aligned. The UK ran a £4.2bn trade deficit with Saudi Arabia in the three months to August, according to the latest official figures. The DIT had been quietly testing public opinion on trade deals with several countries, including Saudi Arabia, but was forced to publish the data after pressure from Labour. The shadow international trade secretary, Emily Thornberry, wrote to the polling company BMG after Truss said in a recent speech that 70% of the public supported the government's trade deals. Truss said: ""Our best way forward is free trade and free enterprise. And I'm pleased to say that people across Britain increasingly agree. Two-thirds of those surveyed last year supported free trade. Our most recent survey taken this year shows that support has risen. It has hit 70% of the public supporting free trade."" Thornberry pointed out that the rules of the British Polling Council, which oversees political research, mean that ministers are not meant to pluck a single figure from a survey without publishing the whole thing. After consultation with BMG, the DIT published the full survey last week on its website. Thornberry said: ""Thanks to Liz Truss's latest blunder, we now know that the public support she was claiming for her trade deals is nothing of the sort. ""The government simply does not have a mandate to take these actions on the country's behalf without properly consulting the public about what each agreement means, and who we're doing [it] with."" The survey was the fourth time the DIT had tested public opinion on trade policy, but the first time a question on Saudi Arabia was included. The other additional countries included were Brazil and the UAE. Truss is also visiting the UAE on her trip to the Gulf. The DIT said: ""It is standard practice for the government to survey ongoing public attitudes towards future free trade agreements. ""The UK encourages all states, including in the Middle East, to uphold international human rights obligations – where the UK has cause for concern we raise it at official and ministerial level.""",Real Guardian,508.0
584,Real,The Guardian,"With less than a fortnight to go before Rishi Sunak's budget, the message from the Treasury is, ""don't expect fireworks"". There have been pyrotechnics aplenty offstage, however, as the chancellor tries to hold the line against big-spending colleagues – not least the prime minister himself. After a spat with Kwasi Kwarteng burst into the open last weekend over backing for businesses hit by the energy crisis, with a Treasury source effectively accusing the business secretary of lying, Boris Johnson weighed in on Kwarteng's side from his Marbella bolthole.  While this was an unusually public row – and remains unresolved, with Treasury officials still casting a sceptical eye over bailout plans – senior Tories say it reflects continuing tension between Sunak and Johnson. While Johnson tends to look to solve short-term political problems by splashing the cash, colleagues say Sunak sees himself as the guardian of the public purse – and has become increasingly concerned about the risks of inflation. ""Boris is fundamentally totally a political animal – that's just what he is. Rishi is very diligent, incredibly hard-working, and he takes his role very, very seriously; and he looks at the current conditions, and he knows there are going to be difficult choices to make,"" said one senior Conservative who knows both men well. ""There's a frustration from him [Sunak] and more broadly in the Treasury that the rest of the cabinet have more of a 'just keep spending and borrowing' attitude, and he knows that is not sustainable."" Colleagues say the two men get on well – one described their relationship as a ""tag team"". But there are two overlapping factors driving tensions between them: different economic priorities and a different political endgame. While Johnson repeatedly highlighted his desire to create a ""high-wage, high-skill economy"" at the Conservatives' conference, Sunak has pointed to the risks of inflation if wage rises run ahead of productivity as the economy recovers. Allies are clear that he sees higher wages as the outcome of decisions to invest more in skills and technology, not a quick fix. ""I think what the prime minister was doing was stating an ambition and a vision – and sometimes in order to get the vision across it has to be very simple,"" said one. And while Sunak willingly signed off on unprecedented spending during the pandemic, including the extraordinary furlough scheme, which saw the state paying millions of workers' wages, he has made clear he now wants the government to restore financial discipline. He is a fiscal conservative not just because that is the chancellor's role and his own political gut instinct, but also because that is what the Conservative party base wants to see and hear. Few at Westminster doubt that the multimillionaire former hedge fund manager came into politics with the hope of being prime minister. His personal brand is carefully burnished by a special adviser, Cass Horowitz, who helps with his slick social media output, including a recent video with a dramatic orchestral soundtrack hailing the success of the furlough scheme. Yet Sunak's popularity among the Tory grassroots has recently been eclipsed by that of the new foreign secretary, Liz Truss, whom some believe Johnson deliberately promoted as a rival. The chancellor slipped from second place to fifth in the latest monthly poll by the website ConservativeHome of Conservative members – who will ultimately decide who succeeds Johnson. That still put him a full 21 places ahead of the prime minister, but the slide could reflect Sunak's role in signing off the increase in national insurance contributions announced last month. Certainly he felt the need to stress at the party's conference, among grumbles from members and MPs, that he still believed in low taxes – but not before insisting the public finances must be put on a sustainable footing. The backbencher Steve Baker complained at the time the government was, ""grinding miserably forward, doing Ed Miliband's Labour policies. We're hating every minute and trying to claim it's Conservatism."" At September's Downing Street press conference to announce the historic national insurance contributions rise, Sunak's body language was markedly less comfortable than that of Johnson and the health secretary, Sajid Javid. Allies later confirmed that he would have preferred not to be increasing taxes at all but as Johnson's chancellor, was yoked to the prime minister's personal promise of ""fixing"" social care. On other recent spending decisions, including overseas aid cuts and the £20-a-week reduction in universal credit, Sunak has asserted himself, in the face of profound concerns among colleagues at the consequences of his tough approach. But he was evidently irked by Kwarteng's plea for more cash for crisis-struck firms, and government insiders say he is also resisting a fresh splurge on preparing the UK for the transition to net zero, before the Cop26 summit. Some are beginning to wonder how many times Sunak will be able to stomach being hauled towards more spending by Johnson, who is overwhelmingly focused on winning re-election, whatever the fiscal cost. The prime minister reportedly mused about moving Sunak aside after the pair clashed back in the summer.",Real Guardian,848.0
585,Real,The Guardian,"The killing of David Amess on Friday has intensified concerns about MPs' safety as they go about their work. These are some of the issues that will be considered as their security is reviewed:  Security at Westminster, where MPs spend part of their week, is visibly tight, with armed police patrolling the parliamentary estate, and security passes required to cross the perimeter. A knife-wielding attacker nevertheless managed to get into the grounds at Westminster in March 2017 and fatally stab PC Keith Palmer before being shot dead. When MPs are back in their constituencies up and down the UK, security is – perhaps inevitably – more lax. A plan called Operation Bridger, involving the police and parliamentary authorities, was put into place in December 2015 after the fraught parliamentary debate on bombing Syria saw an upsurge in concern about threats of violence. It allows for what ministers at the time called ""advice and guidance regarding members' security and a process to access funding for standardised security measures"". MPs have a single point of contact at their local police force to provide advice, and many have had measures implemented such as panic buttons, bomb-proof letterboxes and toughened glass – particularly in the wake of the murder of Jo Cox in June 2016. In part, it goes with the job: many MPs have said since Friday's tragic events that they relish the face-to-face meetings with voters that take place at advice surgeries and other local events, and consider it to be a crucial part of their role. As the Speaker of the House of Commons, Lindsay Hoyle, wrote in the Observer, ""the very essence of being an MP is to help and be seen by our constituents. They are the people who elected us to represent them, so surely making ourselves available to them is the cornerstone of our democracy?"" The home secretary, Priti Patel, suggested on Sunday that there are some steps MPs can take to make these events safer, such as booking appointments and endeavouring to check who they are meeting beforehand; checking the venue they are attending; and ensuring they are not alone. However, the shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, pointed out that for MPs with large rural constituencies, it will be hard to confine their surgeries to premises where security measures can be put in place, without leaving many constituents out of reach. Patel and Hoyle have both said security for MPs will be looked at following Friday's events – and the home secretary has said the review will take place urgently. Most MPs have already been contacted by their local police force to check up on their security concerns. Patel said the next stage of the review would look at a wide range of potential measures, including the possibility of police protection at MPs' surgeries, and even airport-style scanners at the door, though it is unclear how that would work in venues such as the church where Amess was meeting constituents on Friday. Some MPs have already been offered police support when carrying out engagements. The Conservative backbencher Harriet Baldwin told the BBC on Sunday that a patrol car had parked outside her constituency surgery on Friday, when it was unclear whether Amess's killing was part of a wider attack. Another backbench Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, who tried and failed to revive Palmer when he was stabbed in Westminster four years ago, suggested there should be a ""pause"" in face-to-face meetings while the security review is carried out.",Real Guardian,582.0
586,Real,The Guardian,"The shadow justice secretary, David Lammy, has urged Dominic Raab to tackle the ""chaos"" in the justice system before unpicking human rights law, after Raab said he wanted to curb the power of the European court of human rights (ECHR) over the government. Raab used an interview with the Sunday Telegraph to signal that he would be reviewing the Human Rights Act, which brought the European convention on human rights into UK law, with a view to constraining the influence of the Strasbourg court.  But Lammy said that was the wrong priority. ""Rape convictions are at historic lows and women are rapidly losing faith in the criminal justice system, while record backlogs have left the courts at breaking point. And yet the priority for Dominic Raab seems to be undermining vital human rights legislation that protects us all,"" he said. ""Instead of trying to weaken the rule of law, the Tories need to set out how they plan to fix the chaos they have created in the justice system."" Raab's predecessor, Robert Buckland, said in a letter to the prime minister after he was sacked that the justice system had undergone ""years of underfunding"". In his interview, Raab laid out plans to limit the powers of the ECHR in the UK, by allowing the government to legislate to ""correct"" judgments ministers believe are wrong. A long-term sceptic about the Human Rights Act, which brought the rights convention into UK law, he was handed the justice post in Boris Johnson's September reshuffle. ""I don't think it's the job of the European court in Strasbourg to be dictating things to, whether it's the NHS, whether it's our welfare provision, or whether it's our police forces,"" he said. ""We're identifying the problems and we're making sure we fix them … We will get into the habit of legislating on a more periodic basis and thinking about the mechanism for that. Where there have been judgments that, albeit properly and duly delivered by the courts, we think are wrong, the right thing is for parliament to legislate to correct them."" Proposals are expected to be published before the end of the year. Raab also said he was looking again at how the process of judicial review works – something Buckland examined before being sacked by Johnson last month. Raab expressed concern that judicial review was being used to ""harpoon"" infrastructure projects – such as the long-awaited tunnelling of the A303 near Stonehenge, permission for which was overturned by the high court in July. The process of judicial review caused fury inside government when Johnson's prorogation of parliament in 2019 was struck down by the supreme court. Wera Hobhouse, the LibDem justice spokesperson, said, ""This move to weaken people's opportunity to challenge this government, or any future government, because sometimes the courts rule against them, weakens our democracy to the core. Governments make mistakes and to be able to hold them to account as a citizen is fundamental."" The home secretary, Priti Patel, has complained about ""activist lawyers"" interfering in immigration cases. Raab suggested he would look to limit appeals against immigration tribunal rulings, which he said have a success rate of 3%. ""We know we've got a very litigious culture, I'm a recovering lawyer myself, and we quite rightly have judicial checks on the executive,"" he said. ""But it's got to be done in a constructive and sensible way which allows the government to deliver the projects that it's tasked and mandated by parliament to do [and ensures that] taxpayers' money is not being squandered because projects are being harpooned.""",Real Guardian,597.0
587,Real,The Guardian,"Rishi Sunak is set to confirm that the ""pause"" on public sector pay that affected 2.6 million teachers, police and civil servants will be lifted in April, as the economy bounces back from Covid. The chancellor imposed the freeze last November and it came into force in April. At the time, he said it was unfair for public sector workers to get a rise while many of their private sector counterparts were being furloughed or losing their jobs.  With wages in many sectors rising, and the prime minister using his party conference speech to highlight the prospects for a ""high-wage economy"", Treasury sources said that argument no longer applied. However, each Whitehall department will have to fund any pay increases from within its own budget, and TUC analysis shows that the pay of many public sector workers has fallen significantly in real terms after years of tight settlements. The TUC general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said: ""In the face of a looming cost-of-living crisis, the government must increase departmental budgets so that every public sector worker gets a meaningful, real-terms pay increase. If ministers don't give departments the funding to raise pay, they are not ending the public sector pay freeze."" Recent polling carried out for the TUC by YouGov found 27% of public sector workers said the government's pay policy had made them more likely to quit. NHS staff and public servants earning less than £24,000 were exempted from the pay freeze, but it covered 2.6 million other public sector workers, including teachers, firefighters, the armed forces and police. Sunak will set out the funding for each individual department as part of a three-year spending review, which he will deliver alongside the budget on 27 October. The defence minister Tobias Ellwood has already said he hopes the armed forces will be given a pay increase of ""more than 1%"" from April. Local government workers have been offered 1.75%, well below the rate of inflation, which has been rejected by unions. A government spokesperson said: ""We recognise the incredible work that public sector workers have continued to do throughout the pandemic, and the challenges many of them have faced as key workers."" Sunak is also expected to announce April's increase in the ""national living wage"" (NLW), after the low pay commission has produced its final report in the coming days. The commission advises the government on how to reach the target set by George Osborne of lifting the NLW to two-thirds of median earnings by 2024. In March, it suggested £9.42 as the rate likely to be necessary, based on wage forecasts at the time – but since then pay has been growing robustly, and some experts believe a higher figure is likely. The current rate is £8.91. Johnson seized on the promise of a higher wage post-Brexit economy earlier this month as petrol shortages afflicted forecourts and businesses in sectors including hospitality and retail complained of difficulties recruiting staff. However, Sunak has made clear he is concerned about the risk of inflation getting out of control if wages rise without improvements in productivity – from better skills and investment in new technologies, for example. ""That is something that we've discussed in this country together and have collectively decided that's not the right model going forward,"" he told reporters during International Monetary Fund (IMF) meetings in Washington this week. ""We want to move to a higher-wage, higher-skilled economy. Now obviously that will take time, and we would want to make sure that is accompanied by increases in productivity, so it's not inflationary."" A Treasury source said Sunak was concerned about the risks of rising inflation, which could lead the Bank of England to increase interest rates and potentially push up the cost of servicing the government's debt. ""It's something that he has had his eye on for a long time now,"" the source said. UK inflation measured on the consumer prices index was 3% in August, up from 1% in March.",Real Guardian,661.0
588,Real,The Guardian,"Staff at the DVLA have been promised payments worth £735 as the government seeks to avoid strike action that risks exacerbating the backlog of tens of thousands of licences awaiting renewal. It is understood the money will come in two payments, and has been offered as though unrelated to the fact the PCS trade union is currently balloting staff over renewed strike action.  DVLA employees have been locked in a bitter dispute with management for months over the safety of employees asked to work through the pandemic in the agency's Swansea headquarters, where the PCS says there have been more than 900 Covid cases. Transport secretary Grant Shapps has been under pressure to resolve the dispute, with the availability of licences for HGV drivers regarded as critical to tackling the supply crunch that has seen retailers warn about empty shelves at Christmas. The DVLA said last week that it had 54,000 HGV licences awaiting processing – many of them renewals. An agreement on safety and the return to the workplace was reached in June with the management of the DVLA, but the PCS claims it was unpicked at the last minute. Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the PCS, told the Guardian his members had been unfairly blamed for the DVLA's failure to draw up plans to deal with the backlog of licences awaiting renewal. ""Deflecting on to the civil service or the union is an easy out for them,"" he said, adding, ""it is in crisis down there – and in any other organisation you would have expected them to want to find a resolution when there was one there."" Turnout in the PCS's last ballot of staff earlier this year was only just over the 50% legal threshold for triggering industrial action. If the PCS wins this time it plans to hold further stoppages over safety, despite the £735 payments. Meanwhile more than a thousand driving examiners are to strike for two days next week at another Department for Transport agency, the DVSA, over workloads. Examiners, about 200 of whom also test HGV drivers, have been asked to carry out eight tests a day instead of the current seven – something the PCS claims is unsafe and would lead to burnout. The roads minister, Charlotte Vere, visited the DVLA on Thursday and met staff. Shapps recently announced that the army would be drafted in to boost the DVSA's capacity to offer HGV tests but the organisation has not been given other additional resources to resolve the post-Covid backlog. Serwotka said: ""The two organisations have one common denominator, which is that they're both in the Department for Transport – and the Department for Transport is really poorly managed and has a very poor record of industrial relations."" He added that the prime minister's rhetoric in his party conference speech about a high wage, high investment economy did not appear to apply to workers such as those in the DVLA and DVSA. ""It seems that whoever else they say they have in mind, they certainly don't mean people on the frontline of the pandemic,"" he said. A DVLA spokesperson said the payments to staff were ""local recognition awards … [that] form part of a civil service-wide recognition scheme and are in no way linked to the industrial action"".",Real Guardian,548.0
589,Real,The Guardian,"Two ""red wall"" Tory groups representing more than 100 MPs have joinedforces to campaign for a cut to business rates in the budget later this month, warning that failure to act will risk the party losing a string of northern seats at the next election. With many high streets across the UK scarred by shuttered shops, Jake Berry, chair of the Northern Research Group (NRG) of MPs, pointed to new research suggesting the public support cutting business rates to support their local retailers.  His call was joined by Esther McVey, the former work and pensions secretary and chair of another backbench pressure group, the Blue Collar Conservatives, who said cutting business rates was vital to the prime minister's ""levelling up"" agenda. McVey, who represents George Osborne's former seat of Tatton, said: ""The burden of tax on bricks-and-mortar retail is too high, and the best single policy to revive our high streets would be to cut business rates. Levelling up must include ensuring taxes come down."" Together, the Northern Research Group and Blue Collar Conservatives represent more than 100 Tory MPs – almost a third of the parliamentary party. A survey of 1,598 adults by Deltapoll found that 66% supported a tax cut for shops, increasing to 74% among voters in seats won by the Conservatives at the 2019 election. ""The public are clear: the burden of tax on bricks-and-mortar retail is too high. Without a cut in business rates at the budget we risk losing support in our most marginal seats, including in the North and the Midlands,"" said Berry. ""Cutting rates would be a huge boost to our local communities and would show quick delivery of the central mission of this government: levelling up."" Rishi Sunak was due to announce the results of an overhaul of business rates in his March budget, but delayed it as he extended crisis measures to deal with the pandemic. Details are now expected to be announced in the budget on 27 October. Smaller businesses including shops were granted an extended business rates holiday through the Covid crisis, but that came to an end last month. Business rates, which were introduced in 1990, are based on the property value of a firm's premises. Industry groups complain that the system unfairly penalises companies with bricks-and-mortar outlets against online retailers. The British Retail Consortium has claimed four out of five retailers will have to close branches if the burden of business rates is not alleviated. Recent research by the consultancy WPI Strategy suggested the seats where business rates represent the highest share of businesses' profits include the Conservative-held marginals Leigh, Redcar and Hartlepool. Berry, the former Northern powerhouse minister, was a backer of Johnson's leadership bid but has recently become increasingly critical of government policy, including on the £20-a-week universal credit cut and the planned national insurance rise. Backbench groups including the NRG and Blue Collar Conservatives have become more vocal in recent months, underlining the changed makeup of the parliamentary Tory party since the 2019 general election. In his reshuffle last month, Johnson handed the new levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, the task of ensuring that voters in many of the seats the party won for the first time can see some progress by the time of the next poll, which must take place before December 2025 but could come much earlier. The renamed Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities is expected to publish a white paper in the next few weeks setting out its approach. Labour recently promised to scrap business rates altogether, saying it would replace them with a fairer system.",Real Guardian,600.0
590,Real,The Guardian,"Rishi Sunak's frustration with Kwasi Kwarteng may only have burst into the open on Sunday because of an ill-tempered outburst from a Treasury insider, but the row over support for businesses hit by the energy crisis laid bare deeper tensions at the top of government. Sunak spent much of the pandemic playing up to his role as the people's chancellor, as the state stepped in to pay the wages of millions of people through the successful but extraordinarily costly furlough scheme.  With the economy bouncing back more quickly than expected from the Covid slump, however, Sunak is keen to return to the Treasury orthodoxy of fixing the public finances and letting the private sector shift for itself. He would also dearly like to be able to cut taxes in the run-up to the next general election – both to tempt voters to stick with the Tories; but also to play to Conservative members mulling the best candidate to succeed Boris Johnson as prime minister. Sunak was dragged by Johnson and Sajid Javid into announcing the national insurance increase to fund the NHS and social care at a time when allies said he would prefer not to be raising taxes at all, but appears to have drawn a line in the sand when it comes to other spending. The Treasury steamrollered through the £20 a week universal credit cut in the face of widespread warnings that it would drive families into poverty, and insisted on cutting the aid budget despite opposition from many senior Tories who warned that it would cost lives. Whitehall insiders suggest Sunak is equally keen to cleave to Treasury orthodoxy when it comes to intervention in the private sector. He signed off on the bailout for CF Fertilisers last month, justifying it as a short-term solution to an evident market failure. But the Treasury has long been sceptical about being drawn into pouring taxpayers' money into potentially open-ended bailouts for struggling companies. With sky-high energy prices expected to last for months, Sunak is likely to be highly reluctant to put public money on the table. It is hardly surprising, then, that he has become increasingly irked with Kwarteng, who appears to have been signalling to desperate business groups that he would love to help them but is hamstrung by the parsimonious Treasury. There is also annoyance at Kwarteng claiming credit for the government's latest narrative to explain away the shortages plaguing supermarkets and petrol station forecourts. The prime minister repeatedly insisted at his party's conference in Manchester last month that these were caused by a long overdue adjustment to a post-Brexit, high-wage economy. Kwarteng has told colleagues he believes he is responsible for this idea, which he dramatises by telling the story of encountering a builder in his constituency during the 2016 referendum campaign who felt his business had been undermined by cheap migrant labour. Sunak's emphasis in his conference speech was somewhat different, focusing on the importance of investment in technology to boost productivity rather than the suggestion employers must immediately ratchet up wages. Generations of Treasury officials have regarded their colleagues in the business department as having a tendency to go native, in effect becoming industry lobbyists. Which side wins out in this particular battle – Sunak or Kwarteng – depends on which of them the prime minister decides to back. Johnson has had his own run-ins with his assertive chancellor in recent months, with the pair clashing during the summer about Covid travel rules, which Sunak urged Johnson to relax in a conveniently leaked letter. The prime minister then reportedly mused to friends about whether it was time for Sunak to be removed from his post. Johnson tends to be considerably more relaxed about splurging public money than his chancellor. He is also very focused on retaining the ""red wall seats"" he won in 2019, some of which play host to energy-intensive industries such as steelworks. With his mind focused – even in sunny Marbella – by a string of negative front pages about the risks of the energy crisis, Whitehall officials believe it is increasingly likely he will wade in on Kwarteng's side.",Real Guardian,691.0
591,Real,The Guardian,"Keir Starmer has blamed the fuel crisis on Boris Johnson's ""whack-a-mole"" approach to running the country, urging him to plan ahead or risk staff shortages in a string of other industries in the coming months. Ministers have suspended competition law in the energy sector and called in the army in recent days as they scramble to alleviate the shortages on forecourts caused by a lack of HGV drivers.  Other sectors including social care, hospitality and food production have also highlighted difficulties in finding staff as a result of Brexit and the Covid pandemic, and the CBI said this month the problems could persist for up to two years. Starmer said: ""The government at the moment is playing whack-a-mole: it's trying to whack down one problem and another one pops up somewhere else. And that is a pathetic, lamentable lack of planning."" He said a Labour government would ""plan across the board with the different sectors"". Starmer's party voted for Johnson's Brexit deal last Christmas, saying it did not want to risk a no-deal exit, but the Labour leader has accused the prime minister of failing to ""make Brexit work"". Labour believes the spectacle of empty shelves and shuttered petrol stations sends voters a powerful message about the government's incompetence, though some of Starmer's colleagues felt he failed to intervene forcefully enough last weekend when the crisis was raging. Back in London after delivering a party conference speech that ridiculed Johnson as ""a trivial man"", Starmer said he believed the prime minister's appeal was ""wearing a bit thin"" with voters. ""People know the difference between a slogan and actually getting things done, and what they're not seeing is him getting things done,"" he said. ""They see a government that simply can't govern and can't plan, and of course that's going to wear thin. ""You've got that collection of failures, whether it's energy, fuel, empty shelves, people can't get to work because they haven't got the petrol, people aren't doing the journeys that they need to do."" Starmer said he believed his 90-minute conference speech, which pressed home the themes of ""work, care, inequality, security"", had helped to address critics' claims that he lacks political pizzazz. ""People did say the delivery was pretty good, so let me cast off some of the characteristics that are always piled on me,"" he said. Asked if he was deliberately unshowy, in contrast to Johnson whom he called ""a showman with nothing left to show,"" Starmer said: ""I'd like to think I put on a pretty good show yesterday."" However, he conceded that he hoped his serious approach contrasted with Johnson's. ""In the end, I think people want a degree of seriousness about the problems that we confront,"" he said. Labour's internal divisions were on display this week, not least during Starmer's speech when he was heckled repeatedly by a small number of party members. Despite accusations of abandoning the radical prospectus on which he won the leadership, Starmer insisted Labour was setting out radical policies that should give activists from across the party ""something to get behind"". He cited plans to put first-time buyers at the front of the queue for new-build homes; to ensure workers are granted full employment rights from day one; and the shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves's £28bn-a-year climate fund. ""If people who want to change our country for the better want something to get behind, we have put a bold set of policy proposals on the table on housing, employment, education and climate,"" he said. ""I would invite everybody to say 'there is now something we could do'."" Starmer has pushed through a series of changes to Labour's governance rules that he and his team hope will allow Labour MPs to focus more on the concerns of voters and less on disgruntled grassroots members. But it sparked a backlash, including from the Corbynite campaign group Momentum.",Real Guardian,646.0
592,Real,The Guardian,"Keir Starmer will on Wednesday repudiate the legacy of Jeremy Corbyn and accuse the government of being ""lost in the woods"" in a keenly awaited conference speech that will put addressing Britain's mental health crisis at the heart of his pitch to voters. In a sign of the significance the Labour leader puts on the issue, Starmer will promise a Labour government will make mental health treatment available to everyone who needs it within a month, and create drop-in mental health hubs aimed at children and young people.  The pledges will be set out in his first ""in-person"" address to his party's conference in Brighton which he hopes will show Labour is ""back in business,"" and has a programme for tackling ""the chronic problems revealed by Covid"". Labour believes the mounting fuel crisis is stoking voters' concerns about Boris Johnson's competence, with the government assailed on a number of fronts and even the Tory-leaning press accusing Downing Street of having lost its grip. ""The shine has come off,"" said a party spokesperson. After a conference marred by divisions over party rule changes and the resignation of left-winger Andy McDonald from the shadow cabinet, Starmer's speech will seek to present Labour as a government in waiting. Asked on Tuesday whether he would prioritise party unity or winning the general election, he told the BBC it would be ""winning"". Though Starmer is not expected to mention his predecessor by name, the tenor of the speech will be aimed at underlining the stark differences between the two men and their policies. A Labour source said: ""The speech will be a demonstration of the way the Labour party has changed. It will be a clear indication that Labour will never again go into an election with a manifesto that isn't a serious plan for government."" As Boris Johnson on Tuesday appealed to the public not to fill their cars with petrol unless necessary, Starmer will seek to contrast the government's chaotic approach with the scale of the challenges facing the country. He is expected to say: ""I see the government lost in the woods with two paths beckoning. One path leads back where we came from. None of the lessons of Covid are heeded. The divisions and flaws that were brutally exposed by the pandemic all worsen. ""But there is another path down which we address the chronic problems revealed by Covid with the kindness and the togetherness that got us through."" He will call mental health ""one of the urgent needs of our time,"" and promise that a Labour government will tackle it on a number of fronts. As well as setting a new NHS target guaranteeing treatment within a month, and creating ""hubs"" for young people, Starmer will pledge to recruit 8,500 new mental health staff and ensure every secondary school has a full-time mental health specialist. ""We'll make sure children and young people get early help, putting specialist support in every school and a mental health hub in every community,"" he will say. ""This is prevention in action. Helping young people, looking after their wellbeing."" Labour calculates the package of measures would cost £1bn a year by the end of the next parliament, allowing one million more people to be treated annually than the government is currently planning to help. It would fund the policies with two tax increases already announced – the charging of VAT on private school fees, and the closing of loopholes used by private equity investors. The Labour leader succeeded in pushing through a series of radical changes to Labour's internal rulebook on Sunday in the face of furious objections from the party's leftwingers. When McDonald resigned as shadow employment rights minister on Tuesday, he claimed Starmer had repudiated the ""10 principles"" on which he won the leadership, and exacerbated the party's divisions. McDonald abruptly stepped down on Tuesday, saying Starmer's office was asking him to reject union calls for a £15 an hour minimum wage, which he felt he could not do. Conference delegates backed a motion calling for the £15 minimum wage in Brighton on Tuesday, but Starmer said he did not agree with the policy. Speaking to ITV News in Brighton, the Labour leader said: ""I will vote of course in accordance with the policy that we unveiled on Saturday. We were very clear on Saturday that a £10 minimum wage, which is a 12% increase and means £2,000 in real money for those who would benefit under that, that is significant, that is our policy."" The Labour leader denied that he had been pleased about McDonald's resignation, after speculation that he had been keen to sack him in May's reshuffle. But some in the leader's team believe a confrontation with the left of his party will serve to convince the public Labour has changed. Starmer said he had spoken to his deputy, Angela Rayner, about the strong language she used at a party fringe meeting on Saturday evening, calling the Conservative government ""scum"". ""Angela Rayner and I have different approaches and different styles,"" he told SkyNews. Asked if they also had different opinions, he said: ""It's not language I would have used. Angela and I talk every day. Of course we have huge agreements and disagreements.""",Real Guardian,873.0
593,Real,The Guardian,"David Lammy, the shadow justice secretary, has defended Angela Rayner for calling the Tory government ""scum"", saying the Conservatives should get their house in order before criticising Labour for ""fruity"" language. Speaking to the Guardian in Brighton where he will address Labour's annual conference on Tuesday, Lammy attacked the government's apparent outrage over Rayner's comments at a late-night conference rally.  ""I too have been known for fruity remarks over the years. I'm not that keen to take lectures from senior Tories who have a leader who described people like me as being piccaninnies with watermelon smiles, who describes gay men as tank topped bumboys or Muslim women as bank robbers,"" he said. Rayner declined to apologise for telling activists on Saturday evening that ""we cannot get any worse than a bunch of scum, homophobic, racist, misogynistic, absolute vile … banana republic, vile, nasty, Etonian … piece of scum"". Transport secretary Grant Shapps described the comments as appalling. Labour leader Keir Starmer appeared uncomfortable when asked about the comments, saying he would not use that language himself. But Lammy said: ""I've heard a lot of noise from senior Conservatives. I think they should get their own house in order – and with so much going on, it's slightly absurd that people are rushing to focus on a form of words, when there is some serious substance to talk about."" Lammy is regarded as a strong performer in the House of Commons. He said he was keen to take on his new opposite number Dominic Raab, who was moved to become justice secretary in Boris Johnson's reshuffle, and is expected to take aim at the Human Rights Act. ""I relish the opportunity to go toe-to-toe with Dominic Raab in the coming weeks and months,"" he said. Raab is widely viewed at Westminster as more hardline on issues including human rights than his predecessor, Robert Buckland. ""I hope they're not seriously trying to abolish human rights, which I think is a huge cornerstone of the world order that was set up after the second world war,"" Lammy said. ""There is no clamour from the public to get rid of human rights: it's extraordinary."" In his speech on Tuesday, Lammy is set to announce that law firms will be prevented from taking on lucrative government contracts unless they are also doing some pro bono work (representing clients for free). ""The government is handing out huge procurement contracts – has been during the pandemic and certainly was during Brexit – and what we're saying is that there will be a requirement to do pro bono work to get those contracts,"" he said. He warned about the challenge of what he called ""advice deserts"" in which low-income people are left without any affordable local lawyers to consult. Lammy also criticised the government for failing to support the judiciary in recent months, with home secretary Priti Patel bemoaning the activities of ""activist lawyers"". ""It's been unsavoury and unbelievable to listen to people like PP disparaging lawyers: 'do-gooders,' 'activist lawyers'. This has been a very tough period,"" he said. After Labour delegates spent the weekend wrangling over complex rule changes aimed at making it harder for a far-left MP to win the leadership again, Lammy said it was time for the party to look outwards. ""We've won the argument, it's over, it's one day, we'll get on with conference,"" he said. ""I'm afraid we've been too good at navel-gazing, and having what should be private rows in public. It's time to bring the washing in from the line."" Lammy said Labour would act to repair the legal aid system, which has been hit by significant government cuts in recent years. ""When we talk about the welfare state, we talk about that safety net, that we're very proud of in this party having set up in that Attlee government, after 1945. A significant part of that was actually legal aid as well,"" he said. ""That concept of equity, and justice: that sense that whatever your background you can get justice. It's fallen away and we want to restore it.""",Real Guardian,681.0
594,Real,The Guardian,"After a rocky run-in to Labour's conference in Brighton, Keir Starmer was hoping Monday would be the moment his party set internal divisions aside and turned to face the voters. Chatting to journalists in the press room, he said his package of rule changes passed by delegates on Sunday would allow Labour MPs to focus on the public instead of looking over their shoulders at angry grassroots members.  He praised Rachel Reeves for her speech setting out her stall as Labour's next chancellor: radical but responsible. Little more than an hour later, however, the show of unity was shattered when Andy McDonald, the last remaining Corbynite on Labour's frontbench, abruptly resigned. McDonald, who had been shadow secretary of state for workers' rights, objected to being ordered by the leader's office to oppose a union demand for Labour to back a £15-an-hour minimum wage. In his resignation letter – distributed to journalists without warning and before he had spoken to Starmer – McDonald claimed the labour movement was ""more divided than ever"". Starmer's team regarded his departure as a deliberate attempt to detract from Reeves' speech and destabilise the leadership. It is understood that Angela Rayner, who has worked closely with McDonald on workers' rights, was not forewarned. Rayner's relationship with Starmer has come under close scrutiny after he distanced himself from her strongly worded remarks about Tory ""scum"" at the weekend, saying he would talk to her about them. The pair have broadly patched up their differences since Starmer stripped Rayner of the jobs of party chair and elections coordinator in May's reshuffle, but they have very different political and personal styles. Starmer's robust leadership style and tendency to take decisions with the advice of a tight inner circle can irk even close colleagues, some of whom were taken aback by his rule-change plan. Ed Miliband found his approach to energy nationalisation undercut on Sunday when Starmer said Labour would not take the big six energy companies into public ownership. That appeared to contradict recent remarks in which Miliband, the shadow energy secretary, had suggested public ownership was part of the solution to shifting the economy to green energy. Labour insiders said Miliband was frustrated by Starmer's flat ""no"" when asked about nationalisation, with one party source suggesting the two men were barely speaking – though Miliband denies this. While Starmer's team were clearly shocked by McDonald's resignation on Monday, they believe another row with the party's left – over rejecting radical demands from trade unions – will not do his public reputation any harm. However, there is also a fear that McDonald's determination to air his concerns in public marks a new, more militant phase for the party's left wing. The Corbynite campaign group Momentum responded to Starmer's rule change package last week by warning it would spark a ""civil war"", claiming ""conference will get very messy, very fast – and there is no saying who will come out on top"". The former shadow chancellor John McDonnell wrote on Sunday that he could no longer behave as an ""elder statesman"", and he has since begun criticising Starmer more directly, even suggesting that the Labour leader should consider his position if he has not improved the party's poll ratings by January. Jeremy Corbyn's outriders believe they faced a deliberate programme of sabotage from centrist MPs in the parliamentary Labour party, and after Starmer took them on so publicly over leadership rules they now feel the gloves are off. They may not have the 40 MPs necessary to muster a leadership challenge, but they may become increasingly noisy in the coming months just as Starmer hopes to show the public the Labour party is a government in waiting.",Real Guardian,618.0
595,Real,The Guardian,"Labour's energy policy has been become mired in confusion after Keir Starmer blindsided shadow business secretary Ed Miliband by ruling out nationalising the big six energy companies. It is understood Miliband was frustrated by Starmer's comments, as he had been keen to keep open the option of nationalising parts of the energy sector to aid the economy's transition to net zero.  Appearing on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, hours before Labour delegates passed a radical motion calling for a ""socialist green new deal"", Starmer was asked directly whether he would consider nationalising the main energy providers to tackle the energy crisis. He replied: ""No."" Instead, speaking shortly before Miliband was due to deliver his conference speech, he said Labour would advocate nationalisation only in certain circumstances. ""When it comes to common ownership, I'm pragmatic about it,"" he said. ""Let me spell it out. What that means is that where common ownership is value for money for the taxpayer and delivers a better service, then I'm in favour of common ownership."" By contrast, Miliband suggested on Newsnight earlier in the week that the party was about to renew its commitment to common ownership of energy and other public resources. ""We haven't changed that commitment,"" Miliband said. ""If we're going to make this green transition, then public ownership is the right way to go."" The shadow business secretary has not yet set out which elements of the system Labour would take into public ownership – but it is understood he was not ready to rule out nationalising energy providers, preferring to set out details closer to the next general election. The ""big six"" controlled about 70% of the energy supply market in 2019. A senior Labour source, asked whether Miliband or Starmer were setting out Labour's stance, said the party's policy was ""what Keir says it is"". The Labour leader's comments came as delegates at the party's conference in Brighton overwhelmingly backed a motion calling for the party to adopt a series of radical climate policies. As well as nationalisation of the energy sector, these included the creation of a ""national nature service,"" ""a government programme creating millions of well-paid, unionised green jobs with publicly owned entities,"" and ""mass investment in green technologies and renewables"". Gaya Sriskanthan, Momentum co-chair, said: ""This is a turning point. The grassroots have had enough of timid centrism and have overwhelmingly endorsed transformative socialist policy that meets the crises of the 21st century head on."" Starmer's comments on the big six appeared to contradict his own stance when he was seeking Labour members' votes during last year's leadership contest. One of his 10 key pledges was that ""public services should be in public hands, not making profits for shareholders. Support common ownership of rail, mail, energy and water."" Sriskanthan said: ""Starmer has spent long enough running away from his 10 pledges. It's time to support transformative policy. Labour members back bold solutions – the leadership needs to follow suit."" In his conference speech on Sunday, against a backdrop of queues outside petrol stations and empty shelves in supermarkets, Miliband reminded Labour members of David Cameron's warning: ""Britain faces a simple and inescapable choice – stability and strong Government with me, or chaos with Ed Miliband."" ""I'll tell you one thing: I'd have done a damn sight better than this miserable shower,"" he said. Miliband said it was Labour's responsibility ""to be the party of green and red together. To be the party of climate and economic justice together."" Chris Saltmarsh, co-chair and co-founder of party pressure group Labour for a Green New Deal, said: ""It's fantastic to hear Labour talking about building a vision around a green new deal, but it must back up words with policies. ""As new polling shows, a majority of the public are in favour of renationalising our energy companies. This is the perfect opportunity to build on that support and deliver a unifying, ambitious programme for climate justice."" Starmer will make his own speech on Wednesday, the first in person since taking over the leadership last year, after kicking off the gathering with an internecine wrangle about how his successor will be chosen. Starmer announced a new policy on Sunday of scrapping the charitable status of England's private schools, and spending the money on giving children more soft skills to make them more work-ready. Starmer said: ""This is a political choice to take that money and switch it to our state schools so that children and young people in our state schools have the best chance they can have to come out of schools ready for life, ready for work.""",Real Guardian,771.0
596,Real,The Guardian,"Keir Starmer stunned even some close colleagues earlier this week when he abruptly announced plans to push through a radical overhaul of the way Labour elects its leaders at the party's conference in Brighton. Leaders of Labour-supporting unions were furious about not being consulted in advance, and some shadow cabinet members appeared bemused by the timing of the risky move, just as the government was gripped by a looming winter crisis.  Starmer had repeatedly insisted he wanted Labour to look outwards, not inwards – after the Hartlepool byelection defeat in May, he said the party spent too much time ""talking to ourselves"". Yet this week's conference kicked off with fraught negotiations over how his successor will be chosen. Starmer was sent packing from a meeting with trade unions on Friday without their support for the plans, then was forced to make a late-night U-turn and abandon his preferred proposal of a return to an electoral college. But after hours of negotiations, a reform package was agreed on Saturday that the majority of NEC members could sign up to – one that included the requirement for future leadership candidates to gain the support of 20% of MPs, up from 10% under current rules. The phenomenon of a wave of new joiners swaying the result, like the ""three quidders"" who flooded into the Labour party to back Jeremy Corbyn in 2015, will also be prevented: members will have to have joined the party at least six months earlier to take part. It will also be made harder to force sitting MPs to face a reselection battle, with the support of 50% of members and affiliates now needed to launch the process. Many around Starmer see this as the most crucial win from the package, despite most of the headlines being around the leadership changes. They argue it will prevent MPs spending months in the run-up to the next general election fending off resistance from their own constituency parties. One supportive shadow cabinet member suggested Labour could now have 10 more MPs, had they not been distracted through 2019 by reselection battles. The reform package was voted through on Sunday afternoon after a sustained lobbying effort from frontbenchers, including on the conference floor, and Starmer's supporters now feel the high-stakes gamble with his own party has paid off. Despite the embarrassment of ditching the electoral college, the proposals have delighted the party's ardent centrists, who have spent much of the past five years weighing up how best to prevent a political outlier like Corbyn from ever winning again. Deeply scarred by that period, which culminated in a damning report about the handling of antisemitism complaints by the Equality and Human Rights Commission and the worst electoral loss since 1935, they see it as essential to raise the hurdles for future candidates to jump. A spokesperson for Starmer said the package would ""better connect us with working people and reorient us toward the voters who can take us to power"". In pressing the reforms, however, Starmer appears to have decisively ended any lingering sense that he would seek to act as a bridge between Labour's warring factions. Instead, he appears determined to take on and defeat the Corbynite left. Some senior party figures blame a small group of advisers around him, obsessed with preventing the party falling into the hands of a leftwinger. But backers of the plans argue they will help get Labour in fighting form for the next general election, leaving next year's conference free to set out the stall for a potential 2023 general election. One veteran of the battles during the Corbyn era said Starmer had ""done his duty by the institution"" of the Labour party. But in doing so, he has set one wing of the party against another once again. NEC members from rival camps were sparring openly on Twitter on Saturday after the reforms were discussed. During his leadership campaign, Starmer was able to use the issue of Brexit to cut across Labour's great left-right rift, winning over many former Corbyn fans in the process. But in Brighton this weekend, the party's deep divisions were on clear display.",Real Guardian,692.0
597,Real,The Guardian,"A Labour government would seek to drive up wages by empowering trade unions to negotiate minimum rates of pay across key sectors, starting with adult social care, Angela Rayner will announce on Saturday . Rayner, Labour's deputy leader, will set out plans at the party's annual conference for fair pay agreements aimed at strengthening workers' bargaining powers, particularly in sectors plagued by low pay and insecure contracts.  The policy, which echoes an approach recently adopted in New Zealand, would introduce government-backed negotiations between unions and employers across an entire sector, rather than firm by firm. These would set minimum pay rates and basic conditions, which would then become a mandatory ""floor"" across the sector. ""Working people don't want a handout from a minister sat in Whitehall,"" Rayner writes in a Guardian article as Labour meets in Brighton for its conference this weekend. ""Workers want the power to stand up for themselves and to demand a fair share of the wealth that they create. Working people are proud of the work that we do, but we want dignity, respect and a better deal for our class. Tory ministers don't understand that because they don't understand working people – they just expect us to know our place and take what we are given."" Rayner will say the policy would be implemented within 100 days of a Labour government being elected, with adult social care the first sector to be covered. Frances O'Grady, the secretary general of the TUC, described the plan as a ""gamechanger"". ""Many of the key workers who got us through this crisis – including our dedicated care staff – are on poverty wages and insecure contracts. Fair pay agreements would help end this injustice and be a gamechanger for millions of working families,"" she said. Labour's policy forms part of a paper on employment rights being published this weekend, which also includes the promise of a £10-an-hour minimum wage and legislation to ensure workers have full employment rights from day one. Rayner, who was a homecare worker before being elected to Westminster, says when MPs discuss the social care crisis they rarely consider the implications of low pay in the sector. ""For my old workmates on the frontline a 'crisis' means that the care workers who have put their lives on the line throughout this pandemic can't feed their families and pay their bills. 'Crisis' means that there aren't enough care workers to look after the people who need care. ""This creates a vicious circle of staff vacancies and high turnover rates, which in turn leaves staff at breaking point and devastated because they are trapped in a system that does not enable them to provide the best care for people who need it,"" she said. In New Zealand, when fair pay agreements come into force next year unions will be able to trigger negotiations if they represent 1,000 workers in a particular industry, or 10% of its total workforce. The talks can cover maximum hours, holiday pay and other terms and conditions, as well as hourly pay rates. Sectoral collective bargaining was included in Labour's 2019 manifesto. Rayner's recommitment to the idea underlines the party's continued close links to trade unions despite fears among some leftwingers about a lurch to the right under Keir Starmer. Starmer hopes to put a fresh offer for workers at the heart of Labour's appeal at the next general election. In a lengthy essay published earlier this week ahead of Labour's conference in Brighton, he stressed the importance of ensuring that effort is rewarded, and promised a ""new settlement"" between businesses, government and the public. Labour has criticised the government's planned increase in national insurance contributions – badged as a health and social care levy – saying it will ""hammer"" working people. Rayner secured the title of shadow secretary of state for the future of work in Starmer's botched reshuffle in May, and has since announced several policies, including a right to flexible working. She will give her speech to Labour's Brighton conference on Saturday, fresh from a spiky performance at prime minister's questions against the deputy prime minister, Dominic Raab. Labour members are gathering in the seaside resort for five days of debate, likely to be dominated by questions over the direction of Starmer's leadership. He will give his own keenly anticipated speech – his first face-to-face to party members – on Wednesday.",Real Guardian,732.0
598,Real,The Guardian,"Keir Starmer is in ""discussions"" about whether to press ahead with radical changes to the way Labour elects its leaders, after pulling plans to put the proposals to a vote at the party's ruling national executive committee (NEC). The Labour leader had been expected to push the package of reforms at a meeting on Friday evening. But after he addressed sceptical union leaders on Friday afternoon, Starmer's office said they would not be tabled.  Instead, they suggested, discussions were ongoing. Trade union sources said Starmer had made an emollient speech to TULO, the group that represents the Labour-supporting unions – but that none of the unions present had backed the plans. One source suggested Starmer had received a ""mauling"" for announcing the plans to drop the one-member-one-votesystem to elect the party leader without consulting unions in advance. Starmer now faces a tough decision about whether to press ahead in the face of union opposition, water down the proposals, or pull them altogether, rather than risk a humiliating defeat in Brighton, where the party's conference will open on Saturday. It emerged on Friday that Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, had added her voice to those in the party who oppose the idea of overshadowing conference with a wrangle over rule changes. Rayner, the shadow secretary of state for the future of work as well as Starmer's number two, has privately made clear that she would like the conference to focus instead on attacking the government and setting out Labour's offer to the country. She is understood to be concerned by the timing of the changes and the principle of ditching one member, one vote. Rayner was the latest senior party figure to question Starmer's tactics. The battle over the proposals rages just as he prepares to set out what Labour stands for in a keenly awaited party conference speech next Wednesday. The Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, also questioned the move, telling the Daily Record: ""I don't think it should be our focus. It is certainly not my focus. I'm going to conference to talk about the issues I care about."" The Labour mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, appeared lukewarm about the changes this week, saying: ""It's not at the fore of my mind."" Many senior party figures were blindsided when Starmer announced to the shadow cabinet this week that he would like to see a return to an electoral college for choosing his successor, reversing the shift made by Ed Miliband to a one-member-one-vote system. An electoral college would give one-third of the vote to unions and a third to Labour MPs, with members making up the rest. The backing of the unions helped Miliband clinch the leadership over his brother David in the 2010 contest. Labour members tend to be more leftwing than MPs, so the move is seen by many on the left as an attempt to avoid a repeat of the 2015 leadership contest, which swept the radical outsider Jeremy Corbyn into the leader's office. However, critics claim that Starmer – who has previously stressed the importance of party unity – is being drawn into a factional showdown with the left when he should be challenging Boris Johnson over the cost-of-living crisis. The NEC is expected to meet again on Saturday and Sunday, and the leadership could decide to table the proposals then. They would then have to come to the conference floor for a vote. Sarwar's deputy, Jackie Baillie, is proposing an amendment to the electoral college plan in which MSPs, Welsh assembly members and Labour councillors would be given a vote as well as MPs, to better reflect the makeup of the party's elected representatives. As well as changing the leadership rules, Starmer also wants to streamline Labour's policymaking process, shifting power away from the annual conference, and to make it harder to reselect sitting MPs. Unite's new leader, Sharon Graham, has criticised the plans, writing to Labour MPs to urge them to reject the return to an electoral college, calling it ""unfair, undemocratic and a backward step"". Recent Labour conferences have frequently been marred by battles over rule changes, including a failed attempt in 2019 to abolish the deputy leader Tom Watson's job on the eve of the annual gathering.",Real Guardian,707.0
599,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson has flown back to the UK after his transatlantic jaunt reassured about his personal relationship with Joe Biden after the pair sought to put the chaos of the Kabul airlift behind them with face-to-face talks in the Oval Office. The warm personal rapport that characterised Johnson's relationship with Donald Trump – who called him ""Britain Trump"" – was not obviously on display as he and Biden briefly addressed the press before retiring for private talks. Biden told an involved anecdote about travelling more than a million miles on Amtrak, which US reporters revealed he has wheeled out on several other occasions.  Once the press had been forcefully ushered out by White House media handlers, however, witnesses said the pair held constructive talks. They discussed expanding the Aukus pact – announced last week – into a broader alliance that could cover other areas of shared interest, including safeguarding human rights, technology and expanding open markets. And on Capitol Hill, Johnson took the opportunity to try to soothe concerns about the operation of the Northern Ireland protocol, saying he remained committed to the Good Friday agreement. But news that the UK has all but abandoned hopes of a bilateral free trade agreement with the US underlined the fact that to bond with Biden, Johnson has had to trim his ambitions to fit the president's agenda. The arch dealmaker Trump used to boast about the prospects for a trade agreement with the UK, but Biden has a packed legislative agenda at home that will take precedence over trying to win congressional backing for a complex set of trade negotiations. As well as taking on China – essentially the purpose of the Aukus pact – the two countries are both committed to tackling the climate crisis, and in doing so, creating more green jobs in their own economies. Johnson's hopes of securing a successful outcome to the Cop26 climate summit in November that keeps 1.5C of warming within reach took a significant step forward when Biden doubled the US's contribution to climate finance. When the prime minister met Biden's vice-president, Kamala Harris, they were able to agree that the $11.2bn US climate pledge made it, as Johnson put it, ""a great day for the world"". Other tangible gains from the visit were harder to come by: Johnson said he had won the backing of the president to lift the ban on British lamb exports, though consultations are ongoing and no formal decision has yet been announced. No 10 was also keen to claim credit for the lifting of the US travel ban, claiming a bilateral ""travel taskforce"" that has been operating since the summer had helped to change the Americans' minds. But the changes apply equally to scores of countries. The UK government appeared to have had little warning that the decision would be announced on Monday morning, and was left scrambling to establish the details, including whether AstraZeneca jabs would be accepted under the new system. But Downing Street will be happy to bank the intangible benefits of a closer rapport with the US – and Johnson, no fan of Zoom calls, returns to the UK energised by three days of the kind of politics he likes best: up close and personal.",Real Guardian,542.0
600,Real,The Guardian,"Cop26 must be a ""turning point for humanity"" in just 40 days' time, Boris Johnson has urged in a call to arms to fellow global leaders ahead of the climate summit in Glasgow. Addressing the UN general assembly in New York on Wednesday evening, Johnson warned it was time for humanity to ""grow up"".  ""It is time for us to listen to the warnings of the scientists – and look at Covid, if you want an example of gloomy scientists being proved right – and to understand who we are and what we are doing."" ""The world – this precious blue sphere with its eggshell crust and wisp of an atmosphere – is not some indestructible toy, some bouncy plastic romper room against which we can hurl ourselves to our heart's content,"" he added. He compared humanity to an impetuous 16-year-old ""just old enough to get ourselves into serious trouble"". ""We have come to that fateful age when we know roughly how to drive and we know how to unlock the drinks cabinet and to engage in all sorts of activity that is not only potentially embarrassing but also terminal,"" he said. ""We believe that someone else will clear up the mess we make, because that is what someone else has always done,"" he said. ""We trash our habitats again and again with the inductive reasoning that we have got away with it so far, and therefore we will get away with it again. ""My friends, the adolescence of humanity is coming to an end,"" Johnson, said, adding: ""We must come together in a collective coming of age."" Johnson also claimed the Muppets character Kermit the Frog was wrong when he sang: ""It's not easy being green."" He also offered a lengthy explanation of the Greek word deinos. ""Sophocles is often quoted as saying that there are many terrifying things in the world, but none is more terrifying than man,"" he said. ""But what Sophocles actually said was that man is deinos and that means not just scary but awesome – and he was right. ""We are awesome in our power to change things and awesome in our power to save ourselves, and in the next 40 days we must choose what kind of awesome we are going to be."" He highlighted technological developments that have made green energy cheaper and more accessible, and warned that unless action is taken urgently, ""we will have made this beautiful planet effectively uninhabitable – not just for us but for many other species."" The prime minister has been buoyed up by progress on climate during the three-day trip, including President Joe Biden's commitment to double climate financing to $11.2bn – and China's promise to halt the funding of coal-fired power stations overseas. With just weeks to go until the summit, the UK is urging more countries to come forward with climate financing, to help meet the $100bn target set more than a decade ago. Cop26 chair Alok Sharma has also been in New York holding bilateral meetings with a string of countries, urging them to come forward both with cash, and more ambitious climate reduction targets, in the next few weeks. Biden has confirmed that he will attend the summit in person – but it is unclear whether president Xi Jinping will do so. En route to the US, the prime minister suggested he believed there was only a six in ten chance of the $100bn target being reached, but the odds appear to have shortened significantly after the US announcement. Johnson said it was critical that the outcome of Cop26 kept within reach the target of restraining global heating to within 1.5 degrees. ""We are not talking about stopping the rise in temperatures – it is alas too late for that – but to restrain that growth to 1.5 degrees. And that means we need to pledge collectively to achieve carbon neutrality – net zero – by the middle of the century. And that will be an amazing moment if we can do it,"" he said. At the start of his visit to the US, Johnson conceded that he had changed his mind on the climate crisis in recent years, because ""the facts change and people change their minds"". He told reporters that he had looked deeply into the science while mayor of London. As recently as 2015, Johnson claimed ""global leaders were driven by a primitive fear that the present ambient warm weather is somehow caused by humanity; and that fear – as far as I understand the science – is equally without foundation"". He also wrote an article in 2013 suggesting the government should consider preparing for a mini-ice age caused by solar activity, drawing on a discredited theory by the climate denier Piers Corbyn – brother of the former Labour leader.",Real Guardian,803.0
601,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson has reopened the rift with Paris over the Aukus defence and security deal, urging the French to ""prenez un grip about this and donnez-moi un break"", after he and Joe Biden discussed deepening the pact. The prime minister was speaking in Washington, where he attended a dinner on Tuesday evening with the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, after meeting the US president at the White House.  Johnson and Biden talked about extending their cooperation through the pact to cover further issues including safeguarding human rights and promoting free markets – and ruled out inviting more countries to join. Johnson said: ""What I found on Capitol Hill was that they want to populate the agenda with all sorts of other things which matter."" He cited the need for a western rival to telecom giant Huawei, which the UK government recently decided to remove from some parts of the country's critical infrastructure because of security concerns. ""What we need is a western technology on which we can all rely,"" he said. He added that he and Biden had been surprised at the strength of the reaction from Paris regarding Aukus – and claimed to be ready to smooth things over. ""I think everybody has been a bit taken aback by the strength of the French reaction and we all want to reach out,"" he said, adding: ""We love the French."" The US and UK governments believed Australia had signalled the development to France in advance, but the message appeared to have been missed in Paris. Morrison is understood to have reassured the UK prime minister at their dinner in Washington that he had carried the message to Paris as promised. Asked whether he understood why the French were annoyed, he said: ""It's just one of those things – there are no easy ways of having these conversations – it's a very human thing to delay until the last possible moment."" Some Downing Street officials believe the French government has kept the public spat running so vocally in an attempt to ensure they receive the maximum compensation for the cancellation of the submarine contract. Johnson's latest comments came as Biden moved to soothe French fury. After a phone conversation between him and Emmanuel Macron, France announced that it would return its ambassador to the US and Biden vowed not to cut Paris out of key future defence decisions in the Indo-Pacific. In a joint statement issued after a phone call ended a five-day standoff between the leaders, the two men agreed to meet in Europe in late October, probably at the G20 summit, to discuss how to improve consultations in future. Macron said he would despatch his withdrawn ambassador to Washington next week, but there was no sign that the US or Australia were going to go back on their decision to work together on building nuclear powered submarines, a decision that led Canberra to cancel its A$90bn contract for the French to build diesel-based submarines. Biden instead said the US would be supplying extra help to the French-led anti-terrorist operations in the Sahel. The joint statement also sought to remove any suggestion that the Americans regarded the independently minded French as unreliable partners in the efforts to constrain China in the Indo-Pacific, the chief unstated purpose of the Aukus pact. Paris reacted with fury after the announcement of the three-way pact. When withdrawing their US and Australian ambassadors, France dismissed the UK's role as that of a ""fifth wheel"", and claiming it shows Downing Street is in ""vassalage"" to Washington. Asked about the backlash on Wednesday after discussing the pact with Biden and Morrison, Johnson said: ""I just think it's time for some of our dearest friends around the world to prenez un grip about this and donnez-moi un break. ""Because this is fundamentally a great step forward for global security. It's three very like-minded allies standing shoulder to shoulder creating a new partnership for the sharing of technology. It's not exclusive. It's not trying to shoulder anybody out. It's not adversarial towards China for instance."" Johnson has been forced to acknowledge during his US visit that a bilateral trade deal with Washington appears a distant prospect, with Biden's priorities lying with his domestic agenda, including passing the Build Back Better bill. Government sources have suggested the UK could bid to join the US-Mexico-Canada trade deal instead. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, will travel to Mexico on Wednesday, and the Mexican government signalled on Tuesday it did not reject the idea outright. Johnson's official spokesperson has insisted striking a bilateral trade deal with the US – something the PM had previously suggested would be straightforward – remained the UK's priority.",Real Guardian,781.0

""I feel very strongly,"" he said, when asked about the Northern Ireland protocol. ""We spent an enormous amount of time and effort in the United States. It was a major partisan effort, and I would not like to see – nor would many of my Republican colleagues – a change in the Irish accord.""

He will meet Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell and Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, as well as the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi. The UK has repeatedly delayed the implementation of some of the checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and warned that the protocol is proving disruptive to trade flows. Responding to Biden, Johnson said: ""We are completely at one, because nobody wants to see anything that interrupts or unbalances the Belfast or Good Friday agreement."" Johnson irked the Dutch government earlier this week by claiming that prime minister Mark Rutte had offered to mediate in the dispute between the EU and the UK over the implementation of the complex rules. The prime minister is expected to set out the UK's concerns about the way the protocol is being implemented as he meets key figures on Capitol Hill on Wednesday as part of a Washington charm offensive.

603,Real,The Guardian,"Britain's hopes of a post-Brexit trade deal with the US have all but evaporated barring a dramatic change of heart from Joe Biden, it emerged on Tuesday as Boris Johnson held face-to-face talks in the White House. Johnson once regarded a bilateral free trade agreement with the US as a key Brexit win, highlighting the prospects for British exporters unfettered from the EU. But government insiders privately concede that they see little prospect of progress towards a one-to-one deal, as the Biden administration focuses on other priorities.  When Johnson was asked on Tuesday whether he still hoped to strike a free-trade agreement with the US by the time of the next general election, opening the way to lower tariffs and a closer economic relationship, he said ""we're going as fast as we can"", but declined to confirm whether it could be achieved before 2024. When the US president was asked about the prospects of a deal as the pair met in the Oval Office, he said: ""We're going to talk about trade a little bit today, and we're going to have to work that through."" The UK is now understood to be considering alternative options, including seeking to join the US-Canada-Mexico trade deal instead of striking a bilateral agreement with Washington. A senior government source said: ""There are a variety of different ways to do this. The question is whether the US administration is ready. The ball is in the US's court. It takes two to tango."" The government is understood to have made the point to the US that after signing a string of recent bilateral agreements, Britain now has closer trade relations with Canada or Mexico than the US despite the so-called special relationship. Later on in the bilateral talks, the pair exchanged gifts. Johnson gave Biden a signed copy of astronaut Tim Peak's book, Hello, is this Planet Earth?, inscribed by Peake with the message: ""I hope this book provides a reminder of what we are fighting to save as our countries battle climate change together"". Biden gave the prime minister a framed photograph of them at the Carbis Bay G7 summit earlier this year – and a White House-branded watch. Johnson was keen to showcase the strength of his relationship with Biden on his US trip after a fraught summer in which the UK appeared to be denied key information about the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. He has claimed the US-UK partnership is at its strongest for ""decades"". Biden also underlined the importance of ensuring peace in Northern Ireland is not jeopardised by post-Brexit tensions. ""I feel very strongly,"" he said. ""We spent an enormous amount of time and effort in the United States. It was a major partisan effort, and I would not like to see – nor would many of my Republican colleagues – a change in the Irish accord"". Speaking to US broadcaster NBC on Tuesday, Johnson played down differences with Biden over the Afghanistan withdrawal, which led to the Taliban capturing Kabul and the chaotic evacuation. Asked if he had been forced to wait 36 hours to speak to Biden directly about the situation in Afghanistan, he said: ""I don't discuss my calls with other leaders but to the best of my recollection we talked very frankly about the whole thing."" Pressed on whether he agreed with Biden's decision to set and stick to a date for the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, he said: ""America has been there for 20 years and it's a respectable argument to say 'enough is enough'."" He added: ""Could we have done things differently? Perhaps we could."" The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, who is travelling with Johnson, said she hoped to link trade and diplomacy more closely in her new role, highlighting the potential for UK jobs from the Aukus security deal announced last week. Trade was not among the issues Downing Street highlighted before the discussion between Johnson and Biden, who met in the Oval Office. Instead, the prime minister was expected to raise the climate crisis, Aukus and details of the US's new travel regime. The UK had appeared blindsided by the travel announcement on Monday, with Johnson warning journalists en route to the US that ""I wouldn't hold your breath"" for developments this week. As he arrived in Washington by train from New York, Johnson welcomed Biden's announcement of a significant increase in US climate funding for developing countries, raising the prospect that the $100bn (£73bn) target set a decade ago could be reached before the Cop26 summit in November. Biden told the UN general assembly that the US would double its contribution, from $5.6bn to $11.2bn. Johnson said the announcement was ""game changing,"" and he wanted to see similar levels of ambition from other rich countries. The US and UK have worked closely on the climate but little progress has been made in recent months on deepening trade ties. Biden only appointed a chief agricultural trade negotiator, Elaine Trevino, last week, and has not yet appointed a new ambassador to London. Agriculture would be likely to be a key element of any deal.",Real Guardian,852.0
604,Real,The Guardian,"On Boris Johnson's first trip to meet Joe Biden in Washington, the prime minister was on a charm offensive as he attempts to nurture the special relationship despite their political differences. Biden has been sceptical about Johnson, partly because of the prime minister's comments from 2016 claiming that Barack Obama had a bust of Churchill removed from the White House because, Johnson said, of ""the part-Kenyan president's ancestral dislike of the British empire"".  But since Biden came to power the two men have struck a cordial tone, finding common ground on the Aukus defence pact and the climate crisis, though dividing lines between the US Democrat and British Conservative remain. Johnson made clear en route to the US that he wanted to galvanise action towards a successful outcome at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in November – a goal shared by Biden. In particular, the UK was hoping for more progress towards the target of $100bn in climate finance for developing countries, set more than a decade ago. The prime minister suggested there was only a 60% chance the target would be met before the summit, but the odds were significantly shortened after Biden announced on Tuesday that he was doubling the US's contribution to $11.2bn. Johnson welcomed Biden's climate funding pledge as a ""very good start"" that took them ""a long way towards the goal"". With many countries yet to announce fresh emissions reduction targets, and no confirmation that the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, will attend the summit in person, Biden and Johnson are likely to discuss how best to secure a deal that keeps a 1.5C limit on global heating within reach. While their politics are radically different, Johnson has stressed that both men would like to spark a ""green industrial revolution"", tackling the climate crisis while creating hundreds of thousands of jobs in clean energy. The fraught withdrawal from Afghanistan raised profound questions about the relationship between the US and the UK, with London apparently kept in the dark about Washington's intentions at key moments in the crisis. The prime minister was forced to resort to publicly lobbying Biden to delay the US departure to allow more time for the evacuation to take place – a request that fell on deaf ears. The two men are unlikely to have dwelt on past misunderstandings, instead focusing on discussing how to deal with the new Taliban government and whether a humanitarian crisis in the region can be averted. The US, UK and Australia blindsided allies by announcing Aukus, a defence and security alliance for the Indo-China region. France reacted with fury, withdrawing its ambassadors from Washington and Canberra for consultation – pointedly leaving out the UK, which it has dismissed as the ""fifth wheel"" in the alliance. Johnson is keen to show the pact is more than an attempt to placate Washington and reflects the UK's strategic interests. Biden is hawkish on China, and eager for the world's democracies to form fresh alliances – he will host a virtual ""leaders' summit for democracy"" in December. Johnson echoed that approach by inviting countries including Australia, India and South Korea to the G7 summit in Cornwall in June, making a wider group that the UK has suggested could be a ""D10"" of major democracies. After meeting Biden, Johnson was due to dine with the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, to hail the Aukus deal. Downing Street had been frustrated by the US travel ban applying to the UK, and lobbied for change. But it appeared to be blindsided by Monday's announcement that the US would lift the ban for the UK and many other countries. Fully vaccinated people will now be able to travel to the US without having to quarantine, but key details of the policy remain ambiguous, including whether the US will accept the AstraZeneca vaccine and whether children will be exempted. Johnson was expected to press Biden on these questions on Tuesday, but No 10 was pleased that the overarching restrictions are being ditched. The UK has sought to claim some of the credit for the change of policy, pointing to a bilateral travel taskforce that has met since the summer, but the new regime applies equally to scores of countries.",Real Guardian,705.0
605,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson has admitted for the first time that he has six children, claiming in an interview on US television that he ""changes a lot of nappies"". The prime minister has previously tended to avoid questions about his notoriously complex family life. He has been divorced twice, and conceived a daughter during an extramarital relationship.  But when an NBC interviewer put to him that he has six children, he replied: ""Yes."" Johnson has a one-year-old child, Wilfred, with his wife, Carrie Johnson. He said it was ""fantastic"" to have children in Number 10, claiming: ""I change a lot of nappies."" The couple are now expecting another baby. Johnson also has four adult children with his second wife, Marina Wheeler, and his daughter from his extramarital relationship. It has been reported that Johnson could have conceived another child or children beyond those known about, but he has refused to discuss this. Ahead of the 2019 general election, Johnson was openly asked about this during a phone in on LBC radio, in which he was challenged by a caller about an article he wrote in 1995 in which he blamed single mothers for ""producing a generation of ill-raised, ignorant, aggressive and illegitimate children"". After the exchange, host Nick Ferrari pressed Johnson on how many children he had. ""I think what people want to hear is what plans we have,"" Johnson replied. ""I love my children very much but they are not standing at this election and I'm not therefore going to comment."" Asked if he was ""fully and wholly involved in all their lives"", Johnson again refused to comment, saying: ""I am not going to put them on to the pitch in this election campaign."" In his NBC interview on Tuesday, the prime minister referred to the US president, Joe Biden, whom he will meet in the White House later in the day, as a ""breath of fresh air"". The pair are expected to discuss issues including this summer's botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the prospects for a successful outcome to the Cop26 climate summit in November. In his NBC interview, Johnson denied that he had been snubbed by Biden at times during the crisis. ""I don't discuss my calls with other leaders but to the best of my recollection we talked very frankly about the whole thing,"" he said. Asked if he agreed with Biden's decision to set and stick to a date for withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, he said: ""America has been there for 20 years and it's a respectable argument to say 'enough is enough',"" adding: ""Could we have done things differently? Perhaps we could.""",Real Guardian,439.0
606,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson has refused to guarantee that he will not have to disrupt Christmas gatherings for a second year running by imposing Covid restrictions, though he insisted it was ""very much not the plan"". Last year the prime minister repeatedly struck an upbeat note about Christmas before imposing stringent last-minute conditions preventing many people from seeing friends and family as the Alpha variant spread rapidly.  Days before the tough new restrictions were announced, Johnson taunted the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, that he wanted to ""cancel Christmas"". This year Johnson appears to be sticking to the government's cautious new line of not giving any guarantees about what the virus response may demand. Asked whether he would promise not to ruin a second Christmas in a row, Johnson said: ""That is very much not the plan. ""I just want to go back to what I said about plan A and plan B,"" he added. ""Plan A is what we're on, and plan B is what we might have to do. It's a graduated series of steps and we certainly don't want or expect to have to do anything like last Christmas."" Confronted with remarks he made last year about 2021 being a ""two-turkey Christmas,"" he joked that people could defrost last year's bird. Last week the government set out its ""plan A"" for managing the pandemic through the autumn and winter, involving booster jabs for over-50s and vaccinations for 12-15-year-olds. Ministers also set out a series of contingency plans, including potentially making masks mandatory in some settings and reinstating work-from-home advice. The NHS has announced that 1.5 million people will be contacted this week inviting them to book in their booster vaccinations. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation approved the UK's booster programme last week. There was no mention in the document of lockdowns, and the government is confident it can manage the pandemic with more modest measures given the high rates of vaccination. But the plan also warned: ""There remains considerable uncertainty, and scenarios which place the NHS under extreme and unsustainable pressure remain plausible."" At another point it said: ""The nature of the virus means it is not possible to give guarantees."" Johnson was speaking as he arrived in the US for a three-day visit, after reshuffling his cabinet last week. No 10 hopes that with the worst of the pandemic over, it can shift the focus to delivering on its domestic agenda of ""levelling up"", as well as achieving an ambitious outcome to the Cop26 summit in November. Johnson highlighted the importance of Michael Gove's role in the newly renamed Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, and he played down suggestions that the reshuffle meant he was considering an early general election. ""We are focused absolutely resolutely and implacably on the task in hand and in delivering on our manifesto commitments; making the country safer – putting more police on the streets; building more hospitals; fixing social care; uniting and levelling up across the country,"" he said. ""We attach massive significance towards what Michael Gove is doing in his new department,"" he said, also highlighting the appointment of the former Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane to the department to oversee levelling up policy. ""He won't be there forever but he's got a lot to offer and again a signal of the seriousness to which we attach this mission of levelling up,"" he said.",Real Guardian,569.0
607,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson has acknowledged that he has altered his views about the climate crisis over recent years, saying, ""the facts change and people change their minds"". As he travelled to the US in a bid to accelerate progress towards an agreement at the Cop26 climate summit, the prime minister was asked about the views of his new international trade secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan.  The shadow international trade secretary, Emily Thornberry, had highlighted a series of tweets sent by Trevelyan between 2010 and 2012 that explicitly rejected the science of global heating. ""Clear evidence that the ice caps aren't melting after all, to counter those doom-mongers and global warming fanatics,"" read one. Another, sent in support of a campaign against windfarms, said: ""We aren't getting hotter, global warming isn't actually happening."" A third approvingly shared an article by an explicitly climate emergency-rejecting Twitter account Climate Realists. Challenged about Trevelyan's record, the prime minister said: ""Anne-Marie will do an outstanding job as secretary of state for international trade."" He then went on to raise his own past record as a climate sceptic. ""I don't want to encourage you, but if you were to excavate some of my articles from 20 years ago you might find comments I made, obiter dicta, about climate change that weren't entirely supportive of the current struggle, but the facts change and people change their minds and change their views and that's very important too,"" he said, adding: ""The fact is the UK is leading the world and you should be proud of it."" As recently as 2015, Johnson claimed ""global leaders were driven by a primitive fear that the present ambient warm weather is somehow caused by humanity; and that fear – as far as I understand the science – is equally without foundation"". He also wrote an article in 2013 suggesting the government should consider preparing for a mini-ice age caused by solar activity, drawing on a discredited theory by the climate denier Piers Corbyn – brother of the former Labour leader. And in the same year, Johnson said windfarms – now a key part of the government's plan to transition to net zero – couldn't ""pull the skin off a rice pudding"". Johnson was expressing scepticism at a time when there was already a strong scientific consensus about the science of global heating. Some friends attribute the prime minister's newfound enthusiasm for the cause of tackling the climate crisis partly to the influence of his wife, Carrie Johnson, who is an enthusiastic advocate of conservation.",Real Guardian,420.0
608,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson has said he fears there is only a 60% chance that the $100bn in climate finance viewed as key to securing an ambitious outcome to the Cop26 summit will be in place by the time world leaders meet in Glasgow in November. Speaking to journalists en route to New York at the start of a three-day visit to the US, in which he hopes to ""galvanise"" progress towards a new climate deal, the prime minister said he would be urging developed countries to come forward with additional funding.  ""There's a roundtable with the climate-vulnerable countries [on Monday]: they need support from the rest of the world if they're going to make the transition in the way that they must. And the developing world looks to us,"" he said. ""We began fossil fuel emissions, it was our country that had the first sustained Industrial Revolution. We began it, and they look to us to help them move beyond hydrocarbon technology."" Asked if he thought the $100bn total could be reached this week, he said: ""Getting it all this week is going to be a stretch. Getting it all done by Cop, six out of 10. It's going to be tough."" G7 countries promised more than a decade ago at the Copenhagen summit to make $100bn in private and public finance available to developing countries, to help them transition to low-carbon technologies and cope with extreme weather. Analysis from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published last week suggested that so far only $80bn has been raised, however. G7 leaders recommitted to the target at June's summit in Cornwall, but Johnson was criticised for failing to secure concrete pledges. The UK is expected to publish a breakdown of individual countries' commitments at the end of this week. Cop26 chair Alok Sharma travelled with Johnson to the US, as the UK steps up diplomatic efforts to secure a successful outcome to the summit. Johnson will hold a string of bilateral meetings with fellow leaders, and said he would be pressing them about ""coal, cars, trees and cash"". ""We'll be pushing for everybody to step up to the plate on getting rid of coal-fired power-stations, in the way that we have in the UK – a massive reduction in our dependence on coal; getting rid of hydrocarbon internal combustion engine motor vehicles, so that we all move towards electric vehicles; and planting hundreds of millions of hectares of trees; and getting the finance that's necessary to do this,"" he said. The government has announced that £550m of the £11.6bn it had set aside for climate finance over the next five years will be allocated to developing countries, as part of the UK's contribution to the $100bn target. There are growing concerns about China's attitude to the talks, after Beijing was irked by the Aukus deal – the security and defence pact between Australia, the UK and the US. Speaking on Sunday, Sharma was unable to say whether President Xi would attend Cop26. Johnson lavished praise on China's role in tackling the climate crisis, saying: ""The Chinese actually have stepped up. They've gone a long way already and I congratulate President Xi on his vision."" He added, ""Alok has had some great conversations already with his Chinese counterparts about the things they want to do. I think China is massively important on this but it shows real signs of making progress."" The prime minister will meet Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro on the sidelines of UN general assembly this week. Asked whether he would challenge the avowed climate sceptic about the burning of the Amazon rainforest, Johnson said: ""Yes. We want to stop and reverse the global loss of biodiversity, including in the rainforest. ""I believe it is in the long-term economic interest of all rainforest countries to do that. We want to plant gazillions of trees, hundreds of millions of hectares. ""We want a global process of reforestation.

609,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson plans to press Amazon boss Jeff Bezos on the tech giant's tax record when the pair meet face to face in New York on Monday, Downing Street has said. The prime minister will meet Bezos as part of a three-day trip to New York and Washington, where Johnson will address the UN general assembly and hold talks with the US president, Joe Biden, and his deputy, Kamala Harris, at the White House.  After setting out contingency plans for coping with Covid in England this winter, and conducting a ruthless reshuffle of his top team, Johnson hopes to switch the focus to the global agenda on his first trip outside the UK since the beginning of the pandemic. Amazon, which made Bezos – its founder and former chief executive who is now its executive chairman – a multibillionaire, has faced persistent questions over whether it pays its fair share of tax, as well as the terms and conditions faced by its workforce. It was recently revealed that Amazon's revenues in the UK increased by more than 50% in 2020 to £20.63bn, but its key UK division paid just £18.3m in direct taxes. Bezos made a brief journey into space in his rocket New Shepard earlier this year, as part of what has been dubbed the ""billionaires' space race"", with other super-rich men including Tesla's Elon Musk developing their own rival space vehicles. Asked whether Johnson would raise Amazon's tax record with Bezos, the prime minister's official spokesperson said: ""Yes, you can expect the prime minister to raise this important issue."" ""As you know, we've been a leading advocate for an international solution to the tax challenges posed by the digitalisation of the economy,"" the spokesperson said, adding: ""We secured an agreement at the G7 on digital tax, so we'll very much be looking to raise that."" With Biden a strong advocate of a more robust approach to taxing corporations, the move may be partly aimed at emphasising Johnson's reforming credentials before the important White House trip. Johnson is also expected to press Biden to lift the travel ban that prevents most passengers from the UK visiting the US. The two countries established a working group three months ago to work on opening up travel, but no proposals have yet emerged from it. England will substantially loosen travel restrictions next month, replacing the three-tier traffic light system with two levels, and easing testing requirements for double-vaccinated passengers returning from non-red list countries. Also on the agenda as world leaders meet in New York will be the west's hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan and how to handle the new Taliban government. Biden's arrival in the White House has spurred fresh global attempts at cooperation on tax, which had been blocked by Donald Trump. G7 leaders signed a historic agreement at June's summit in Cornwall aimed at tying the tax revenues of the biggest multinational tech firms more closely to the revenues they earn in each country, and setting a 15% minimum corporation tax rate. More than 130 countries have since signed up to the proposals, which are being overseen by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and aim to end a ""race to the bottom"" that has undermined corporate tax revenues by pitting countries against each other. However, the UK has attracted criticism over pushing for the financial sector to be exempt from the new system. Final details of how the new system will work are now being hammered out, with some countries, including low-tax Ireland, still reluctant to sign up. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, last year unilaterally imposed a 2% digital services tax on multinational tech firms – a levy that would be expected to lapse if a global deal is reached. Johnson will also discuss the climate crisis with Bezos, No 10 said. The Amazon founder believes his efforts at space exploration are part of the solution. ""We need to take all heavy industry, all polluting industry and move it into space, and keep Earth as this beautiful gem of a planet that it is,"" Bezos told the US broadcaster MSNBC in July. The prime minister hopes to use the trip to ""galvanise"" international action, with just weeks to go before the UK hosts the UN's critical Cop26 summit. The Cop26 chair, Alok Sharma, will travel with Johnson, as will the new foreign secretary, Liz Truss. After the G7 summit, Johnson faced criticism for failing to persuade fellow leaders to sign up to a specific end date for the use of coal, or a concrete plan to raise the $100bn (£73bn) in finance they have long promised, to help developing countries to transition away from polluting technologies and manage the impacts of extreme weather. The OECD published a report on Friday showing that the target would be missed by about $20bn. Downing Street said Johnson would use meetings on the sidelines of the UN general assembly this week to press for the $100bn promise to be honoured. As a down payment, the government is announcing that £550m of the £11.6bn the UK has set aside for climate finance over the next five years will go to developing countries.",Real Guardian,860.0

As the prime minister's reshuffle rolled on through its third day, Bethell was among a string of casualties among junior ministers.  The hereditary peer and nightclub entrepreneur was placed under investigation by the House of Lords standards committee in July after it emerged that he had sponsored a parliamentary pass for the former health secretary's lover, Gina Coladangelo. He has since become embroiled in legal action over his use of private emails. Bethell, who oversaw the award of Covid contracts, admitted to the practice but denied any wrongdoing, telling the Lords: ""I have read and signed the ministerial code and I seek to uphold it in everything I do."" Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, welcomed Bethell's departure, but said it should have come earlier. She tweeted: ""If Boris Johnson had any integrity he would have sacked him a long time ago. Bethell has used Ministerial Office and taxpayers' money to enrich his friends instead of serving the public and been dishonest about his private emails."" Hancock resigned after being caught on camera in a clinch with Coladangelo, whom he had known since the pair were at Oxford University more than two decades ago. Both she and Bethell were involved in Hancock's campaign for the Tory leadership in 2019. Johnson's reshuffle began on Wednesday with a brutal clearout of cabinet ministers deemed to have underperformed, including the gaffe-prone Gavin Williamson. Dominic Raab was pushed aside as foreign secretary in favour of Liz Truss, though with the title of deputy prime minister, formalising the fact that he stands in for Johnson – at prime minister's questions, for example – when he is away. Johnson gathered his new cabinet for the first time on Friday morning – without masks – and gave them what he called a ""half-time pep talk"", stressing the need to deliver on their promises and ""level up"" the country. The shake-up was still rolling through Friday, with the junior ranks being filled. Appointments included the Norfolk MP George Freeman as the minister for science, research and innovation in the business department, and Lewes MP Maria Caulfield as a junior health minister. Johnson sacked a number of longstanding middle-ranking ministers including John Whittingdale from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport and Nick Gibb from the Department for Education, promoting younger loyalists in their place. The most junior jobs – parliamentary private secretaries or PPS – are expected to be handed out over the weekend, with many of the 2019 intake of MPs hoping to receive a call.",Real Guardian,447.0
611,Real,The Guardian,"Keir Starmer is committed to debating plans for a green new deal at Labour's conference later this month, his team have insisted, despite the party having rejected a grassroots motion on the issue. Labour sources said the need to transform the economy to meet the climate challenge and create green jobs in the UK would be a key theme in Starmer's conference speech, and in a lengthy essay for the Fabian Society he is due to publish in the run-up to the conference in Brighton.  During last year's Labour leadership campaign, Starmer wrote: ""We need a green new deal hardwired into every level of government,"" but some green activists are concerned about whether the leadership remains committed to the policy. The frontbenchers Rachael Maskell and Olivia Blake, and backbench MPs including the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, have joined those calling on the party to reverse a decision to rule out of order a conference motion calling for Labour to endorse a green new deal. The row blew up as it was announced that McDonnell would be joined by video link at The World Transformed, the leftwing conference fringe, by the former US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. McDonnell said he and Sanders would discuss the progress of the ""new left"" on both sides of the Atlantic, including ""the struggles of socialists and progressives within the Labour party and Democratic party"", underlining fears that The World Transformed could become a focal point for leftwing opposition to Starmer's leadership. Jeremy Corbyn, who remains a Labour member though he has been stripped of the party whip, is expected to address a series of fringe meetings in Brighton. Labour insists the green new deal motion, passed by 21 local parties and endorsed by the leftwing Momentum campaign group, was rejected because it was too broadly drawn, bringing in policies such as universal free broadband. Some party figures see it as an attempt to shoehorn parts of Jeremy Corbyn's 2019 manifesto into Labour policy. But Blake, who is Labour's shadow minister for nature, tweeted: ""You can't draw lines around the climate emergency – our response to it should thread through all the work we do."" She added that she hoped the decision by Labour's conference arrangements committee would be reversed. Chris Saltmarsh, a co-founder of the internal pressure group Labour for a Green New Deal, said: ""The idea that this motion covers more than one subject makes a mockery of the idea of a joined-up response to climate change. ""Labour's leadership have revealed they have little understanding of the idea that responding to climate change requires action across sectors.""",Real Guardian,435.0
612,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson is continuing to reshuffle his government, sacking longstanding ministers in moves expected to make way for ambitious younger MPs. The media minister, John Whittingdale, and the veteran schools minister, Nick Gibb, first appointed to the education department by David Cameron, have both been removed.  Whittingdale tweeted that he was sorry to be stepping down, and sad to say goodbye to officials. Neither man's replacement has yet been named, but Downing Street sources have made clear the prime minister is keen to refresh the government with MPs who have arrived in the House of Commons more recently. Junior ministerial appointments continue to be announced, as the reshuffle rolls into its second day. Penny Mordaunt – a staunch Brexiter, popular among backbench colleagues – has been moved from the Treasury to be minister of state at the Department for International Trade, under its new boss Anne-Marie Trevelyan. In a wide-ranging reshuffle of the cabinet on Wednesday, Gavin Williamson was fired as education secretary after his handling of the exams fiasco during the coronavirus crisis, while Robert Buckland lost his job as justice secretary. Buckland was replaced by Dominic Raab, who was demoted from foreign secretary after widespread criticism of his handling of the Afghanistan crisis, during which he was on holiday in Crete while Kabul was falling to the Taliban. Liz Truss succeeded him as foreign secretary, the first time a woman has held the post in more than a decade. Oliver Dowden was replaced as culture secretary by Nadine Dorries, and he instead was made the Tory party co-chairman before quickly readying Conservative staff for the next general election which is expected to take place in 2024, or potentially earlier. ""You can't fatten a pig on market day,"" he was understood to have said. ""It's time to go to our offices and prepare for the next election."" Michael Gove succeeded a sacked Robert Jenrick as housing secretary and was entrusted with a further key position in the post-coronavirus agenda by taking responsibility for ""levelling up"". On Thursday the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, who remained in his role in the reshuffle, has said Boris Johnson did not sack or demote MPs from the cabinet because of their incompetence. Wallace said characterisations of Williamson, who was sacked as education secretary, have been ""unfair"" and said Raab was not demoted from foreign secretary because he was holidaying while Kabul was falling to Afghanistan. Wallace told BBC Breakfast the prime minister had removed people from government ""not because they're incompetent, not because they weren't loyal enough"" but because he had to ""refresh his team"". Wallace said of Raab: ""Dominic is by trade a lawyer, he started his life in the Foreign Office as a human rights lawyer and he's gone to the Ministry of Justice, which is actually a very, very important role and a role he desperately understands."" Wallace also said that improving women's representation in the cabinet was key in Johnson's thinking. Speaking on Sky News, he said: ""The prime minister wanted to bring forward a number of women MPs, he's determined to both level up not only in the country but also in my party's representation around the cabinet table."" He defended the appointment of Nadine Dorries as secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport, saying: ""I think Nadine Dorries is actually a bestselling author … She's sold thousands and thousands of books and now if that isn't part of culture, media and sport, I don't know. ""What's great about Nadine Dorries is she produces culture that people buy and actually want to see rather than some of the more crackpot schemes we've seen being funded in the past by taxpayers' money.""

Wilshaw told Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think it's really important we shouldn't underestimate the damage and disruption that Covid caused to schools, teachers and students. ""The new secretary of state has a big job on his hands to stabilise the education system and restore confidence amongst head teachers and teaching staff, which has been badly damaged. ""He's got to be a powerful voice in cabinet. When I was a head teacher, I was inspired by strong secretaries of state.""

613,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson has laid the groundwork for the next general election with a ruthless cabinet reshuffle, designed to clear out failing ministers and hand Michael Gove the key job of making ""levelling up"" a reality for sceptical voters. On a day of dramatic developments in Westminster, Johnson sacked three cabinet ministers including the gaffe-prone education secretary Gavin Williamson, and shifted Dominic Raab from the Foreign Office to the Ministry of Justice. Liz Truss, the media-savvy darling of Conservative grassroots members and champion of free markets, will replace Raab as foreign secretary.  Johnson kicked off the reshuffle by inviting ministers set to be sacked or sidelined to his House of Commons office, as MPs began a debate called by Labour over the £20-a-week cut to universal credit coming into effect next month. Williamson had been widely expected to be offered an alternative role – perhaps his old post as chief whip – but was instead dispatched straight to the backbenches. Raab managed to wrest the consolation title of deputy prime minister from Johnson after fraught negotiations but the move to justice secretary was widely seen as punishment for his role in the chaotic evacuation from Afghanistan last month. No 10 also appeared to signal its determination to continue prosecuting the culture wars, with the surprise appointment of Nadine Dorries as culture secretary. Dorries is a longstanding and vehement critic of the BBC, arguing against the continuation of the licence fee and labelling it institutionally skewed. In 2018 she called it ""a biased leftwing organisation which is seriously failing in its political representation, from the top down"". Downing Street sources insisted the former I'm a Celebrity contestant had not been put in place to pursue an ""anti-woke"" agenda, describing her as a ""rising star"" who could communicate well with the public and who had been consistently loyal to the prime minister. In the Department for Education, Williamson will be replaced by Nadhim Zahawi, an Iraqi-born entrepreneur who arrived in the UK as a child speaking no English. Zahawi is viewed as a safe pair of hands in Downing Street after his management of the Covid vaccination programme. Gove emerged from the reshuffle as the secretary of state of the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) with responsibility for enacting Johnson's levelling-up agenda across government. In July, the prime minister gave a speech on levelling up that was widely derided as lacking in concrete policies, and Tory MPs in so-called ""red wall"" seats are anxious about whether they can make good on their promises to former Labour voters. Gove will also have the job of defusing the row over radical planning reforms, which have sparked a backlash in traditional Tory seats like his own in Surrey Heath. He will also remain in charge of protecting the union and fighting elections. Johnson's official spokesperson said the reshuffle was the second part of the plan to relaunch government strategy following the winter plan for Covid announced on Tuesday. ""The PM set out his plan for managing Covid during the autumn and winter,"" he said. ""But the government must also redouble our efforts to deliver on the people's priorities. The PM will be appointing ministers [on Wednesday] afternoon with a focus on uniting and levelling up the whole country."" Gove will take on the role from Robert Jenrick, who was an unexpected victim of Johnson's removal of unpopular ministers. Ryan Shorthouse, chief executive of the Conservative thinktank Bright Blue, said Johnson appeared to be ""rewarding those who are good at publicity and removing those that have had overwhelmingly negative or no media for their work. ""Raab has been demoted for Afghanistan. Williamson departs because of exams and assessment. Jenrick for planning reforms. Buckland for relative silence,"" he said. Robert Buckland, the former justice secretary who was moved aside to make room for Raab, stressed in his resignation letter that the justice system was suffering from ""years of underfunding"". ""Justice is beyond price, and as a government we should always be prepared to invest in it,"" he said. Oliver Dowden, who is trusted by Downing Street, has been given the job of overhauling the Tories' election-fighting machine as party co-chair after recent byelection defeats in Chesham and Amersham and Batley and Spen. Several high-profile ministers who had been tipped for a move, including the home secretary, Priti Patel, the leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, and the Welsh secretary, Simon Hart, will remain in their posts. Patel's allies had signalled in advance that she would resist any attempt to move her into a less prominent role. Johnson frequently touts her tough-on-crime stance – joking at a recent lunch for business donors that she was turning the UK into ""the Saudi Arabia of penal policy"". The wide-ranging reshuffle barely improved the gender balance in Johnson's cabinet, with the number of women increasing from six to seven. However, with more junior posts to be filled on Thursday, Downing Street sources insisted the full picture would look more balanced. The junior education minister Michelle Donelan was being tipped for promotion to a new role covering skills, which could see her given the opportunity to attend cabinet, modestly boosting diversity.",Real Guardian,863.0
614,Real,The Guardian,"Twelve months ago, as a battle raged in Downing Street over whether to order a circuit-breaker lockdown, Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance issued a stern public warning that England was headed for 200 deaths a day by November unless action was taken. That was widely seen as a shocking and unacceptable figure. In the event, Boris Johnson finally caved in to the inevitable six weeks later, on 31 October, ordering a month-long lockdown.  When Whitty and Vallance gave that ominous press conference, daily deaths from the virus were running at fewer than 30. As Johnson set out this year's autumn and winter plan on Tuesday, the number of deaths had been consistently above 100 for more than three weeks, with little public outcry or political comment. That public quiescence is part of the reason the government feels emboldened to press ahead with what it calls plan A – booster jabs for the over-50s, vaccinating 12- to 15-year-olds and advising the public to be cautious – rather than taking tougher action now. Johnson acknowledged that measured on cases, hospitalisations and deaths, the situation is worse than in 2020; but insisted high vaccination rates meant the country was ""incomparably better placed"" to weather the winter ahead than it was last year. Indeed, despite some of the alarming data, Johnson and his No 10 team remain relatively optimistic. Their decision to press ahead with a ""big bang"" reopening back in July was widely viewed as a gamble – and derided as ""reckless"" by Labour – but cautious public behaviour helped contain the ensuing upsurge in cases to well below the 100,000 a day Sajid Javid had suggested was possible. Johnson and other ministers now recite their favourite new attack line at every opportunity: ""If it was up to Keir Starmer we'd still be in lockdown."" That helps to explain why, as at so many other moments throughout the pandemic, instead of taking a precautionary approach, the government now prefers to hold tougher measures in reserve. As the prime minister put it: ""We are now sticking with our strategy: in essence, we're going to keep going."" Downing Street insiders have also been buoyed up by advice suggesting that, with protection from the vaccine now high, modest changes well short of a lockdown could make a big difference – and by evidence that the savvy public adjusts their behaviour smartly when advised to do so. Johnson's deeply held scepticism about restrictions on daily life is also part of the picture. He is both ideologically wary of curbs on the public's liberty, and – according to Dominic Cummings at least – even unconvinced of the evidence that lockdowns work. Certainly, when asked about whether the government could reimpose working from home advice at Tuesday's press conference, for example – one of the interventions suggested by Sage advisers – the prime minister warmly stressed the advantages of the return to the office and the ""social capital"" it brings. In his opening statement, he boasted that England now has ""one of the most free societies and one of the most open economies in Europe"". But as the document published alongside Tuesday's announcement made clear, the government is well aware it may need to take action if the situation deteriorates – with the clinching factor, as last year, being whether the NHS risks being overwhelmed. As well as setting out a smörgåsbord of contingency measures, including making masks mandatory and imposing compulsory vaccine passports, the autumn and winter plan repeatedly stresses the potential challenges ahead. ""There remains considerable uncertainty and scenarios which place the NHS under extreme and unsustainable pressure remain plausible,"" it says at one point. At another: ""The nature of the virus means it is not possible to give guarantees."" It makes clear the criteria the government will use to make that decision, with hospital admissions the key metric alongside other measures including vaccine effectiveness and the link between hospitalisations and deaths. All this makes it a blunter and more revealing document than plans the government has published at earlier stages of the crisis, suggesting thinking inside government has moved on significantly in the past 12 months. Yet in other ways the dynamic remains strikingly reminiscent of a year ago, when Whitty and Vallance took to the airwaves: the experts warning of a rough winter ahead, and the prime minister clinging doggedly to plan A – for the time being at least.",Real Guardian,738.0

He conceded that mask-wearing and vaccine passports for crowded venues could be introduced if necessary – as well as ""communicating clearly and urgently to the public the need for caution"". But he did not mention lockdowns, as he informed the MPs of what he called his ""plan A"" for managing the virus, ""without the need for stringent economic and social restrictions"". ""We must be vigilant,"" he told MPs. More details of the government's contingency measures have been set out in a document published alongside Javid's statement, including plans for vaccine passports. The prime minister announced in July that it would be compulsory to prove vaccination status before entering nightclubs and other crowded venues. The government has since backed away from the plan after a backlash from Tory MPs, but Javid confirmed it was being held in reserve. The document says vaccine passports would be applied to all nightclubs; all indoor, crowded settings with 500 or more people such as music venues; all outdoor settings with 4,000 or more people such as festivals; and any venue with 10,000 or more people, such as big sports matches. It acknowledges the plans may need to be implemented at short notice – and encourages businesses to introduce vaccine passports voluntarily. The document also includes advice to the public about how they should behave as winter approaches. They are urged to meet outdoors where possible, keep windows open when meeting indoors, and think twice about activities such as singing or dancing. ""In general, the risk of catching or passing on Covid-19 is higher in crowded spaces (where there are more people who might be infectious) and in enclosed indoor spaces (where there is limited fresh air),"" the document says. ""Some activities, such as singing, dancing and exercising can also increase the risk of transmission of Covid-19 as people are doing activities which generate more particles as they breathe. The risk is greatest where these factors overlap."" The public are also cautioned to ""wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed settings"" – advice taken by very few of the Conservative MPs sitting behind Javid in a busy Commons chamber as he spoke. The government also pointedly refuses to rule out imposing a fresh lockdown. ""While the government expects that, with strong engagement from the public and businesses, these contingency measures should be sufficient to reverse a resurgence in autumn or winter, the nature of the virus means it is not possible to give guarantees,"" the plan says. ""The government remains committed to taking whatever action is necessary to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed but more harmful economic and social restrictions would only be considered as a last resort."" Plan B would be invoked, the document says, ""if the data suggests the NHS is likely to come under unsustainable pressure"". Javid said 81% of people over 16 had received two doses of Covid vaccination, and the link between infections, hospitalisation and deaths had been ""weakened significantly"", so that deaths from the current wave had been ""mercifully low"". He said the government's plan A included five pillars: renewing efforts to maximise vaccine uptake and expanding it to 12- to 15-year-olds; maintaining the test-and-trace system, including encouraging regular asymptomatic testing; boosting funding for the NHS and social care; encouraging people to modify their behaviour, such as meeting outside; and cooperating with international partners. Javid also confirmed the government would publish a new framework for international travel before the end of this month. Earlier, the government's health advisers announced their recommendation that booster jabs be delivered to the over-50s and younger people with underlying health conditions that make them vulnerable to the virus. Javid confirmed he would take that advice. Children aged between 12 and 15 will also be offered one dose of the Pfizer vaccine, as recommended by the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, and his colleagues. Javid also said it was ""highly likely"", that vaccination would be made compulsory for frontline NHS workers.",Real Guardian,732.0
616,Real,The Guardian,"Labour is warning that Rishi Sunak will be personally responsible for the largest benefit cut in the history of the welfare state, if the £20-a-week reduction in universal credit goes ahead next month. The shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, urged the chancellor to heed the warnings of charities, anti-poverty campaigners and six former work and pensions secretaries and reverse the planned cut, which will affect almost 6m households.  ""I'm trying to get across to people the scale of this,"" he told the Guardian. ""This is the biggest overnight cut to a benefit rate ever in the history of the welfare state. The House of Commons library tells me it's bigger than the cut to unemployment benefit in 1931, which collapsed the government. This is big money."" It is understood the work and pensions secretary, Thérèse Coffey, is concerned about UC going back to pre-pandemic levels, but the Treasury has repeatedly warned that cancelling the reduction would require tax increases. Reynolds said: ""Rishi Sunak has to understand the impact of what he is doing here. It's a personal decision from him."" With the labour market looking stronger than expected, he said Sunak could have found the resources for a change of policy. ""We're now getting the forecasts for the October spending review, and we know spending and government borrowing costs are coming in lower than expected, and they've got the fiscal headroom to do this,"" he said, adding that the structure of UC meant that the cost of it would automatically fall as wages recovered. Labour will force a symbolic vote on the issue in the House of Commons on Wednesday, although none is formally needed for the government to implement the policy. Reynolds urged Conservative MPs – more than 50 of whom have expressed concern about the policy – to send the government the strongest possible message by joining Labour in the voting lobbies. ""This is the only moment – that is the message to them. They need to make their views clear,"" he said. ""Look at it on its merits: look at the impact that it will have. The impact on family budgets, the impact on poverty – and also the impact on the economy of taking that spending away."" He cited a visit to Peterborough earlier this week, a Conservative-held seat where Labour analysis suggests the cut will affect 37% of families, sucking £19m out of the local economy. Reynolds said the decision was also impossible to reconcile with Boris Johnson's claim to want to ""level up"" the UK. ""This is something that affects all parts of the country but there is a disproportionate hit to the north and the Midlands, just in terms of where current claimants are, the level of wages in those places. It's not a decision you can in any way square with any commitment to levelling up,"" he said. Reynolds added that the change would come as a ""double whammy"" to many families who would also be hit by the government's new 1.25-percentage-point health and social care levy. Labour has come under pressure since Johnson's announcement on Tuesday to say how it would fund improvements to the NHS and social care. Keir Starmer will tell Labour local government leaders on Saturday that the government could have paid for the changes by taxing landlords and those with significant financial wealth. ""The government act like there was no alternative but there clearly was,"" he will say. ""The money could have been raised by taxing the incomes of landlords, and those who buy and sell large quantities of financial assets, stocks and shares."" He will dismiss the government's plan as ""a rushed out, half-baked, mess"".",Real Guardian,612.0
617,Real,The Guardian,"Labour is considering taxing wealth more heavily to raise funds in order to tackle the social care crisis, Keir Starmer has confirmed, as his party comes under pressure to set out its own costed plan. Labour has condemned the prime minister's plan for a 1.25 percentage point increase in national insurance contributions (NICs) as unfair – but has so far declined to say how it would raise the funds.  Announcing his proposal on Tuesday, Boris Johnson taunted Labour MPs, saying, ""plan beats no plan"". Asked for his alternative to the NICs rise, Starmer said, ""When it comes to funding it, I wouldn't look to working people and have a tax hike on them. I would say that those with the broadest shoulders should pay."" He added: ""Those that earn their income from things other than work, should pay their fair share."" Pressed on whether that could include a wealth tax, he said: ""People who earn their money from property, dividends, stocks, shares – capital gains tax, these should all be looked at as a broader, fairer way of raising taxes."" Asked again whether he favoured wealth taxes, he replied: ""I think we should look at all of these options."" Leftwing MP Richard Burgon has recently called for a 10% tax on the assets of the super-rich who have over £100m in wealth. Jeremy Corbyn's radical 2019 manifesto included a pledge to tax capital gains and dividends at ordinary income tax rates, narrowing the gap between the tax treatment of earned and unearned income. There was also a commitment to examine the idea of a land value tax, which could be levied on homeowners and businesses in proportion to the value of the property they own. The Conservatives responded to this idea by claiming Labour wanted to impose a tax on gardens. Starmer has come under pressure to say more about how Labour would fix the crumbling social care system. Some senior Labour figures have been dismayed at the party's lack of a fully worked-up proposal, despite widespread reports for several months that the Conservatives were about to produce their own. The Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, has said Labour should put forward its own proposal at its annual conference in Brighton later this month. Burnham, who worked on social care reform as Labour's health secretary a decade ago, said the annual conference, which kicks off in just over a fortnight, would be a good time to make the party's position clearer. ""I don't think the Labour party can come up instantly with its alternative to what the government announced … it needs to digest what the government has said, but I would like to see them do it soon – perhaps at conference,"" he told Sky News. ""We have a government plan here, I think they've gone down the wrong path because they've loaded the whole cost of social care on the shoulders of younger people, lower-paid people, people who have student debt, people struggling to get on the housing ladder, I don't think that's fair."" He added: ""There's an opportunity here for Labour to set out a much better alternative and I would say to them I think they should do that sooner rather than later, but the conference would be a good time to do that."" Burnham has said more money for social care should be raised through a 10% levy on estates, instead of a national insurance increase. When the plan was originally mooted after cross-party talks before the 2010 general election, the Conservatives called it a ""death tax"". Labour's annual conference will be Starmer's first opportunity to address party members en masse, and aides say he spent part of his summer holiday in Devon working on his speech. Johnson's health and social care plan was comfortably passed by MPs on Wednesday. Starmer whipped his MPs to vote against the plan – prompting Conservative MPs to claim Labour had rejected extra funding for the NHS and social care.",Real Guardian,661.0
618,Real,The Guardian,"The chancellor will decide what proportion of the £12bn annual proceeds from the health and social care levy will go to the NHS after 2025, legislation published by the government confirms. MPs approved the government's plan for a 1.25-percentage-point rise in national insurance contributions in a House of Commons vote on Wednesday, but full details of how it will operate were only published on Thursday, in a new health and social care levy bill.  The leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, announced that MPs would be asked to pass the legislation in a single day, next Tuesday. Just £5.4bn will go to the social care sector over the next three years – less than one pound in six of the revenue from the new tax. After that, the bill says the proceeds of the levy will be allocated ""in such shares as between health care and social care, and in such shares as between England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, as the Treasury may determine"". In practice, implementing the new £86,000 lifetime cap on social care costs, and a more generous system of means testing for patients with modest assets, will mean social care starts to absorb more of the revenue from the tax from autumn 2023. But the government has not published any modelling of how rapidly the proportion devoted to social care will rise – and the health secretary, Sajid Javid, has declined to set out any details. Social care leaders are concerned that the NHS will continue to absorb the vast majority of the proceeds from the new tax. Nadra Ahmed, the executive chairman of the National Care Association, which represents independent care operators, said: ""This is a recovery plan for the NHS and that is very obvious. The funding pot being talked about for social care is not sufficient to even address the issues of today."" The prime minister's official spokesman has insisted the proportion going to social care will increase over time, saying the NHS is currently facing a short-term ""bow wave"" of pressure, caused by the estimated 8 million people who did not come forward for treatment during the pandemic. But Javid has declined to say whether the backlog can be cleared in three years, and cutting NHS funding after 2025 could prove politically challenging. The Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank warned this week that ""an ever-growing NHS budget could swallow up all of this week's tax rise, leaving little for social care"". The Treasury has traditionally resisted the process of legally ringfencing the proceeds of a tax, but the government believes the new tax will make the increase more acceptable to voters. The care minister, Helen Whatley, was challenged about the issue in interviews on Thursday. She insisted extra resources were already going into the creaking social care system. ""Over the pandemic, an extra £6bn has gone to local authorities, which they have been able to use for social care. We have directed £2bn specifically into the extra infection control costs for social care during the pandemic,"" she said. ""We are directly actively supporting social care right now. But what this is about is those big reforms to social care that everyone has been calling for so long.""",Real Guardian,537.0
619,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson has confirmed his government will impose a manifesto-busting £12bn-a-year package of tax increases from next April to tackle NHS Covid backlogs and overhaul social care. The cabinet signed up on Tuesday morning to a controversial 1.25 percentage point increase in national insurance contributions, which will be levied on employers and employees.  Tax on share dividends will also be increased by 1.25 percentage points, in a move expected to raise £600m. Much of the revenue initially will be devoted to cutting waiting lists in the NHS, with social care receiving only £5.3bn of the £36bn expected to be raised over the next three years. From 2023-24, once HM Revenue's computer systems have been updated, the NICs increase will be rebadged as a health and social care levy, which will appear as a separate line on payslips. It will be extended at that point to cover pensioners who are still in work, and the proceeds hypothecated – put into a separate pot by law. Over time, a growing proportion of the revenue raised will go to social care, allowing the government to implement a new cap on total care costs, so that no individual will have to pay more than £86,000 over their lifetime. Anyone with under £100,000 in savings will receive some state help under the new system – with care funded completely by the state for those with less than £20,000. The prime minster said the plan would relieve people of the fear of ""financial ruin"" from ""catastrophic"" care costs. He told a Downing Street news conference that no Conservative government wanted to raise taxes but said the costs could not have been met through borrowing. ""Everyone knows in their bones that after everything we have spent to protect people through that crisis we cannot now shirk the challenge of putting the NHS back on its feet,"" Johnson said. While the new social care cap will apply only to patients in England, the levy will apply across the UK. The government said health services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would receive an extra £2.2bn a year. The leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees Mogg, announced that MPs will be given a vote on the proposals on Wednesday, with the government keen to secure the agreement of its backbenchers before the party conference season kicks off later this month. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, is expected to set out further details of how the money will be spent in the NHS and social care systems, which the government says will become more closely integrated. The money is intended to fund a further 9m procedures in the NHS, and allow the health service to operate at 110% of planned activity levels by 2023-24 in an effort to tackle the historic backlog of cases after the Covid crisis. Johnson acknowledged he was breaking the pledge made during the 2019 general election not to raise VAT, income tax or national insurance. ""It breaks a manifesto commitment, and I do not do that lightly; but a global pandemic was in no one's manifesto,"" he said. He said a white paper would be published later this year, with more details of how social care and the NHS will be more closely integrated, and the proposals would ensure that ""people get the care that they need, in the right place and at the right time"". Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests the tax increase, together with rises in corporation tax already announced by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will take the tax burden to its highest ever sustained level. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, responding to Johnson, claimed many of the problems in the NHS and care system had existed before the pandemic and accused him of ""putting a sticking plaster over a gaping wound"". The decision to break an explicit manifesto promise has sparked a backlash among Tory MPs, while Labour has pointed out the impact of NIC increases would be borne by younger, low-income workers. Johnson believes voters will accept the tax increase because of the backdrop of the pandemic. The government was keen to stress that the national insurance increase was progressive, hitting higher earners harder, and with more than 6 million of the lowest earners exempt. The decision to charge the levy to working people of pension age is aimed at addressing the perception that older people will not be paying their share. Conservative MPs could be asked to vote on the proposals as soon as this week, with the government keen to resolve it before the Commons breaks for the annual party conferences in a fortnight.",Real Guardian,771.0
620,Real,The Guardian,"The work and pensions secretary has announced the triple lock on the state pension will be temporarily suspended next year, to avoid the government having to hike payments by 8%. Thérèse Coffey told the House of Commons the state pension would increase either by 2.5% or inflation, whichever is higher, in April.  She said that sticking to the triple lock – which promises state pensions will rise by the highest of inflation, earnings or 2.5% – would be unfair, given that wages were increasing at a rate of well over 8% a year. Coffey said this was ""not a real-life basis"" for making a decision, given that wage inflation has been artificially boosted by the many thousands of workers coming off the furlough scheme and returning to the payroll, which she called a ""statistical anomaly"". She said the decision was ""fair and reasonable"" and that the triple lock would be restored after one year, and the government would implement the policy throughout the remainder of the parliament. The triple lock announcement – breaking an explicit manifesto promise – came on the same day as Boris Johnson confirmed national insurance contributions would increase by 1.5 percentage points to fund the NHS and social care. The triple lock was introduced by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government in 2010.

621,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson's former director of communications has blamed a lack of expertise in Whitehall for the government's struggle to get its message across in the early days of the Covid crisis. Lee Cain was a key adviser to Johnson, who boasted about shaking hands on a hospital visit, claimed the government could ""turn the tide"" within 12 weeks, and said it would be ""inhuman"" to cancel Christmas, days before ordering millions of people to spend the festive season at home.  But in a paper for the Institute for Government (IfG), the former Vote Leave staffer pointed to shortcomings in the government machine that he said led to ""mixed messages"". He called for an overhaul, including a drastic reduction in staff numbers. Cain claimed data visualisation skills were so lacking that there was ""nobody with the ability"" to create the slides for the daily Covid press conferences, fronted by the prime minister and watched by millions of people. ""Even when a system was designed, people struggled with the skills required and slides were often sent only moments before press conferences were due to begin,"" he said. Despite more than 4,000 communications staff being employed across the government, many departmental press offices are ""unable to conduct the most basic functions"", Cain said. ""Building constructive relationships with journalists, rebutting inaccurate stories and, in many cases, answering inquiries with anything other than an irrelevant agreed 'line to take' that fails to address the question. These are all critical requirements that go unfulfilled."" Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, accused Cain of trying to ""shift the blame"" on to the civil service. ""The fundamental problem with government communications is that the prime minister is serially dishonest, failed to take and communicate the decisions that were needed to save lives during the pandemic and his former senior adviser undermined public health messaging by embarking on a cross-country eye test to Barnard Castle,"" she said. ""An overhaul of government press offices is not and cannot be a replacement for what is needed – a prime minister that tells the truth and a government with coherent and effective policy."" Alex Thomas, a programme director at IfG, said: ""Even the best government communications team cannot obscure poor policy decisions or indecisive leadership."" Cain praised individual civil servants, describing those he worked with in No 10 as ""some of the most dedicated public servants I've ever had the pleasure to work alongside"". But he claims the pandemic exposed strains in a communications system ill equipped for the 21st century. He is scathing about the Covid communications hub created in Michael Gove's Cabinet Office at the height of the crisis, calling it ""a failure due to inexperienced staff and unclear lines of responsibility. Policy development was inconsistent and leaking endemic."" He and Dominic Cummings brought in external advisers – including the former Conservative election campaign chief Isaac Levido and their Vote Leave colleague Paul Stephenson – to help devise what became the ""stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives"" message. There was no coherent government presence on social media platforms at the start of the crisis, Cain said, with the Department of Health and Social Care, the Cabinet Office and Department for Transport releasing separate public health messages. ""New government-wide digital assets had to be created on platforms such as LinkedIn, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube for the launch of the stay home campaign to ensure people understood the messaging was directly from the government."" A UK government spokesperson said: ""These claims are misleading – throughout the pandemic we have set out clear, targeted and effective communications to help the public protect themselves, directly preventing millions of infections and saving thousands of lives."" Cain left government, alongside Cummings, after a row involving Johnson's wife, Carrie Symonds, over the appointment of Allegra Stratton to be the prime minister's new press secretary. Stratton has since been sidelined, and the live press briefings she was meant to be presenting abandoned, but Cain suggests the government should commit itself to holding regular televised press conferences. In the IfG paper he also recommends – as he did while in government – a dramatic reduction in the number of Whitehall communications staff, suggesting they should be employed centrally instead of by separate departments.",Real Guardian,706.0
622,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson is expected to make a final decision over the weekend about whether to press ahead with his controversial social care funding plan, in the face of a growing backlash from cabinet ministers and backbench MPs. One government source described ""chaos"" in a jittery Downing Street on Friday, after leaks about plans for an increase in national insurance contributions (NICs), including the contested claim that the health secretary, Sajid Javid, has been demanding a rise of two percentage points.  It is understood Johnson still hopes to announce the package next week, but several cabinet ministers are privately fuming about the idea of a manifesto-busting tax rise that will hit young adults on low incomes, but leave pensioners unscathed. Backbench Conservative MPs including Jeremy Hunt and John Redwood went public with their concerns about an NICs rise on Friday. Hunt told BBC Radio 4: ""Since older people are the biggest beneficiaries, it's fair they should make a contribution."" Another Conservative backbencher said Johnson could even struggle to get the measure through a restive House of Commons. ""People have been through enough, and we should focus on getting the economy going again. Yes, social care is a ticking timebomb, but does it have to be right now?"" They added: ""It just doesn't feel very Conservative, especially given the manifesto pledge."" Johnson's former chief aide Dominic Cummings waded into the row, calling an NICs increase ""bad policy and bad politics"". ""Why should young people on average and below-average incomes lose disposable income to pay for another subsidy for the older middle classes?"" Cummings asked, in the latest posting on his £10-a-month Substack site. He predicted Johnson could yet succumb to political pressure and ""trolley"" away from the plan. Another Conservative MP said he believed colleagues would reluctantly support the proposal, however. ""This is a tax rise, specifically on people who work, so MPs are massively torn, but most people will think, given the pressures on the NHS, let's just bloody do it,"" they said. Depending on the outcome of discussions about how much funding is needed, the proposal is expected to include an increase of 1 or 1.25 percentage points in NICs – badged as a ""health and social care levy"". For someone on average earnings of £29,536 a year, an increase of one percentage point would cost them £199.68 annually. The proceeds would be devoted to relieving Covid pressures on the NHS in the early years of the plan, with more resources flowing to social care as time goes on. The proposal is expected to include a lifetime cap on the costs an individual will have to pay towards their care, as originally recommended more than a decade ago by the Dilnot review, commissioned by David Cameron's government. Officials in Downing Street are said to be fretting that while the political costs of a tax increase will be high, even a 1.25-percentage-point rise will fail to fix the crisis in social care, or tackle the Covid backlog in the health service. One source suggested the prime minister had been angered by the suggestion that even after the tax rise, it could take a decade for the NHS to return to pre-pandemic performance. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is also expected to announce that he will not honour the ""triple lock"" for pensions this year, with wage increases, which pensions track, artificially boosted by the end of furlough. Sticking to the rule could mean an increase in the state pension of as much as 9% next April. Politically, hitting pensioners by ditching the triple lock for this year could act as a counterweight to the fact that they will be left unscathed by the NICs rise. With more than two years having elapsed since Johnson promised he had a plan ready to fix the social care system, the government is keen to have it announced and agreed by MPs in the brief, three-week sitting of the House of Commons before the annual party conferences.

623,Real,The Guardian,"Jeremy Corbyn will be granted a pass to Labour's conference in Brighton later this month and will be free to address fringe meetings despite currently sitting as an independent MP, a party spokesperson has said. The former leader, who had the whip suspended by Keir Starmer last year, has applied for a conference pass and accepted invitations to speak at several events, the Guardian understands.  Amid a growing row about whether Corbyn should be allowed to attend, a spokesperson said: ""He's definitely not barred: of course he will be getting a conference pass."" The last time Corbyn attended Labour conference in 2019 – also in Brighton – it was as party leader, when the event was curtailed after the supreme court struck down Boris Johnson's prorogation of parliament. Three months later, the party plunged to its worst electoral defeat since 1935. Starmer's team had faced a mounting backlash after the chair of Young Labour, Jess Barnard, complained she had been told Corbyn would not be allowed to speak at the group's conference event. Labour sources said the Young Labour event was a formal part of Labour conference, and as such the speakers would have to be vetted separately. But they confirmed Corbyn would be allowed to speak at fringe meetings in the conference centre, which do not form part of Labour's formal programme or take place on the main conference stage. Corbyn supporters had warned that rejecting his conference application would be a provocation by Starmer. ""He is a Labour member: he should be entitled to attend any meeting in the conference zone,"" said Richard Burgon, the Leeds East MP who chairs the Socialist Campaign Group of leftwing MPs. ""If the leadership decided to bar him from the conference, they would be doing so as a provocative act towards the membership, hoping that more leftwing members leave,"" he added. Corbyn will also be free to address events at the World Transformed event, which is taking place outside the formal conference zone. One senior party aide said the leadership had faced a ""lose-lose"" decision about whether to admit him to the main conference venue, raising the spectre of Boris Johnson's packed-out speech at Tory conference in 2018 during Theresa May's premiership. Corbyn had his membership of Labour restored last November by the party's ruling national executive committee (NEC), but Starmer has declined to restore the whip, meaning Corbyn now sits as an independent. Starmer told the Guardian last month that in order to be welcomed back into the fold, Corbyn would have to apologise for, and take down, comments made in the aftermath of the publication of the damning Equality and Human Rights Commission report on Labour's handling of antisemitism complaints. In a statement that remains online, Corbyn claimed the scale of antisemitism in Labour was ""dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party"". Starmer's team hope the first in-person conference since he was elected leader will be a showcase for Labour's values and policies. But a row had already erupted about Young Labour day, which was meant to form part of the usual conference schedule. Barnard has complained that Young Labour has not been given the support from the party's general secretary, David Evans, that it needed to hold an event, and was told it would not be allowed to have Corbyn as a speaker. The NEC recently agreed to proscribe four leftwing groups. Some MPs claim Starmer is carrying out a purge of Corbyn-supporting elements of the party, though the leadership say they are simply following through on their determination to root out antisemitism.",Real Guardian,601.0
624,Real,The Guardian,"Keir Starmer should invite the Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, and the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, to join a powerful new ""political cabinet"" to help Labour shape policy and get its message across to voters, according to a report by PR experts. ""Fit for the future"" published by a 1,200-strong network called Labour in Communications, urges Starmer to slim down the shadow cabinet and give a more prominent role to well-respected Labour leaders from around the UK.  The experts also call on Starmer to avoid reams of detailed policy in favour of a more pared-down offering that could ultimately be represented on a 1997-style ""pledge card"". ""Labour should look to restructure the shadow cabinet and communicate through a leaner group of members to improve the perception and awareness of Labour's shadow cabinet among the public,"" the report says, highlighting the low public profile and lack of government experience of some on the current frontbench. ""The grouping would effectively operate as a 'political cabinet' and would have sole responsibility, as Labour's dedicated spokespeople, to frame, develop and communicate Labour's message to the public,"" the report adds. ""Figures in power from across the Labour movement – such as Mark Drakeford, Andy Burnham, Sadiq Khan, Tracy Brabin and Steve Rotheram – should be invited to join the political cabinet and given the chance to influence the party's national strategy and decision-making."" Including Starmer, Labour's shadow cabinet currently has 34 members. The shadow cabinet has a formal standing under Labour's rulebook – but leaders have often taken advice from smaller groupings. At the height of the Covid-19 crisis, Starmer relied on regular meetings of an inner group, including senior figures such as Rachel Reeves and Nick Thomas-Symonds, to make key decisions – though Drakeford, Burnham and others would probably be too busy with their day-jobs to offer such intensive input. Burnham was re-elected as Manchester metro mayor with 67% of the vote in May. He became a prominent critic of the government's Covid policies at key moments during the pandemic, when much of the north-west of England faced stringent lockdown restrictions. He has not ruled out a return to Westminster and some Labour MPs believe he could be a future leadership candidate. With Starmer's first in-person conference speech looming later this month, Labour in Communications urge the Labour leader not to be tempted into setting out a long list of detailed policies or a sweeping political vision. ""All too often politicians feel like they have to set out what George HW Bush disparagingly called 'the vision thing': a West Wing-style speech setting out a political leader's core beliefs that can get voters' hearts going. Instead, what Keir Starmer should do is concentrate on answering a simple question: why are you in politics and what are you setting out to achieve?"" they say. In a foreword to the report, the former Labour leader Neil Kinnock says: ""Not for the first time, we have to rebuild, modernise our methods, restore relevance to our message, show that we have deep commitment to our country and communities and practical answers to the demands facing the British people"". Tony Blair's Labour party fought the 1997 general election with the aid of a five-point pledge card, featuring promises including cutting class sizes for five- to seven-year-olds, and cutting NHS waiting lists by treating an extra 100,000 patients.

625,Real,The Guardian,"Labour staff have put Keir Starmer on notice that any move to make compulsory redundancies as part of a drastic cost-cutting drive is likely to result in strike action. David Evans, the party's general secretary, told staff in July that the party's management were seeking at least 90 redundancies as they try to repair Labour finances after several costly legal battles and three general elections in six years.  Labour has said it will seek to make the cuts through voluntary redundancies, but the target represents well over a quarter of all the party's staff. Members of two unions representing Labour staff – GMB and Unite – announced on Tuesday that a majority of those consulted in an indicative ballot said they would support strike action if the party tries to impose compulsory redundancies. Among Unite members, 78% of staff on a 90% turnout said they would support a strike, while among GMB members the figure was 76% on a 79% turnout. The high turnout and decisive result appeared to point to significant discontent among party staff as Starmer and Evans bid to transform the party into a leaner, election-fighting force. In a joint statement, the two unions said they would meet Labour management on Friday and were hopeful ""an agreement can be reached on a way forward that avoids compulsory redundancies and industrial action"". The row comes at an acutely awkward moment for the Labour leadership, just weeks before Starmer's first in-person conference in Brighton, and with increasingly noisy rumblings of discontent among some MPs about the party's direction. One senior party source suggested the management would be likely to make concessions, rather than risk the embarrassing spectacle of a strike at conference where Labour is keen to be making pro-worker policy announcements. Starmer's deputy, Angela Rayner – a former union rep – is shadow secretary of state for the future of work and has stressed the importance of empowering trades unions. Labour paid a six-figure sum last year to seven former employees and a veteran BBC journalist, admitting it defamed them in the aftermath of a Panorama investigation into its handling of antisemitism. The party still faces several other legal claims that date back to Jeremy Corbyn's time as leader, adding to its financial woes. A hoped-for bounce in membership income has also failed to materialise. Labour membership surged in early 2020 in the run-up to Starmer's election as leader, but has been sliding since.

626,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson returned to the West Country on Sunday to spend several days with his family but Downing Street has said it is not a holiday and that he is ""continuing to work"". In a briefing to journalists, the prime minister's official spokesman said Johnson had travelled to the west of England on Sunday, and would be returning to No 10 on Thursday.  Asked repeatedly if the short break from Downing Street was a holiday, the spokesman said it was not. ""He's away from the office, but he's still working,"" he said. The prime minister had previously been criticised for deciding to head off on holiday in Somerset on Saturday 14 August, despite the perilous situation in Afghanistan, with the Taliban advancing rapidly. Johnson was forced to cut short that break after just a day, being pictured at Taunton station with aides on 15 August, before chairing a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee back in Downing Street later that day. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, also came under attack for choosing to go ahead with a holiday in Crete, before returning to tackle the crisis. Pressed on whether Johnson had felt free to leave his desk once the last UK personnel had been evacuated from Kabul on Sunday, his spokesman said: ""I wouldn't get into what dictates the prime minister's diary"". He repeated his insistence that the prime minister has ""full confidence,"" in Raab, who faces a grilling before members of the cross-party foreign affairs select committee on Wednesday about his role in the Kabul airlift. Johnson was last seen publicly in a video message recorded in Downing Street and published on Sunday, in which he thanked British troops for their ""heroic"" efforts in Afghanistan. The prime minister recalled MPs to Westminster earlier this month to update them on the evacuation, and faced harsh criticism from senior backbenchers in his party about failures of intelligence, strategy and planning. Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May, challenged him, saying: ""Did we just think we had to follow the United States and on a wing and a prayer it would be all right on the night?"" Johnson faces a series of pressing challenges in the weeks ahead, including whether to announce plans for a manifesto-busting tax increase to fund the NHS and social care.",Real Guardian,381.0
627,Real,The Guardian,"Downing Street has said the government will press ahead with plans to introduce vaccine passports for nightclubs and other crowded indoor venues in England from the end of next month. Boris Johnson's official spokesperson was asked on Tuesday about reports suggesting ministers could back away from the proposal in the face of objections from Conservative MPs, but said there was no change to the policy.  ""We set out broadly our intention to require vaccination for nightclubs and some other settings. We will be coming forward in the coming weeks with detail for that,"" he said. The requirement is meant to come into effect at the end of September and will be based on use of the existing NHS app, which allows users to generate proof of vaccination. Asked whether the prime minister remained 100% committed to the plan, the spokesperson said: ""Yes, there is no change in our position."" Johnson first put forward the idea in July, days after clubs and other venues were allowed to reopen. He said: ""We are planning to make full vaccination the condition of entry to nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather. Proof of a negative test will no longer be sufficient."" At the time, keen to encourage young people to get the jab, the government even refused to deny that pubs and other venues could be included; but Johnson's spokesperson said there were no plans to expand it to other venues. Ministers hoped barring vaccine-sceptics from busy nightspots would help to increase vaccine uptake among young people, but the plan prompted a backlash from Conservative backbenchers concerned about the impact on civil liberties. Labour has also expressed concerns, suggesting a system that included Covid testing alongside vaccination would be a better approach, since fully vaccinated individuals can still catch and pass on the virus. If Keir Starmer's party declined to support the vaccine passports plan, the government could face defeat in the House of Commons, with some Conservative rebels suggesting up to 40 colleagues would be willing to vote against it. Some backbenchers have also suggested they could boycott the Tory party conference in October if vaccination is made a condition of entry. The government has been targeting adverts and other media at young people over the summer, stressing the importance of the vaccine in returning life to normal. Johnson's spokesperson said: ""We continue to see good uptake among young people; we recognise there's more to do, and that's why we have targeted campaigns specifically aimed at that age group"".

628,Real,The Guardian,"Keir Starmer will be packing the laptop as well as the buckets and spades as he heads off to Devon for a family break later this month: aides say he plans to use the holiday to work on a first draft of his party conference speech. It will be the Labour leader's first address to the party faithful in person – last year's was delivered online from an empty arts centre in Doncaster – and both fans and detractors agree it will have to be the speech of his life.  Some believe it will be something of an ""autumn relaunch"" to convince the public that Labour is serious about winning power, although the party says it is more about Starmer being able to set out his vision properly after the disruption of Covid. But that phrase may set alarm bells ringing for those in the party who remember the days of Jeremy Corbyn and Ed Miliband attempting to reinvigorate their leaderships – providing an acknowledgement that Starmer's stewardship is still beset by challenges, both political and practical. Backbench MPs and some shadow cabinet members continue to gripe that they do not know what Starmer really stands for, or what his political project is. Meanwhile, he is laying off 90 staff in an effort to repair the party's tattered finances, and has lost or removed almost all of the tight-knit group of longstanding aides who came with him from the backbenches into the leader's office. The most recent departure is Chris Ward, Starmer's deputy chief of staff, who had worked with him since he first became an MP in 2015, wrote his speeches throughout, and prepped him for prime minister's questions. Some stalwarts remain, including the policy chief, Claire Ainsley. But the breakup of the ""gang of five"", as disgruntled backbenchers called his most powerful aides, has only intensified the sense of mystery among some colleagues about what makes the Labour leader tick. And as ever in the Labour party of recent years, internecine divisions are never far below the surface. A slew of announcements on workers' rights last week have helped to reassure some on the Labour left who feared Starmer planned to ditch Corbyn's radical 2019 manifesto wholesale, after appearing to endorse much of it during his leadership campaign. But the Corbynite campaign group Momentum and Labour's biggest donor, the Unite trade union, have criticised the decision to proscribe four leftwing Labour groups, meaning their members are automatically thrown out of the party. Starmer's team say banning small but vocal groups including Labour Against the Witchhunt followed from his determination to root out antisemitism. But Unite called it ""political machismo"" and Momentum claimed it feared one day also being proscribed. One party source blamed the clearout on ""factionalists"" in the leader's office, rather than Starmer, who has repeatedly underlined his determination to seek party unity. Meanwhile, without the draw of an impending leadership race or general election, party membership has declined by 120,000 from its peak under Corbyn, to 430,000. ""They're leaving in droves,"" claimed one senior party figure from the Corbyn era. ""There's no organising going on in any constituencies. There's no strategy, or programme, or project."" Labour insiders will be watching intently when the result of the ballot for Unite general secretary is announced on 26 August. The frontrunner, Steve Turner, has been pressing Starmer to stick to the Corbynite agenda, while the moderate challenger Gerard Coyne has said the union under his leadership would no longer be the ""backseat driver of the Labour party"". Meanwhile, before his family break, Starmer has been continuing his tour around the UK, meeting voters and setting out Labour's stall. He has sharpened his criticism of Boris Johnson, using a Guardian article to accuse him of being ""missing in action"" on the climate crisis and risking failure at the vital UN Cop26 talks due to be held in Scotland. Speaking to the FT, he vowed to ""turn the Labour party inside out"", urging activists to embrace Tony Blair's political legacy to help the UK's main opposition party win the next election. As well as workers' rights, crime is another policy area where Labour hopes to land some punches on Johnson, after years of cuts to public services and the criminal justice system. A third is the economy, where the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will become increasingly prominent as the party tries to build up its reputation for competence. Since taking on the post in May's fraught reshuffle, she has launched a ""buy British"" campaign that would mean a Labour government using its procurement muscle to support domestic businesses. Reeves's promotion was one of the few changes in what multiple party sources claim was initially envisaged as a wider reshuffle, following the local elections in May. Moves were slated for figures including Lisa Nandy, who at one point threatened to resign altogether, over a rocky weekend, as Angela Rayner believed she was being made the scapegoat for the loss of the Hartlepool byelection. Starmer then faced a tumultuous eight weeks, with some MPs touting potential leadership challengers, before the parliamentary labour party (PLP) was cheered by the victory of Kim Leadbeater, the sister of the murdered MP Jo Cox, in Batley and Spen.",Real Guardian,871.0
629,Real,The Guardian,"Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, has said her own experience as a care worker helped to convince her more flexible working could be a ""win-win"" for staff and employers. Speaking to the Guardian after announcing new policies last week on employment rights and flexible conditions, Rayner said she had helped negotiate family-friendly working when she was a trade union representative.  ""We were frontline manual workers, delivering 7am till 10pm care in people's homes. We introduced a flexible rota that worked for the staff, and we saw productivity go up. The wellbeing of the staff, as well as the outcome for the service user, was they had the same staff going in – and sickness levels went significantly down as well, so it saved money for the employer. It's a win-win,"" she said. ""Of course, not everything can be achieved in every single workplace, but there are flexible options I believe in every workplace. If an employer looks after the employees, the employees will look after the employer, and it's reciprocal,"" she added. Rayner announced this week that a Labour government would legislate to give companies an obligation to provide flexible conditions – including compressed hours, and accommodating caring responsibilities such as the school run – unless they can show it is unworkable. It was part of a package of measures, drawn up with the shadow workers' rights minister, Andy McDonald, that also included ensuring all employees gain rights from day one in a job. The plans have been welcomed by the Corbynite campaign group Momentum, and helped to assuage fears among some in the party that Starmer would ditch the radical 2019 manifesto wholesale. Speaking after a visit to a flexible working hub in Hull, Rayner said Labour's aim was nothing less than to achieve a ""cultural shift"" in the workplace. ""It's about changing the culture in our country. The whole emphasis to me is, yes there's individual nuggets in here, but it's about a cultural shift away from people being inflexible, and not looking for new and fresh ideas about how people can engage in the workplace,"" she said. Rayner shrugged off suggestions that she has been at loggerheads with Keir Starmer – or could even challenge him for the leadership, as some supporters had urged her to do before the Batley and Spen byelection earlier this month. ""Me and Keir have been working incredibly closely together since the start of the pandemic,"" she said, comparing the day when they were both elected in the depths of the first lockdown to ""an arranged marriage, almost, by telephone"". ""We bring different things to that leadership. And I think that works,"" she said, calling them ""yin and yang"". Labour's loss of the Hartlepool constituency in May sparked panic about Starmer's prospects of leading Labour to a general election victory, with some MPs quietly casting around for a candidate who could gather the 40 signatures necessary to mount a challenge. But his leadership has appeared more secure since the party held the Yorkshire seat of Batley and Spen. Rayner said she and Starmer had different approaches. ""You know, my style is more robust as people know: I'm more bombastic, in the way in which do things, I say it how I see it: and therefore I bring that freshness to the partnership."" ""Keir's very forensic, he's very intelligent. He's very passionate about making sure that the country is a better place,"" she said. Rayner has spoken in the past about growing up in poverty, and becoming a carer for her mother, who struggled with mental illness, from the age of 10. ""I like to think I overshare and Keir undershares,"" she said. ""If you look at Keir's background, it's not dissimilar for mine: he looked after his mum, I looked after my mum,"" she says. ""Keir wasn't from a privileged background"". Challenged about a dip in Labour's membership, Rayner said she was focused on voters. ""Of course we want to attract people to be members of the Labour party, but what we need to do is we need to attract voters as well. And what we're doing is we're speaking to the country: we're saying that actually we don't want to be an opposition, we want to be a government,"" she said. Labour is in the process of laying off up to 90 staff via voluntary redundancies, as Starmer seeks to repair the party's shattered finances after costly election battles and a string of legal cases. The former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott criticised Labour this week for simultaneously seeking to hire staff on six-month contracts to handle a backlog of complaints against members. ""So Keir will make Britain the best place to work – unless you work for Labour,"" Abbott tweeted. Rayner rejected that, highlighting the importance of ensuring the party is financially viable. ""We don't want to be making staff redundant. It's an awful situation but we can't lose a general election, like we did, and then not look at our organisation,"" she said. And she insisted the complaints-handling staff will not be on zero-hours contracts, but were being hired on ""a fixed-term contract for a specific piece of work"".

630,Real,The Guardian,"Pop-up vaccine centres are being set up at festivals, sporting events and even a circus in England this weekend, as the NHS bids to boost take-up among younger people. The latest official data shows that 60% of 18- to 25-year-olds have received at least one jab since all over-18s were invited to come forward for vaccination last month.  But ministers are concerned that demand among younger age groups appears to be levelling off, despite the threat of vaccine passports for venues such as nightclubs. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) believes perceived inconvenience may be one of the key factors deterring younger adults from taking up the offer of vaccination, and are setting up more pop-up sites to make it hassle-free. Members of the public visiting Circus Extreme in Halifax – or even just passing the circus big top – will be able to get vaccinated, as well as fans at Burnley FC and punters at Goodwood race course. Dr Nikki Kanani, GP and deputy lead for NHS England's vaccination programme, said: ""From festivals to farm shops, circus tents and stadiums, NHS teams are working hard to set up vaccine clinics at a huge range of popular locations, all with the aim of getting as many people vaccinated as possible."" Officials say they have been encouraged by the take up of existing drop-in vaccination centres, and will be monitoring the age breakdown of users, to establish whether they are successfully attracting the hardest to reach age-groups. The announcement earlier this month that the government plans to legislate to bar vaccine refuseniks from nightclubs was aimed partly at increasing the incentive for young people to come forward. It is unclear whether Boris Johnson will have enough support from MPs to implement the measure when the House of Commons returns from its summer recess, however – and several Tory MPs have said they would boycott the Conservative party conference rather than be forced to prove their vaccine status. As of 16 August, adults who have received both doses of the vaccine will also be allowed to skip quarantine after coming into close contact with someone who has Covid, marking another dividing line with those who have not been jabbed. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove suggested earlier this week that adults failing to get the vaccine were ""selfish"". But the government's messaging – carried in adverts online, on TV and on billboards – has mainly focused on the benefits of getting back to normal life.",Real Guardian,415.0
631,Real,The Guardian,"Labour has called for Boris Johnson to explain the existence of a secretive ""advisory board"" for wealthy Conservative donors who have received regular access to the prime minister and Rishi Sunak. The Financial Times reported that party chair Ben Elliot, charged with beefing up Tory fundraising efforts, had created the club for some of the party's most generous donors, some giving £250,000 a year or more.  The Conservative party confirmed the existence of the board, and the fact that its members meet with senior party figures for ""political updates"". News that the chancellor and prime minister have been holding discussions with super-rich donors comes as the government is facing a series of key decisions on tax and spending, including how to pay for rebuilding the creaking social care system. Elliot founded Quintessentially, a concierge service for the rich, as well as PR firm Hawthorn. The FT reported he had hosted a drinks party at one donor's home, at which Johnson was present. Mohamed Amersi, a businessman and Tory donor, told the paper the club was ""like the very elite Quintessentially clients membership: one needs to cough up £250,000 per annum or be a friend of Ben"". Labour party chair Anneliese Dodds said: ""This appears to be less of an advisory board than a means for a select group of elite donors to gain privileged access to the prime minister and the chancellor. ""The Conservative party needs to explain what access this group had, what they have used that access to lobby for, and why they think it's OK for there to be one rule for high-ranking Conservatives and another rule for everyone else."" A Conservative party spokesperson said: ""Donations are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them, and comply fully with the law. ""Fundraising is a legitimate part of the democratic process. The alternative is more taxpayer-funding of political campaigning, which would mean less money for frontline services like schools, police and hospitals."" Johnson was recently criticised for defying the House of Lords appointments commission by giving a peerage to Peter Cruddas, a former Conservative co-treasurer involved in a previous cash-for-access scandal. Cruddas resigned as Conservative co-treasurer in 2012 after the Sunday Times claimed he was offering access to the prime minister for up to £250,000. A year later Cruddas won £180,000 in damages in a libel action, although that was subsequently reduced to £50,000 after aspects of the original allegations were upheld when the paper appealed.",Real Guardian,412.0
632,Real,The Guardian,"Labour is calling on the Conservative party to pay back £580,000 of taxpayers' money spent by the government on polling, including testing public attitudes to Keir Starmer, at the height of the Covid crisis. Angela Rayner has written to the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, urging him to investigate the contract, which was awarded after the personal intervention of Boris Johnson's then chief adviser, Dominic Cummings.  Rayner said: ""Conservative ministers have abused taxpayers' money for their own party political interests and the Conservative party needs to repay this money immediately. ""Taxpayers' money is not the personal cashpoint of Tory ministers to do as they please with. We need a fully independent inquiry into how much taxpayers' money has been abused in this way and which rules were broken by the ministers and special advisers who authorised it."" Cummings phoned his former Vote Leave colleague Paul Stephenson, who also worked on the Tories' 2019 general election campaign, to ask if Stephenson's company, Hanbury Strategy, could carry out the work in March last year. As part of the polling contract, the company examined public attitudes to Starmer and London mayor Sadiq Khan. One proposal under discussion at the time was to hold joint press conferences with Johnson and Starmer, against the backdrop of concerns about compliance with lockdown, in particular among members of the public who mistrusted the Conservatives. The plan was rejected by Downing Street before it had even been mooted with Starmer's team, but Labour argues that by testing the public's attitude to the Labour leader and Khan, Hanbury was carrying out political work, which should never have been funded with taxpayers' money. Hanbury had previously been brought in to sift potential candidates to be special advisers in Johnson's government. Rayner has called on Case to investigate whether Johnson or cabinet office minister Michael Gove, the former chair of Vote Leave, were involved in awarding the contract – and whether other sums of public money were spent on political activities. The contract with Hanbury, to conduct opinion polls on the public's view of the government's Covid response, is subject to a legal challenge by the Good Law Project (GLP), which argues that it shows ""apparent bias"". Documents made public at a court hearing last Friday included an email sent on 20 March 2020, in which Cummings asked the most senior civil servant responsible for contracts to sign off the budget immediately, and that if ""anybody in CABOFF [the Cabinet Office] whines"", to tell them Cummings had ""ordered it"" from the prime minister. The Cabinet Office, which is defending the GLP's challenge, has insisted it acted lawfully, and that the polling was used to shape public health messaging at a critical time in the pandemic. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: ""We do not carry out party political polling."" They added that an independent review of cabinet office procurement had already been carried out last December by Nigel Boardman. A Hanbury spokesperson said the company agreed to do the work ""at extremely short notice"" although it involved reputational risk. They said: ""Our work contributed to what was a hugely successful public health communications campaign which undoubtedly prevented many deaths. For that reason, if we had to make the choice again we would still agree to step up and help in this time of crisis.""",Real Guardian,552.0
633,Real,The Guardian,"The Department of Health and Social Care has set aside up to £6bn to spend on disposable gloves over the next two years, underlining the huge expense of continuing to supply the NHS with personal protective equipment. The drive to secure PPE since the onset of the pandemic has led to rocketing prices, accusations of cronyism, and reports of forced labour being used to manufacture the products.  The independent National Audit Office found that the government had budgeted ""an unprecedented £15bn of taxpayers' money"" for PPE during 2020-21, during a ""chaotic"" procurement process. A ""framework agreement"", quietly published by the government online on Friday, suggested that ensuring frontline workers never again go without critical protections is likely to be costly. It states the value of the two-year contract for ""medical examination gloves and surgical gloves"" – which could be fulfilled by many different suppliers – is £6bn. DHSC sources said that figure was a cap, rather than a target, representing the maximum amount that could be spent over the lifetime of the contract. But the fact that this extraordinary sum is being set aside points to the intense cost pressures the NHS continues to face. Pre-pandemic, the most recent contract for two years' supply of gloves for the NHS – intended to cover 2020-22 – was worth £300m, a twentieth of the new tender. About 65% of the world's disposable gloves are produced in Malaysia, where there have been consistent reports of forced labour being used in factories. The shadow trade secretary, Emily Thornberry, has written to the health secretary, Sajid Javid, urging him to ensure none of the £6bn is spent with suppliers who mistreat workers. In a letter seen by the Guardian, Thornberry said: ""Throughout the pandemic, concerns have been raised over the alleged use of slave labour to make the hundreds of millions of gloves bought for our hospitals from Malaysia. ""Ministers have ignored repeated warnings and allegations against companies whose factories are still supplying the NHS today. ""Government controls have been exposed over the past two years as at best inadequate, and at worst nonexistent. If you are about to authorise £6bn in new spending on medical gloves over the next two years, surely now is finally the time to put proper controls alongside those contracts and ensure they are not going to suppliers in Malaysia that use slave labour."" Labour is demanding that potential suppliers list the factories from which the gloves will be sourced, and demonstrate they have been independently audited to show they comply with international standards on slave labour. The tender closes on 31 August. A government spokesperson said: ""Proper due diligence is carried out for all government contracts and all suppliers appointed to our frameworks must comply with the Labour Standards Assurance System, which upholds robust rules to prevent abuses of labour. ""All our suppliers are required to follow the highest legal and ethical standards and if they fail to do so, they are removed from consideration for future contracts."" The government was criticised last year for continuing to source gloves for the NHS from Top Glove, a Malaysian supplier previously accused of operating ""slave-like conditions"" in some of its factories. The firm has denied the allegations. Meanwhile, ministers have faced consistent accusations of cronyism, with many lucrative contracts going to firms boasting close contacts to senior government figures, including the former landlord of Matt Hancock's local pub, The Cock, who denied profiting from the personal contact. Government insiders said the publication of the formal tender – likely to be followed by others for critical products – marks the return of a more systematic approach to procurement. But it also signals that the impact of the pandemic on NHS costs is likely to continue. The NHS was given more than £60bn in extra funding in 2020-21 to cope with the pandemic, taking its total budget to more than £212bn. But some Whitehall officials expect Javid to have to bid for another funding boost before the year is out, as the health service struggles with the backlog in other cases created when the NHS was focused on treating Covid patients. A report produced for the government last year on the sector suggested the global market for PPE had ballooned by 300-400% as the pandemic hit, driven partly by its widespread use in settings such as workplaces. It also pointed to potential shortages of raw materials, including nitrile, used in the manufacture of surgical gloves. Boris Johnson's former chief adviser Dominic Cummings has repeatedly criticised the role of the DHSC in PPE procurement, claiming that early in the crisis, as frontline workers complained of inadequate supplies, it was a ""smoking ruin"".",Real Guardian,779.0
634,Real,The Guardian,"Keir Starmer's speechwriter and close aide Chris Ward has told colleagues he is leaving his post after six years, in the latest departure from the Labour leader's top team. Ward has been Starmer's deputy chief of staff since he won the Labour leadership last year, but has worked at Starmer's side since 2015, writing his speeches and helping to prepare him for appearances at prime minister's questions.  He was one of a close-knit group of senior advisers around Starmer known as the ""gang of five"" by backbench MPs. Of the five, only policy chief Claire Ainsley remains in post after a radical shake-up kicked off in the wake of the Hartlepool byelection defeat. Former director of communications Ben Nunn has left, political secretary Lady Jenny Chapman has become a frontbench spokesperson, and Morgan McSweeney will move to be elections chief. Ward was closely involved in Starmer's leadership bid, and had previously worked with him when Starmer was shadow Brexit secretary in Jeremy Corbyn's frontbench team, including on the ill-fated Brexit talks with Theresa May's government. It is understood Ward discussed his departure with Starmer earlier this week, in what friends said was an ""emotional"" conversation. Starmer said: ""Chris has worked with me for six years and has been brilliant throughout. I am very sad to see him go and hope that we will work together again at some point in the future."" Ward's departure will raise the question of who will write Starmer's crucial speech for Labour's conference in Brighton in September – the first he will have been able to deliver to a live audience. Starmer has faced questions from colleagues about his vision for the country as the pandemic abates, and the speech – which will follow a summer tour of the UK where he will meet voters – will be analysed intently. In a message to colleagues seen by the Guardian, Ward said: ""When I first met Keir in October 2015 it was as clear to me then, as it is now, that he will be a superb prime minister and leader of the Labour party. To be able to play a role in that journey has been an enormous privilege."" Starmer's new chief of staff Sam White, a former adviser to the former Labour chancellor Alistair Darling, is due to arrive in post next month. The Labour leader has made a string of other new appointments in recent weeks. Several of these, including acting director of communications Matthew Doyle, are veterans of the Blair years, raising questions on the left of the party about the direction of Starmer's political project. However, some of those concerns have been assuaged in recent days by the announcement of several radical labour market policies by Starmer's deputy, Angela Rayner, including the creation of a single class of worker, allowing all staff employment rights from day one of their job.",Real Guardian,480.0
635,Real,The Guardian,"Labour would legislate to make flexible working the default – including working from home or around the school-run – so that ""work fits around people's lives instead of dictating their lives"", Angela Rayner has announced. Employees already have the right to request flexible hours, but Labour says it would widen the definition of flexible working and give employers a legal responsibility to accommodate it unless they can show it is not workable.  Rayner said as well as flexible hours, such as four-day weeks, the new duty on employers would cover compressed hours and flexibility around caring duties, including taking children to school or caring for them during school holidays. ""Labour will make flexible working a force for good so that everyone is able to enjoy the benefits of flexible working, from a better work-life balance to less time commuting and more time with their family,"" Rayner said. ""The new normal after this pandemic must mean a new deal for all working people based on flexibility, security and strengthened rights at work,"" she added. Many white collar workers have been able to work from home during the pandemic, but Labour would like to see more flexibility extended to staff in other jobs. Rayner is also calling for an end to ""one-sided flexibility"", where employers are able to dictate hours to staff at very short notice. She said all employees should have predictable working hours and shift patterns so they can plan their lives. The new policy is the latest element of Labour's ""new deal for working people"" campaign, as Keir Starmer seeks to switch the focus from tackling the government over the pandemic, to bread-and-butter issues. Over the summer, the party also hopes to focus on crime, where Labour believes the government is vulnerable despite the prime minister announcing a new strategy this week. Party strategists have been encouraged by a recent narrowing in the Conservatives' poll lead. A Survation poll conducted last week put Boris Johnson's party on 39% with Labour just two percentage points behind, suggesting the ""vaccine bounce"" may have faded. The Conservatives' 2019 manifesto promised to make flexible working the default but the government has not yet brought forward any formal proposal to do so. Rayner secured the title of shadow secretary of state for the future of work in May's reshuffle, and has been working alongside frontbench colleague Andy McDonald, to draw up a list of pro-worker reforms, backed by trade unions. In an article on LabourList on Tuesday, McDonald said Labour was committed to repealing anti-union legislation, while Rayner is pressing for unions to be allowed access to all workers, including home workers. The pro-worker measures are helping to assuage the concerns of some Labour members who feared Starmer was preparing to lurch to the right politically.

636,Real,The Guardian,"Ministers will meet on Monday to sign off additional emergency testing sites for workplaces in England hit hard by the ""pingdemic"", so more workers can avoid the requirement to self-isolate for 10 days, amid warnings of mounting chaos across the economy. Refuse depots and police stations are among the sites being considered for testing centres as the Covid-O cabinet subcommittee meets to discuss how best to avoid disruption of key services by the huge number of people self-isolating due to notifications from the NHS Covid-19 app.  Several councils have said they are reducing bin collections to cope with the surge in staff staying home after coming into contact with a Covid sufferer. But local government insiders suggest the challenges are much wider, hitting social care and services such as libraries. One council leader said it was likely they would only be able to offer a skeleton service in some areas in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, business groups say member companies across sectors from retail to mining are having to shut down core operations because of staff absences. Unions are reportedly preparing to tell workers to ignore the government's exemption and stay at home anyway. Steve Hedley, senior assistant general secretary of the RMT, threatened to launch strike action over the scheme. ""Why should our people be infected with Covid? They are panicking and trying to force our workers back to work, where it's not safe,"" Hedley told the Daily Telegraph. ""We have discussed the possibility of taking action at a senior level, and I can say that nothing has been ruled out."" In a separate scheme, some named staff in critical sectors can be granted an exemption from self-isolation; but the system requires their employer to get the go-ahead from Whitehall civil servants, a process that some councils say is taking up to 72 hours. Ministers have repeatedly been forced to revisit their policy for exempting vital workers from self-isolation. It was initially intended to cover a small number of critical staff – but the government is now scrambling to establish up to 2,000 testing sites. These were first established in the food sector, and allow staff at a specific workplace to avoid quarantine if they are tested daily and found to be negative. Business groups including the CBI and manufacturers' group MakeUK are urging the government to bring forward the 16 August date on which quarantine is meant to be replaced by daily testing for people who have received two vaccine doses. The CBI's director of policy John Foster said: ""We need mass testing, not mass self-isolation, to tackle staff shortages."" He welcomed the daily testing regime, but said if the government believes it is safe, ""the next step must be to scale this up at pace"". No 10 sources insisted shifting the 16 August date was not on the agenda for Monday's meeting. Ministers' public statements in recent days have raised the possibility that it could even be moved back. The environment secretary, George Eustice, said on Friday that the government had only announced the date to give people ""some kind of indication"" of when rules may change, and added that it could still move ""in either direction"". No 10 sources insisted the government is still aiming at 16 August. A spokesperson for the Cabinet Office said: ""Self-isolation remains an essential tool in our national efforts to reduce the spread of Covid-19. We are working closely with businesses to help them understand how the exemption works and what to do if their staff are eligible.""",Real Guardian,588.0
637,Real,The Guardian,"Labour is to launch a ""new deal for working people"" this week, as Keir Starmer seeks to put creating more secure, better-paid jobs at the heart of his offer to voters. The world of work is one of two areas, together with tackling crime, where Starmer's team believe they have a distinctive offer and a strong line against Boris Johnson's government.  His deputy, Angela Rayner, will launch the programme on a visit to a social enterprise on Monday, where she will say Labour wants to see jobs that are a ""source of pride, security and dignity"" and which pay a ""proper wage that people can raise a family on"". Starmer's team has been cautious about announcing reams of new policy since he took over the party last spring, and even when they have done so, it has often been hard to get a hearing as the pandemic raged. The party hopes to bring together policies already announced, including a minimum wage of at least £10 an hour, a guarantee of work or training for young people, and a buy-British approach, intended to use government procurement to support employment. Announcing the programme, Starmer highlighted his background – his mother was a nurse, his father a toolmaker – and said a ""new deal for working people"" was necessary as the economy emerges from the Covid crisis. ""It often feels remote when politicians talk about this thing called the economy, but our economy is just the sum total of the work of the British people. If we create good work for everyone, we will all benefit. With Labour, we can make Britain the best place to work,"" he said. Rayner, Starmer and other shadow cabinet members are expected to announce new policies over the summer that fit into the theme of its new deal, in an effort to hammer home the fact that Labour is the party on the side of hard-working voters. The phrase ""new deal"" was originally used by Franklin D Roosevelt in the US to describe policies used to boost the economy after the Great Depression, but politicians have frequently appropriated it since. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown offered a new deal to the young unemployed in 1997 that involved jobs or training. Rayner secured the post of shadow secretary of state for the future of work in May's reshuffle. Part of the agreement she made with the leader's office at the time was that she would play a key role in developing party policy in this area.",Real Guardian,419.0
638,Real,The Guardian,"Sajid Javid has apologised for saying it was time to stop ""cowering"" from Covid, after an outcry from families bereaved by the virus. On Saturday, the health secretary said on Twitter that he had recovered from coronavirus – which he contracted despite having had two doses of the vaccine. ""Please – if you haven't yet – get your jab, as we learn to live with, rather than cower from, this virus,"" he said.  His use of the word ""cower"" led some to accuse him of failing to understand the concerns of those whose underlying conditions make them particularly vulnerable to the virus – or who have lost loved ones. On Sunday, after the campaign group Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice called the remark ""insensitive"" and urged Javid to meet them at the Covid memorial wall, he issued an apology and said he had deleted the tweet. ""I was expressing gratitude that the vaccines help us fight back as a society, but it was a poor choice of word and I sincerely apologise,"" Javid said. ""Like many, I have lost loved ones to this awful virus and would never minimise its impact."" Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice had written to the health secretary, saying the flippancy of his message ""betrays the sacrifice so many of our loved ones have made"". Labour joined condemnation of Javid's language. The shadow disabilities minister, Vicky Foxcroft, said: ""In the first and second waves more than 3 million people shielded at the request of the government. Most have been happy to do this as we know this has kept us safe. ""These people aren't cowering away from the virus, they are just trying to stay safe."" Javid's arrival as health secretary appeared to mark a more bullish phase in the government's management of the disease, in which ministers have pressed ahead with lifting almost all legal restrictions despite rapidly increasing cases. Within days of arriving in his post, after the departure of Matt Hancock, Javid claimed the lifting of restrictions would be ""irreversible"" and there was ""no going back"". The word ""irreversible"" has since disappeared from the government's messaging, however, amid careful monitoring of the impact of the ""exit wave"" as restrictions are lifted. New cases of the virus have declined, with Sunday's figure of 29,173 down almost 18% from the same day last week – though the impact of ""freedom day"", when nightclubs reopened and mass events went ahead – appears unlikely to have shown up in the figures yet. Javid tested positive for Covid on 17 July, prompting the prime minister and the chancellor to have to self-isolate. The pair initially sought to avoid quarantine, announcing they had been enrolled in a pilot programme allowing participants to be tested each day instead of staying at home. But that decision was reversed within hours after an outcry, including from Conservative backbenchers. Javid was meeting Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson to discuss issues including how to upgrade the creaking social care system, something the prime minister promised to ""fix"" when he arrived in Downing Street two years ago. The trio appeared to be closing in on a proposal that would mean a £50,000 cap on care costs for individual households would be paid for with a 1p increase in national insurance for both employers and their staff. But the announcement was pulled after the three key figures went into isolation, with a final decision expected to be made by the prime minister over the summer. Some cabinet ministers are wary of the idea of a national insurance increase, fearing it could be described as a ""tax on jobs"". The former permanent secretary to the Treasury Nick Macpherson told Times Radio on Sunday: ""National insurance is only paid by people who work and so this is effectively a tax on employment. It's a tax on jobs. And if you tax something more, generally, you'll get less of it. ""But there's also a distributional issue. National insurance is paid only by people who are below pension age. It's paid by young people who have taken a pretty big hit in recent years, what with tuition fees and the general stagnation in wages.""",Real Guardian,695.0
639,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson intends to mimic aspects of Tony Blair's political project in the hope of winning over more voters in former Labour heartlands, Downing Street sources have revealed. While the Conservatives' 2019-intake MPs are more likely to model themselves on Margaret Thatcher than the former Labour prime minister, No 10 insiders said Johnson had been studying Blair's approach.  Comparing Johnson's ""levelling up"" pledge to Blair's programme, a source said: ""We're going to do the thing that Tony Blair failed to do for the people who voted for him. We're going to energise the towns and regions that feel left behind: we're going to reach out to those places and improve people's life chances."" They cited plans for investment in skills and further education, as well as Johnson's cherished infrastructure projects. Echoing Blair's promise to create an ""opportunity society"", the source added: ""This is an opportunity-spreading government."" Despite the Tories having been in power for 11 years, Johnson's team hope to emerge from the pandemic emulating the upbeat mood music that was the backdrop to Blair's electoral successes – literally, in the case of the Things Can Only Get Better soundtrack to the 1997 campaign. However, there has been criticism from within his own party about what many MPs perceive as drift and indecision in Downing Street – and a lack of concrete policies. Winning the Hartlepool byelection in May cemented hopes in government that after smashing the ""red wall"" in the 2019 general election, there may be more gains to be made in the north-east and other Labour-held areas in a future national vote. Veterans of Labour's years in power were sceptical, however. Lord Mandelson, the former Hartlepool MP, who worked closely with Blair, said: ""A vintage Blair project is one that is properly conceived, planned and executed, not a wheeze lasting as long as it takes for the prime minister to lose interest."" Anand Menon, professor of politics at King's College London, said: ""You can see how 'levelling up' might have been a phrase that Tony Blair could have used … [But] I think the fundamental difference is that Blair set out practical measures and could be judged on their achievement."" As an example he pointed to Blair's ""tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime"" slogan, and measures such as antisocial behaviour orders and tougher punishment for persistent young offenders, as well as increased investment in children's services such as Sure Start centres. Dominic Cummings has ridiculed the ""levelling up"" slogan, saying it played badly with the public and was insisted on by Johnson, who was irked by reports suggesting he was the puppet of his powerful adviser. That account was backed up by a former No 10 insider, who said the phrase had not gone down well in a string of focus groups. ""In the north they said 'same old Tories, we don't believe it', and in the south they said 'they don't care about us – it sounds like moving money out of our constituency into someone else's.'"" David Cameron once liked to call himself the ""heir to Blair"" as he sought to detoxify his party on social issues. Johnson's brand of Conservatism is arguably less liberal, recently landing him in controversy over his initial refusal to back the England football team's decision to take the knee. Like Blair, who won three general elections for Labour, including the 1997 landslide, Johnson is a somewhat ambiguous figure in his own party, embraced for his electoral appeal rather than loved. Johnson's biographer, Andrew Gimson, told Politico's Playbook on Friday that as Johnson celebrates two years in power this weekend, ""he'll be pretty pleased because he's a bit like Tony Blair, oddly enough, with the wider public. He's having an unnaturally prolonged honeymoon. He's high in the polls and the Labour party have got terrible difficulties at the moment. I think Boris Johnson will think to himself: 'This is just the start – if I play my cards right, then I can win three more elections.",Real Guardian,668.0
640,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson faces a tight vote over plans to make Covid certificates compulsory for nightclubs, after Labour said it was prepared to vote against the proposal unless testing status was also accepted. The prime minister announced this week that the government planned to make it mandatory for members of the public to prove they had been double-jabbed before entering crowded indoor venues from the end of September.  The move, aimed at boosting vaccine takeup among younger adults over the summer, sparked a furious response from some Conservative MPs, who are expected to be joined in the no lobby by Labour. A spokesperson for the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said: ""We oppose the use of Covid vaccination status for everyday access to venues and services. It's costly, open to fraud and is impractical. ""Being double-jabbed doesn't prove you aren't carrying the virus. Testing for access to venues would be more efficient, and would give people and businesses more certainty."" With the Lib Dems also vehemently opposed to the plans, Labour's opposition could deprive the prime minister of his Commons majority, and make it impossible for the government to go ahead. At least 42 Tory MPs have signed a cross-party Big Brother Watch declaration against ""Covid status certification to deny individuals access to general services, businesses or jobs"" in recent months. It is understood that Labour would be keen to have mandatory testing introduced immediately. A Labour source said: ""We'll have to see what the government puts on the table, but we're saying if you go to a nightclub, there should be a testing policy, and that should be in place now."" Pointing to the case of the health secretary, who has received both doses of the vaccine but tested positive for Covid last weekend, the source added: ""Sajid Javid shows you cannot just rely on being double-jabbed."" Johnson unexpectedly announced the vaccine passport plan on Monday in a press release broadcast from Chequers, saying he had particular concerns about the risks posed by nightclubs. But the government has subsequently not ruled out introducing mandatory Covid passports for other crowded indoor venues such as pubs – something the prime minister said he was keen to avoid if possible. The government had previously backed away from the idea of compulsory Covid certificates, in part because of fears about lack of backbench support. The idea was examined by Michael Gove's Cabinet Office for several months, as part of one of the reviews launched when Johnson's Covid roadmap was announced in February. Showing testing status was originally envisaged as part of the plan – but Johnson said that once all adults had been offered the opportunity to have two jabs, it was reasonable to bar those who had not taken up the offer from crowded venues. ""I should serve notice now that by the end of September, when all over-18s will have had their chance to be double-jabbed, we are planning to make full vaccination the condition of entry to nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather,"" the prime minister said. Nightclubs were allowed to reopen on Monday – dubbed ""Freedom Day"" – as almost all Covid restrictions were lifted. But the government's language has become increasingly cautious in recent weeks in the face of rapidly rising cases and hospitalisations. Ministers have noticeably stopped using the word ""irreversible"" to describe the changes in recent days. Johnson's spokesperson insisted on Wednesday that hospitalisations remained within the range projected by the government's scientific advisers, but said the government would keep ""backstop measures"" in reserve in case the situation deteriorated.",Real Guardian,594.0
641,Real,The Guardian,"Labour's ruling national executive committee is to discuss plans for large-scale redundancies among staff, with at least 90 jobs at risk, as Keir Starmer seeks to repair the party's shattered finances. The Guardian understands NEC members will receive the findings of a report called Organise to Win, which has examined how best to restructure the party to approach future general elections.  Labour's general secretary David Evans hopes to achieve the planned cuts through a voluntary severance scheme – but 90 redundancies would amount to around a quarter of Labour staff. A Labour insider said: ""This is not an easy decision and we recognise it will be a very difficult time for staff and we will fully engage and consult with them and the trade unions throughout. We are reshaping our party's operation with a view towards being fighting fit for upcoming campaigns and the next general election."" Labour's finances have been hit hard by fighting three general elections in the past six years, as well as a string of costly legal cases, and hopes of a membership bounce after Starmer took over failed to materialise. The party paid out a six-figure sum a year ago to settle a case brought by seven former employees and a veteran BBC journalist, admitting it defamed them in the aftermath of a Panorama investigation into its handling of antisemitism. Labour's most recent annual report showed that 367 staff were employed by the party as at 31 December 2019, just after that year's general election, many of them at its Southside headquarters in Victoria. There have already been some layoffs among community organisers – the grassroots campaigners favoured by Corbyn, but regarded by sceptics as duplicating work done by existing local activists. Starmer is in the process of shaking up his own team, with a chief of staff and permanent director of communications yet to be recruited after a number of key departures. As well as discussing the redundancy plans at the meeting on Tuesday, the NEC will also be asked to approve proposals to proscribe four far-left factions from the party. The groups are accused of downplaying antisemitism, or harbouring members expelled for extreme views. Labour's biggest donor, the Unite trade union, attacked the plans on Monday, saying: ""While working-class communities are continuing to bear the brunt of the sickness and employment worries made much worse by Conservative mishandling of the pandemic, Labour is abandoning the field of battle against this government to turn its fire on its members instead."" The union added that such ""acts of political machismo"" create a ""sense of despair among voters who see a party at perpetual war with itself"". Starmer's predecessor Jeremy Corbyn remains suspended from sitting as a Labour MP, after appearing to downplay the scale of the problem of antisemitism when the Equalities and Human Rights Committee published its damning report on the issue. The groups affected by the proposed ban are Resist and Labour Against the Witchhunt which claim antisemitism allegations were politically motivated; the Labour In Exile Network, which expressly welcomes expelled or suspended members; and Socialist Appeal, a group that describes itself as a Marxist voice of Labour and youth. Starmer has a supportive majority on the NEC, so the plans are expected to be agreed. Anyone found to be a member of any of the four groups could then be automatically expelled from the Labour party. The plan has also been vehemently opposed by grassroots campaign group Momentum, set up to back Corbyn's leadership. ""We oppose guilt by association,"" Momentum said in a statement. ""The Labour party has always been home to a wide range of political traditions and we have a responsibility to work with each other to build support for socialist ideas and policies.""",Real Guardian,625.0
642,Real,The Guardian,"Vaccine passports will be compulsory to enter packed venues such as nightclubs in an extraordinary U-turn announced by Boris Johnson hours after clubs were allowed to open for the first time in 16 months. In a move that provoked an immediate backlash from Conservative backbenchers and the entertainment sector, the prime minister said that from late September, once all adults have had the chance to receive two jabs, Covid vaccine certificates would be made mandatory in England.  ""I should serve notice now that by the end of September, when all over-18s will have had their chance to be double-jabbed, we are planning to make full vaccination the condition of entry to nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather,"" he said. Unlike at pilot events, where customers have been allowed to show evidence of a negative test, they will have to prove they have been double-jabbed amid concerns in government about vaccine uptake among young people. Approximately 35% of 18- to 30-year-olds are unvaccinated, he said. Addressing younger people directly, Johnson said: ""Some of life's most important pleasures and opportunities are likely to be increasingly dependent on vaccination."" Less than 18 hours after almost all Covid restrictions were formally scrapped, allowing clubs to open and putting an end to mandatory masks and social distancing, the prime minister expressed concern about what he called the ""continuing risk posed by nightclubs"". From just after midnight on Sunday, thousands of revellers were pictured dancing at clubs across the country as they celebrated ""freedom day"". Johnson was delivering a press conference from Chequers, where he is self-isolating after contact with the health secretary, Sajid Javid, who has tested positive for Covid. The prime minister spoke alongside England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, and the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, both of whom struck a sombre tone about the challenges ahead. Vallance said hospitalisations could rise ""quite a lot higher"" than 1,000 a day as the lifting of restrictions allows more socialising, while Van-Tam repeatedly underlined the risks of unvaccinated people gathering in crowded indoor venues. Asked what would happen if the NHS struggles to cope over the summer, Van-Tam said the Scientific Advisory Committee on Emergencies (Sage) would have to make recommendations, which could focus on ""close contact indoors"". As ministers scramble to manage the fallout from surging Covid cases, Johnson also announced that ""a very small number of named, fully vaccinated, critical workers"" would be allowed to return to work after being ordered to self-isolate. These workers, in sectors such as the police, energy supply, food production and transport, will be allowed to leave quarantine, solely to work, if they take a negative PCR test and continue to have daily rapid tests. Their employer will have to consult with the relevant government department before allowing them to return. Conservative backbenchers were quick to criticise the new plans to make vaccine certificates compulsory for some venues. Former Brexit secretary David Davis said: ""Vaccination is sensible. But it is entirely wrong to try to coerce people into having them."" Mark Harper, a Tory MP and former chief whip who leads the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group, suggested the government could struggle to win support for the measures among other Conservatives in parliament. He said: ""I have to say I don't welcome the minister's statement, particularly vaccine passports for crowded venues, which is effectively moving to compulsory vaccination. I do however look forward to the debate and the vote in parliament when he will bring forward the evidence because I don't think that is supported by the pilots that have taken place."" Ministers had previously backed away from the compulsory use of coronavirus certificates – which involve customers using the NHS app to show their vaccination status – in part because of backbench Tory hostility. In a recent vote on compulsory vaccinations for care workers 31 Conservatives rebelled. Labour and the Liberal Democrats oppose the plans, raising the possibility that Conservative rebels could defeat them when they come to parliament in the autumn. Justin Madders, shadow health minister, said: ""This make-it-up-as-you-go-along government is causing more chaos when what people and businesses need is certainty. How can it be safe to go to nightclubs now, with no protective measures, if in September it will require double jab status? It makes no sense."" The Lib Dem home affairs spokesperson Alistair Carmichael said: ""Vaccine passports are Covid ID cards: unworkable, expensive and divisive."" Businesses reacted with fury. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said: ""What an absolute shambles … The government's own report into vaccine passports found they were more trouble than they're worth – so what could possibly explain the about-turn, just as millions across the UK experience their first taste of a night out in a year and a half?"" The latest survey from the Office for National Statistics, carried out in the month to 20 June, found that about 10% of all people aged 16-29 reported being hesitant to get the Covid vaccine, dropping to 5% for those aged 30-49 and 1% for over-50s.",Real Guardian,845.0
643,Real,The Guardian,"Downing Street is considering plans for a manifesto-breaking tax rise that would be earmarked to pay for fixing the social care system in England, according to Whitehall sources. One option being weighed up by ministers is an increase in either income tax or employee national insurance, which could be branded as a social care levy or precept.  The Conservative manifesto promised no increase in national insurance or income tax, but these are deemed the only taxes with a broad enough revenue base to raise the sums required. The concept of a social care precept already exists for council tax, with local authorities permitted by the Treasury to use it to raise money to fund the creaking system. Boris Johnson, the prime minister, claimed in 2019 that he had a plan to ""fix the crisis in social care once and for all"". No such plan has since emerged, but negotiations have been ongoing in recent weeks between Johnson, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the new health secretary, Sajid Javid, and meetings are expected to continue over the weekend. Several government sources insisted no final decision had yet been made and it was unclear whether an outcome would emerge before MPs leave Westminster for the summer recess next week. The current system, widely viewed as unfair, results in some families facing crippling costs of hundreds of thousands of pounds for a loved one to be cared for. Any deal between Johnson, Sunak and Javid is expected to be modelled on the decade-old Dilnot report, which proposed a lifetime cap on care costs of £25,000 -£50,000, with the balance met by the state. The plan would be expected to cost £7-10bn a year, or more if the ""floor"" – the level of household savings at which the state steps in to meet an individual's care costs – was raised from the current level of £23,000. The Treasury has traditionally opposed hypothecated taxes, where revenue is allocated for a particular purpose, but it is understood that Sunak would not object to an increase in an existing tax being branded as a levy to pay for social care. A one percentage point increase in the basic and higher rates of income tax would raise £5.7bn in the next financial year, and just over £7bn by 2024-25. Javid has insisted he is not ideologically opposed to the idea of a tax increase to tackle the social care crisis. ""In all my time in politics I haven't let ideology blind me to doing the practical and the obvious. I think that's as far as I'd go,"" he told the Telegraph. When the prime minister was asked about proposals for higher salt and sugar taxes this week, after a government-commissioned review, he said: ""I am not, I must say, attracted to the idea of extra taxes on hard-working people."" But he is also believed to be keen to deliver on the promise he made on the steps of Downing Street two years ago next week. Asked about the issue on Thursday, he said proposals would be published ""before too long"". The 2019 Conservative manifesto promised to build a cross-party consensus on social care reform. Speaking in January last year, Johnson said: ""Now we have the majority we need, we are going to get on with this so people can get the care they need in their old age but don't have to sell their home."" He added: ""We have got to think very carefully about how we do it because there are lots of quite important moral and social issues contained in it."" While there is cross-party agreement that the existing system of funding and delivering social care is unsustainable, governments of all stripes have failed to get to grips with the issue for fear of creating financial losers. Theresa May set out radical plans for reforming the system in the 2017 manifesto but they were quickly branded a ""dementia tax"" and her advisers were forced to adapt them on the hoof while she continued to insist ""nothing has changed"". When Andy Burnham was Labour health secretary he sought cross-party support for reforms that would have the costs of care partly met through a ""fair care contribution"", potentially levied on patients' estates after they had died. But the talks fell apart, and the attempt at a consensus approach resulted in the Tories accusing Labour of planning a ""death tax"". This article was amended on 23 July 2021 to clarify in the headline and text that the plans refer to England, not to the UK as a previous headline said.",Real Guardian,762.0
644,Real,The Guardian,"The government spent £73,000 on wine in 2019-20, almost three-quarters of it on English or Welsh wine – jokingly known as ""Brexit juice"" at Westminster – official figures show. Data published on Thursday reveal the changes in the vast government wine collection – used for official hospitality and functions – between 2018 and 2020.  In total, £73,000 was spent topping up the cellar in 2019-20, up from £46,906 in 2018-19. The average price was £17.25 a bottle, and 73% of the wine bought was English or Welsh. Purchases included 1,440 bottles of Chapel Down Bacchus, a dry white wine from the Kent vineyard. The replenishment of the collection is part-funded by selling off high-value bottles of wine. In 2018-19, the government raised a total of £44,000, with the sell-off including 24 bottles of Château Margaux 1988, and six magnums of 1982 Krug champagne. Another selection of bottles had been earmarked for sale in March 2020 that was expected to raise up to £50,000, but like so many other things it had to be abandoned because of the pandemic. In total, 4,045 bottles of wine and spirits were drank on government business in 2018-19, and 3,336 in 2019-20. There has been a shift towards British wine in recent years but it has accelerated under proud Brexiter Boris Johnson, who served it onboard the prime ministerial jet when he flew to the Biarritz G7 summit shortly after becoming leader. However, when the UK formally left the EU in February 2020, he celebrated at No 10 not with Brexit juice, as Leave campaigners had dubbed it, but with a £350 bottle of French red, reportedly donated in a Conservative donor's will. In total, 613 bottles of English sparkling wine were served at government receptions and events in the year to March 2020, and 163 bottles of white wine. France remained the producer of choice for red wine, however, with 257 bottles of claret consumed. The government wine cellar is housed in the basement of Lancaster House, the grand Foreign Office building on the edge of Green Park. In March 2020 – the most recent date for which information is available – the cellar contained 32,921 bottles. Their estimated value was £810,896.

645,Real,The Guardian,"Legislation to reorganise the NHS will ""institutionalise cronyism"", and could lead to funding cuts of more than £200 a patient in the most deprived areas of England, Labour has claimed. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, will bring the controversial health and care bill back to the House of Commons on Wednesday for its second reading, which Labour will oppose.  The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, told the Guardian it was ""the wrong bill at the wrong time"". ""The Conservatives are embarking on a top-down reorganisation when we are still in a pandemic, when admissions are rising, and we are going steeply up the trajectory to 100,000 infections a day; when you've got hospitals in Birmingham and Leeds saying they've got to cancel cancer surgery because of the pressures they are under; when the waiting list has topped 5.3 million, so big you can see it from outer space,"" Ashworth said. Under the complex reforms, more than 200 clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) will be replaced by just 42 much larger integrated care systems. The government has not yet given details of how funding will be allocated to these new commissioning units but Labour analysis suggests that if existing budgets are spread evenly across the new regions, deprived areas could suffer significant cuts. Blackpool could lose out by £287 a patient by being integrated into the much wider Lancashire and South Cumbria region, for example; Knowsley by £253 a patient as it joins Cheshire and Merseyside; and Salford by £116 a patient as it is swallowed up into the Greater Manchester health and care partnership. Several Conservative MPs, including former prime minister Theresa May and liaison committee chair Bernard Jenkin, have already raised questions about the impact of the reorganisation on their local areas. ""There are deep concerns about what this bill means for patient care,"" Ashworth said. ""I do not believe it will improve patient care. I don't believe it will integrate care: quite the opposite."" Ashworth also warned that the legislation as drafted does not reserve an automatic place on the new ICS boards for patient representatives, or for mental health providers – though they can be invited to join. ""Once again, we have another reorganisation – and we've had 20 in the last 30 years – where patients are sort of left as like a ghost in the machine: they're not thought about, and their interests are not brought to the fore at all,"" he said. And Labour claims the new powers the health secretary will take on as part of the shake-up could allow him to award lucrative outsourcing contracts to private companies. ""You don't want the secretary of state given the power whereby they can hand out contracts to the private sector with no accountability, no transparency whatsover,"" Ashworth said. ""We are concerned that there are elements of this bill that are a privatisers' charter, and we'll be seeking to get those elements taken out of the bill."" There is nothing in the legislation to prevent private healthcare providers sitting on an ICS, he claimed. That is already happening in Bath and North East Somerset, where Virgin Care, which delivers some local services, has a seat on the shadow ICS established to prepare for the shake-up. The legislation would also scrap section 75 of the Health and Social Care Act 2012, which made it mandatory for all NHS contracts to be put out to competitive tender. Citing multiple claims of cronyism during the pandemic, including former health secretary Matt Hancock's local pub landlord receiving a contract to manufacture PPE, Ashworth said: ""What this bill is about to do is to institutionalise that cronyism."" The shake-up was the brainchild of Hancock, who said it built on the lessons learned during the pandemic. When Javid introduced the legislation to parliament last week, he said it would make the NHS ""less bureaucratic, more accountable, and more integrated in the wake of Covid-19"". He added that it would allow ""closer collaboration between the NHS, local authorities and care providers to provide more joined-up working"". Some reports have suggested Javid was sceptical about the need for pressing ahead with the legislation, but the prime minister had insisted on it. Ashworth also reiterated his criticism of the government's decision to lift almost all Covid restrictions on 19 July, calling for mask-wearing to remain mandatory, and improved ventilation to be installed in public buildings.",Real Guardian,731.0
646,Real,The Guardian,"At first sight, Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson comprehensively bested the Conservative rebels on overseas aid on Tuesday, but the longer-term politics of the showdown may not be quite as straightforward. By explicitly linking the planned aid cut to the threat of tax increases, while claiming they still hoped to honour the 0.7% target at some unspecified future date, Sunak and Johnson won over enough waverers to deliver a majority of 35.  The chancellor's hand may have been strengthened in future tugs-of-war with Johnson about public spending too, and while a vocal band of Tory backbenchers care about the fate of the world's poorest, it seemed there were enough who cared more about avoiding tax rises or spending cuts. The same may apply to other issues close to the hearts of rebel bands of MPs, and Sunak can be expected to reach for a similar argument with those, too. Meanwhile, with polling suggesting a majority of voters support aid cuts in the wake of the pandemic, Johnson and his Downing Street team may also believe they have scored another victory in the culture war against wishy-washy liberals. While the rebellion was unsuccessful, the campaign to secure a vote on the issue and win over allies has cemented the emergence of a new, organised and vocal band of One Nation Conservatives. Pushed to the sidelines of Johnson's political project, they have become increasingly strident, and on this issue at least they had the support of Conservative grandees from outside the Commons, including the former prime ministers John Major and David Cameron and the former Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson, who called the aid cut ""a bloody disgrace"". Their concern is partly about values, including internationalism, but also the reputation of their party, which they fear is being cumulatively trashed by Johnson's government. Some backbench Conservatives are beginning to fret that they are becoming once again what May herself – long before she was in No 10 – once called the ""nasty party"". They worry that Johnson's happy-go-lucky approach to cronyism, bullying allegations, freebie holidays and ripping up manifesto pledges may eventually rebound on them, particularly in small-c conservative heartland seats. Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats – a party that knows a bit about the consequences of breaking election pledges – said the Conservatives' U-turn on aid, which was a clear manifesto promise, would cause voters to ditch the Conservatives ""in droves"". The former Tory MP David Gauke – one of those chucked out by Johnson during the Brexit rout of 2019 – said in the aftermath of the Chesham and Amersham byelection that there might be up to 40 Conservative-held seats where Tory voters do not much like what they see. In these commuter-belt seats, he argued, ""the Conservative vote is not Johnsonian, considers the government to be pretty populist, not focused on the interests of taxpayers, not sufficiently pro-business, and that vote is soft. And it's vulnerable."" Some Conservative MPs in areas like these report that ditching the aid pledge is beginning to come up in conversations with constituents, together with other questions about probity. Downing Street may be calculating that there are fewer of these seats – and of these voters – than Johnson could gain as the Brexit realignment spurs his continued advance into what was once solidly Labour territory. But ditching the aid pledge – much like Johnson's early equivocation over the England team taking the knee – may turn out not to have been quite such clever politics as it may at first have appeared.",Real Guardian,593.0
647,Real,The Guardian,"It was the comedian Matt Lucas who best captured the jarring ambiguity in Boris Johnson's broadcast to the nation last May, as restrictions began to be lifted after the first lockdown. In a much-watched video, Lucas parodied it as: ""Don't go to work; go to work; don't take public transport; go to work; don't go to work; stay indoors …"" Dominic Cummings, Johnson's embittered former adviser, has since put it even more cruelly, comparing the prime minister's approach to managing the pandemic to ""a shopping trolley smashing from one side of the aisle to the other"".  After a week in which ministers have lurched from promising freedom to urging caution, even some senior Conservatives privately acknowledge that the messages emanating from the government in recent days have been almost as baffling. Last Monday the new health secretary, Sajid Javid, told MPs boldly that ""freedom is in our sights once again"". His statement setting out the government's plan to lift almost all formal Covid restrictions was so well received by Tory backbenchers that one was heard to cry ""hallelujah"". Johnson did warn the public at last week's Downing Street briefing that it was not time to be ""demob happy"" and stressed that he would keep wearing his mask in certain circumstances out of politeness. But the overall tone was of blessed release. He proudly suggested the new approach was a shift from ""government diktat"" to relying on ""personal responsibility"". As the week went on, however, some of the practical risks with that approach became more evident. Javid conceded that pressing ahead with unlocking could mean 100,000 a cases a day, which adds up to millions of people self-isolating, at least until the rules are changed on 16 August. Ministers responded by announcing they would tweak the NHS Covid app to reduce its sensitivity – a move the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, compared to taking ""the batteries out of the smoke alarm"". With distress signals already beginning to go up from various parts of the NHS, there were also growing jitters about what would happen if the public read the scrapping of rules on masks and social gatherings not as a welcome return to personal responsibility but the green light for a summer free-for-all. Meanwhile, the glee of Conservative backbenchers who have long railed against restrictions appeared not to be shared by the wider public, if polling is anything to go by. And so it was that by Monday's press conference, Johnson was stressing ""this pandemic is not over"" and underlining the need for ""extreme caution"". Little has changed in concrete terms since last week's announcement – masks will still not be mandatory from 19 July, nightclubs can still reopen and mass events can go ahead – but the mood music is very different, and the risks more openly acknowledged. And Javid appears to have shifted within just a fortnight or so from boldly asserting after he replaced Matt Hancock that ""it's going to be irreversible. There's no going back"", to refusing to rule out reimposing restrictions if things get tough in the winter – perhaps in the face of alarming projections from Sage. The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, stressed at Monday's press conference the importance of ""going very slowly through this step"". Last spring, ministers were consistently surprised by how well the public complied with the detailed and draconian rules governing their everyday lives. Much now will depend on how they now shoulder the responsibility of judging the risks for themselves. And that may depend in turn on which of the government's mixed messages they have heard loudest.",Real Guardian,599.0
648,Real,The Guardian,"Keir Starmer has said the situation in Northern Ireland is ""fragile"" as the standoff with Brussels over the implementation of Boris Johnson's Brexit deal continues. The Labour leader has met community groups and politicians from all the main parties during a three-day visit to Northern Ireland, where he previously worked for six years.  ""I've been struck by the fragility of the situation here, and that's the word that everybody is using – that things are fragile,"" he told the Guardian. He said lack of trust had repeatedly come up in his conversations, in particular in relation to the Northern Ireland protocol. The protocol was negotiated by Johnson in an attempt to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, and involved the UK accepting some checks on goods between mainland Great Britain and Northern Ireland. But the implementation of the agreement has been fraught with difficulty, with the EU accusing the UK of failing to meet its obligations. ""There's a very strong feeling here that the prime minister knew what he was negotiating with the protocol. He then mis-sold it, wasn't straight about what the implications were, and he's now dumping responsibility for making it work,"" Starmer said. ""There's a strong sense that he's taking people here for fools, and they're not fools in Northern Ireland. He may think he's fooling his backbenchers, pleasing some people within his party, but in Northern Ireland nobody's taken in by this and there's a real lack of trust."" The EU recently agreed to extend by three months the grace period before mandatory checks are due to be introduced on products including British sausages to be sold in Northern Ireland. But the two sides remain deadlocked over the practicalities, with the UK accusing Brussels of taking an ""excessively purist interpretation"" of the agreement. Johnson's Europe minister, David Frost, has said he will announce in the coming days how the UK proposes to resolve the impasse. Starmer said Johnson should take on the job of resolving the situation himself. ""The prime minister should take personal responsibility. And that's what previous prime ministers have done in the honest broker role: somebody who understands and respects both communities, and is able, because they're trusted to bring people together over difficult issues. That is what is missing with this prime minister."" He said Lord Frost appeared to be ""keener to pick fights than to find solutions. And over here in Northern Ireland, that is not the way forward"". Starmer suggested a veterinary agreement between the two sides would be a good starting point for resolving the issue. As well as the protocol, Starmer said he had heard concerns about the government's proposal to impose an across-the-board statute of limitations on prosecutions relating to the Troubles. Conservative backbenchers including the former defence minister Johnny Mercer have been pressing for an amnesty for forces veterans who served in Northern Ireland, but Starmer said a statute of limitations was not the right approach. ""A blanket amnesty is simply wrong in principle: but more importantly, here's the difference I think between the way Boris Johnson approaches this and the way I would approach this: any discussion about legacy should always start with those most directly affected. By that I mean the victims who've lost loved ones or who were injured themselves,"" Starmer said. ""We were talking to them yesterday, and they've described the pain they still feel, and the fact that affects their children, their siblings."" In Derry on Friday Starmer met Sara Canning, the partner of the murdered journalist Lyra McKee, who now campaigns to bring different communities in Northern Ireland together. ""It was pretty amazing to walk over Peace Bridge with her this morning,"" he said.",Real Guardian,618.0
649,Real,The Guardian,"Reducing the sensitivity of the NHS Covid app to cut the number of people self-isolating is like ""taking the batteries out of the smoke alarm"", Keir Starmer has said as he raised questions about the decision to press ahead with reopening on 19 July. Speaking as he completed a three-day visit to Northern Ireland, the Labour leader said he had been alarmed by reports that ministers had decided to ""tune"" the app.  ""It's like taking the batteries out of the smoke alarm: it is so obviously to weaken the defences that we have – and if the consequence of the prime minister's decision is that people are deleting the NHS app, or the app is being weakened, then that's a pretty good indicator that the decision of the prime minister is wrong,"" he said. The decision to tune the app to cut its sensitivity was made amid reports that people were removing it from their phones because of fears about being repeatedly asked to self-isolate. Dr Jenny Harries, the head of the UK Health Security Agency, told MPs on Thursday: ""We have a piece of work ongoing at the moment because it is entirely possible to tune the app to ensure that it is appropriate to the risk. ""When the app came into action, we know it has been hugely successful, but it has been utilised in a world where we did not have vaccinations. So working through what a vaccinated population using the app means is something that we are actively doing at the moment."" Ministers are expected to make a final decision on Monday about whether to go ahead with lifting almost all restrictions on daily life on ""freedom day"", 19 July. They will do so on the basis of new modelling from experts on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) about the likely impact on hospitalisations and deaths of allowing infections to rise sharply. Starmer said he did not want to pre-empt the data, which is expected to be published on Monday, but he underlined his concerns about the risks of the government's no-holds-barred plan. ""The prime minister's approach, as he indicated earlier this week, it's lifting protections in one go at the same time, notwithstanding that infection rates are rising at a pretty alarming rate, that is going to lead to a summer of chaos,"" he said. Labour has suggested rules on mask-wearing should be maintained, and repeated calls for better financial support for people forced to self-isolate. It would also like tougher guidance on ventilation in workplaces and public venues, to reflect the most up-to-date understanding of how the virus is spread. Government sources are bullish about the likelihood of the 19 July reopening going ahead, despite a string of recent stories about pressures on the NHS and the test-and-trace system from rapidly increasing case rates.",Real Guardian,473.0
650,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson is poised to call an extra bank holiday if England win Sunday's football final at Wembley, as the government is being urged to publish safety data about previous Euro 2020 matches. Asked whether he could declare Monday a bank holiday in the event of an England win, the prime minister said: ""I think that would be tempting fate; let's see what happens.""  His official spokesperson later added: ""I don't want to pre-empt the outcome of Sunday's match. Clearly we want England to go all the way and win the final, and then we will set out our plans in due course."" Downing Street sources suggested the timing of the match meant it would be much too late to give fans an emergency day off next Monday – but other options were being considered. Asked whether bosses should allow their staff the day off to celebrate after watching the crucial tie, Johnson's spokesperson said: ""We would want businesses who feel able to consider it if they can, but we recognise it will vary depending on the business and company."" The prime minister, not previously known as a football fan, attended Wednesday's semi-final with his wife, wearing an England shirt apparently over his office attire, and with a suit jacket on top. The government has extended pub licensing hours to 11.15pm on Sunday to allow the public to watch the match, and celebrate or drown their sorrows afterwards. Meanwhile, questions have continued to be raised about the safety of allowing so many fans to watch the match in person during a pandemic. The England-Italy tie will be held in front of a 60,000-strong crowd – the same as Wednesday's semi-final. Seven earlier matches in the tournament were held as part of the government's events research programme, set up to test the safety of mass gatherings. The shadow sports minister, Alison McGovern, said data about the safety of these matches should be produced before Sunday. ""If they have the data they should publish it, and if they don't have it, they should say why,"" she said. Public Health Scotland has already published data about the Scottish fans who attended the England-Scotland match on 18 June, held with a much smaller crowd of 22,500. In total 1,991 people who later tested positive had attended one or more Euro 2020 events during their infection period, a time when they ""may have unknowingly transmitted their infection to others"". Only 397 of those were actually at Wembley for the match – but that represented 15% of the 2,600 Scotland fans who were allocated tickets. No data about how many English fans subsequently tested positive – or about later matches – is expected to be published until the end of the second phase of the programme, which is due to continue until late July. McGovern questioned whether the pilot scheme was really providing the information that events organisers and members of the public needed. ""The events research programme has been much more ad hoc than we would have liked,"" she said. ""It is unclear how the events have been chosen, and the process by which data has been made public is concerning."" Results from the first phase of the research programme, which included an FA Cup semi-final, were eventually published last month after pressure from the scientists overseeing it and in the face of threatened legal action from artists including Andrew Lloyd Webber. The findings were broadly positive – but the first phase took place at a time when daily Covid infections were much lower, and the report warned that ""events with high crowd density and proximity could potentially pose a greater transmission risk"". The ban on mass events is expected to be lifted completely on 19 July in England, as ministers believe vaccinations will by then have successfully severed the link between infection with the virus, hospitalisation and death. But some scientists have warned that pressing ahead with Euro 2020 matches is risky.",Real Guardian,658.0
651,Real,The Guardian,"The TUC's general secretary, Frances O'Grady, has accused ministers of ""washing their hands"" of employees' safety, after unions and business groups were told they would not be consulted on guidance set to come into force on 19 July in England. O'Grady, who represents 5.5 million workers, has written to the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, to express the TUC's concerns.  ""We have real fears that clear, detailed guidance for employers will be replaced by vague exhortations to do the right thing, resulting in confusion,"" she said. ""We believe this amounts to the government washing its hands of its responsibility to ensure workplace safety."" As businesses prepared to reopen after last year's lockdown, the then business secretary, Alok Sharma, carried out detailed discussions with representatives of employers and unions, about how best to make workplaces Covid-secure. Hundreds of pages of sector-specific guidance were then published, including everything from mask wearing to safety screens, hand sanitiser to staff rotas. With less than a fortnight to go before 19 July, the Guardian understands business groups and unions have been told by officials at Kwarteng's department that they will not be consulted on what will replace the present Covid-secure rules. Some believe the government now hopes to shift responsibility back on to individual employers as much as possible, in line with the wider ethos of ""freedom day"". Boris Johnson has described 19 July as an inflexion point, when the ""diktat"" of government regulations will be replaced by personal responsibility. The government has already made clear that the 1m distancing rule will be scrapped, mask wearing will no longer be mandatory in public places, and the guidance that office workers should work from home where possible will no longer apply. But it is unclear how much of the wider Covid-secure guidance will be withdrawn, and what the government plans to replace it with. Downing Street has suggested, for example, that it hopes a culture of wearing masks in some situations out of politeness will replace legal penalties. O'Grady warned: ""We all want working life to get back to business as usual. But as restrictions are lifted and increasing numbers return to their workplaces, it is crucial that we get workplace safety right, and give workers and members of the public confidence. ""This is how we get the country up and running again – not hobbled by rising infections and enforced self-isolation taking workers out of workplaces,"" she added. She pointed out that many workers still only have the protection of one dose of the vaccine, including many pregnant women, and some workers will have compromised immune systems. The Unite assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail said: ""Our members have been on the frontline for the last 16 months literally risking their lives and the health of their families, while keeping the UK operating. ""To not even consult their representatives in order to better understand workers' worries and concerns is not only arrogant but further undermines the public's confidence in the government's strategy."" Workplace guidance is just one aspect of how the world will look after 19 July that remains unclear: business groups are also pressing the government to commit to continuing to fund regular workplace testing for Covid. The CBI's director of policy, John Foster, welcomed hints from the chancellor on Thursday that the government will look again at the operation of the test and trace app, to try to reduce unnecessary self-isolation – something businesses have been calling for. But he added: ""There are other areas where clarity from government can help to boost confidence, for example, knowing whether workplace testing will continue beyond July. ""Responsible employers can play their part too, by having good, collaborative conversations with their employees and informing customers how they are reopening safely."" Health campaigners have also urged the government to publish new guidance for clinically vulnerable people about how they should protect themselves as cases surge in the coming weeks. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""As set out in the latest guidance in our roadmap out of lockdown, our policy for Step 4 has been carefully developed in line with the findings of the roadmap reviews into social distancing, certification and the events research programme. ""These reviews have been conducted in consultation with representatives from a variety of sectors. ""Working safely guidance will be updated to reflect the policy announced on Monday 5 July, to ensure businesses are able to open safely, reducing the risk of transmission and protecting staff and customers.""",Real Guardian,750.0
652,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson has been formally exonerated for his freebie holiday on the island of Mustique at the expense of a Tory donor. But the convoluted case is just the latest evidence of the prime minister's apparently cavalier attitude to money and where – or whom – it comes from. He appears to give little thought to how his lifestyle will be funded – ""friends"" have told journalists of his financial struggles – after a costly divorce from his second wife, Marina Wheeler, and without the £250,000 a year he once earned from writing Daily Telegraph columns.  The prime minister thought the matter of accepting £15,000-worth of accommodation from the Carphone Warehouse co-founder David Ross almost too trivial to mention, insisting he had only declared it voluntarily. It fits a pattern of behaviour that saw a Conservative peer, Lord Brownlow, initially meeting the costs of the lavish refurbishment of the Downing Street flat by the designer Lulu Lytle, before questions were raised about the arrangement and Johnson declared that he was meeting the costs himself. Johnson's new independent adviser on ministers' interests, Christopher Geidt, called the prime minister's approach to that project ""unwise"". The prime minister's former chief adviser Dominic Cummings claimed the initial plan for paying for the refurbishment had been ""possibly illegal"". Even in the last parliament, the committee for standards said Johnson had ""an over-casual attitude to obeying the rules"" – uncannily echoing the sentiment of his Eton housemaster, who wrote to the prime minister's father in 1982: ""I think he honestly believes that it is churlish of us not to regard him as an exception, one who should be free of the network of obligation which binds everyone else."" Almost 40 years later Johnson still appears, at best, unconcerned about following the rules – or, now that he is a public figure, about the importance of appearing to act with propriety. His former close friend Jennifer Arcuri – who claims to have had a romantic relationship with him – received taxpayer-backed support for her tech business and accompanied the then mayor of London on a trade mission. Johnson has insisted there was ""no interest to declare"". He awarded a peerage to the Conservative donor Peter Cruddas despite the House of Lords watchdog having suggested Cruddas – who had previously been implicated in a cash-for-access scandal, something he has consistently denied – should not be eligible. Cruddas gave the Tory party £500,000 several days after receiving the peerage. Johnson declined to sack Matt Hancock last month despite the health secretary having apparently failed to declare a personal relationship with a non-executive director at his own department – not to mention being snapped busting lockdown rules. It followed the prime minister's defence of Priti Patel in the face of a finding from his previous ethics adviser, Sir Alex Allan, that her conduct ""amounted to behaviour that can be described as bullying"". Allan subsequently resigned. Johnson also defended Robert Jenrick after he was accused of skewing a planning decision in favour of a Tory donor; and Gavin Williamson, who was sacked by Theresa May for leaking security secrets – something he staunchly denies – but restored to a place in the cabinet after helping Johnson to whip MPs into line during his 2019 leadership race. Johnson's supporters insist there has been no wrongdoing, pointing to the various official reports, including on the Mustique break, that have formally cleared him of rule-breaking. They put the financial chaos down to mere scattiness, and the defence of his cabinet colleagues to loyalty. Received wisdom at Westminster says Johnson's ambiguous relationship with the rules the little people follow is priced-in politically. Certainly, his colourful private life was no secret when he swept to a landslide majority in 2019. But opposition parties are beginning to see a glimmer of hope that the sheer accretion of stories such as these will eventually help them to topple the caricature of the prime minister as a harmlessly lovable rogue.",Real Guardian,662.0
653,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson has been cleared by parliament's committee on standards of wrongly declaring a luxury villa stay in Mustique funded by a Tory donor – but criticised for failing to ascertain the details himself at the time. The committee, chaired by the Labour MP Chris Bryant, opted not to endorse the findings of the independent commissioner for standards, Kathryn Stone, after Johnson revealed new details about the convoluted arrangement.  Johnson initially declared David Ross, a Tory donor, as the donor of the holiday accommodation in December 2019 in the register of members' interests. A spokesperson for Ross had previously accepted that he facilitated the trip, but insisted the entrepreneur did not ""pay any moneys whatsoever"". Stone, whose report is published alongside the committee's findings, suggested Johnson had ""sought and was offered"" the use of a villa owned by Ross, the co-founder of Carphone Warehouse, ""a friend of Mr Johnson and a political supporter of the Conservative party"". ""By Mr Johnson's and Mr Ross's own admission, the arrangements for funding Mr Johnson's holiday accommodation were ad hoc and informal, and do not appear to have been fully explained to Mr Johnson at the outset,"" she found. In the event, Johnson did not stay in Ross's villa, however, and Stone said she was ""unable to conclude what Mr Johnson's register entry should have contained"". She found him in breach of clause 14 of the House of Commons code of conduct for members, because he ""did not make sufficient inquiries to establish the full facts about the funding arrangements for his free accommodation, either before his holiday, as he should have done, or in 2020"". After Bryant's committee received Stone's report, it wrote to Johnson and Ross demanding more information. Their replies revealed fresh details of an ""ad hoc arrangement"", under which the Mustique Company, the island's management company, paid the owners of the villa in which Johnson and his partner stayed, and Ross subsequently reimbursed them. ""Taking the additional new evidence into account, the committee concluded that Mr Ross was the donor of Mr Johnson's holiday accommodation,"" the report said, meaning Johnson's initial declaration had been accurate. However, they rejected the prime minister's insistence that he had voluntarily registered the arrangement, saying it represented a substantial benefit in kind, and he was obliged to reveal it. They also found that it was ""regrettable"" that ""a full account and explanation of the funding arrangements"" had only come to light as a result of their own inquiries. While Johnson has been formally exonerated, the committee's findings underline the sense that Johnson's financial arrangements are haphazard. He had previously been forced to insist he was personally paying for a costly refurbishment of the Downing Street flat, after initially seeking to solicit funding from Tory donors for the project. The prime minister's ethics adviser, Lord Geidt, found he had acted ""unwisely"" over the funding of the flat project, though not that he had breached the ministerial code. Given that Johnson had previously been reprimanded twice in four months in the last parliament by the committee for standards for an ""over-casual attitude towards obeying the rules of the house"", the committee said it would have ""expected him to go the extra mile to ensure there was no uncertainty about the arrangements"". Johnson's ex-adviser Dominic Cummings has claimed the prime minister told him he wanted to quit politics shortly after the next general election, to ""make money and have fun"". Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said, ""this whole murky affair shows Boris Johnson has a casual relationship with the truth and a flagrant disregard for the most basic standards of integrity and trustworthiness that we would expect from a prime minister. ""The way Johnson handles his personal finances mirrors the way he governs the country – chaos and confusion."" ",Real Guardian,633.0
654,Real,The Guardian,"""Freedom is in our sights once again!"" Sajid Javid told Conservative MPs on Tuesday, as he announced that double-jabbed people will not be required to quarantine from 16 August if they come in contact with a Covid sufferer. That mid-August date was the one concession to caution in a package of measures for ""freedom day"" that was more liberal than many at Westminster had expected, and has led Labour to accuse the government of being reckless.  Ministers willingly acknowledge that the approach they are taking, of lifting all restrictions at once, is a gamble, which might cause cases to surge – but they maintain that now is the moment to act. ""Whenever you unlock, there's a third wave, right?"" said one senior Conservative. Given what they regard as the political impossibility of leaving restrictions in place in the long term, the judgment became about which date was the least risky. The 21 June moment initially set for step four of the roadmap in February was rejected, to give the NHS a chance to push up vaccination rates. But by 19 July, the government expects two-thirds of adults to have received both doses. With most schools breaking up in the week of 19 July, that data also coincides with the ""firebreak"", when school-age children, who remain unvaccinated, are away from their classmates for six weeks. The government fears that if it pushes the reopening later, the resulting sharp increase in cases would start to crash into the usual autumn/winter increase in seasonal flu. Cooler weather and indoor socialising also make happy hunting grounds for the virus. ""We know Covid loves winter,"" as one government source put it. So ultimately the ""quad"" of senior ministers opted to press ahead with 19 July. Perhaps more controversially, they opted for a full-blooded version of ""freedom day"" that will ditch almost all restrictions. The outlines of the package announced on Monday were broadly agreed at a meeting of the quad – Javid, Johnson, Rishi Sunak and Michael Gove – on Thursday, according to government sources, with key details including how and when the schools policy would be announced ironed out on Sunday. The go-ahead was then given by the Covid-O cabinet subcommittee on Monday, before the wider cabinet was consulted. Modelling presented to ministers before the decisions suggested that although infections could reach an unprecedented 100,000 a day, hospitalisations were likely to peak at a level lower than during the January wave. However, though Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance ultimately agreed that reopening should go ahead, both have warned that contingency plans must be made for the autumn. Several senior Tories suggested the presence of the more libertarian Javid around the table, instead of Matt Hancock, was likely to have tipped the balance towards a bolder approach. Downing Street insists that his presence was not the deciding factor, pointing out that Boris Johnson has been insisting since before Hancock's humiliation that the 19 July date would be a ""terminus"". But one government source conceded that ""having the health secretary as cover definitely made a difference"". Another senior Conservative who knows the players well said it was evident that the decision had been reached without ""the counterbalance of Matt"". The prime minister's former adviser Dominic Cummings has repeatedly portrayed Johnson as anti-restrictions, and Conservative MPs have been increasingly vocal in calling for the public to be given the freedoms they were promised vaccination would bring. Javid's arrival appears to have cemented that view. The health secretary is such a fan of The Fountainhead, the libertarian fable by the American author and philosopher Ayn Rand, made into a 1949 film starring Gary Cooper, that he once confessed to reading the courtroom scene aloud to his future wife. In it, the character played by Cooper in the film, Howard Roark, forcefully defends the right of individuals to make their own decisions, rather than be subordinated to ""the collective"". Javid's aides insist he is motivated not by ideology, but a hard-nosed assessment of the costs of continuing restrictions, not just for the economy but for the NHS, which has built up a huge backlog of non-Covid work. And ministers appear to have taken the view, ""If not now, then when?"" But by ditching masks – which polls suggest the public would like to keep in some circumstances – throwing open nightclubs and giving the green light to standing six deep in crowded bars, some more cautious Tories believe the government is setting itself up for yet another embarrassing U-turn.",Real Guardian,751.0
655,Real,The Guardian,"Kim Leadbeater's surprise win in Batley and Spen has delighted Labour MPs and bought Keir Starmer precious political breathing space. But his new team know they may only have a few months to convince anxious backbenchers that he has what it takes to lead the party to a general election victory. Speculation was rife at Westminster this week about a potential leadership bid. Angela Rayner's aides dismissed as ""cobblers"" the idea that the deputy leader was preparing an imminent challenge. But the sense that Labour was going backwards electorally had left many MPs yearning for a change at the top and casting around for someone bold – or reckless – enough to act.  Without the fuel of another humiliating byelection defeat, all the fevered gossip about ""stalking horse"" challengers and ""kamikaze"" MPs will come to an end – for now at least. But for Starmer's team, fresh from their (narrow) triumph in Batley, there is a hard task ahead. As Andrew Scattergood, the co-chair of the leftwing Labour campaign group Momentum, put it: ""We've held on to Batley and Spen: good. Now we need to start talking about transformative policies that will change people's lives and not just relying on soundbites and patience in order to try and win people over."" Starmer's allies readily accept he has struggled to cut through the blizzard of Covid news over the past 12 months with a clear message about how Labour would improve voters' lives. The departure of a string of key aides from his inner circle, including the longtime communications chief Ben Nunn and the political director Jenny Chapman, has coincided with a new, more punchy approach. Starmer's team are now drawing up a summer schedule of meetings and visits in constituencies across the UK. ""Keir in natural mode,"" as one aide described it. They are emphatic it will not just be a listening exercise, after his former aide Simon Fletcher asked in a highly critical piece in the New Statesman this week: ""What if the issue is in fact that what people want to hear is that Labour stands for something with conviction?"" A party source said: ""It's very much not a listening tour. It's Keir taking his ideas and his beliefs and his values out to people."" There were several special factors at work in Batley and Spen, not least the presence of George Galloway. But the result, in which the Conservatives' vote share fell back from its 2019 level, has given Labour a chink of hope that Boris Johnson's party is not electorally impregnable. Labour has long awaited the return of something more like politics-as-usual after the pandemic-dominated national debate of the past few months. After the Batley result, Starmer's supporters on the backbenches are urging restive colleagues to give him more time to make his case to the public. The Exeter MP, Ben Bradshaw, said: ""In May's elections, the only national test of public opinion since the 2019 election, Keir cut the Tories' lead to 7%, less than half the deficit he inherited from the previous leadership, and despite the vaccine and end of lockdown bounce enjoyed by the government. ""As we come out of Covid and the normal rules of politics return, so will more opportunities for Keir to cut through. People need to keep calm, Keir needs to continue strengthening his team and deal firmly and resolutely with disloyalty, particularly if it is coming from the shadow cabinet."" Another loyalist said: ""The appointments he's made look to be good, and are going some way to restoring some confidence."" The experienced pollster Deborah Mattinson arrives in the role of head of party strategy on Monday, and the new political director, Luke Sullivan, a longtime party official, knows the parliamentary party well. The post of communications director, which is expected be advertised in the coming days, is being filled temporarily by the Blairite veteran Matthew Doyle. Meanwhile the new campaign coordinator, Shabana Mahmood, who replaced Rayner in the role after Starmer moved his deputy aside, has instituted a daily 8am call with shadow cabinet aides, aimed at sharpening up Labour's response to day-to-day news and giving the Tories a tougher ride. Labour under Starmer previously recoiled from calling for cabinet resignations, but they were quick to demand Matt Hancock be sacked after he was filmed kissing a colleague, and they have also called for the sacking of the health minister Lord Bethell over his use of a private email address for government business. As well as continuing to highlight cronyism and conflicts of interest, Labour plans to emphasise two policy areas where Starmer believes the party has a distinctive pitch to make: crime, and the world of work. On crime, Starmer has already used prime minister's questions to press Johnson about pitifully low rates of conviction for rape. He believes tackling crime resonates with former Labour voters and allows him to highlight his experience as director of public prosecutions. The party has also announced it would aim to scrap government plans for a £200m ""vanity yacht"" and spend the money saved on tackling antisocial behaviour. The second area Labour wants to talk more about is work – underlining the damage done by insecure, casual contracts, and the need for good-quality jobs.",Real Guardian,873.0
656,Real,The Guardian,"Labour MPs who have campaigned hard for Kim Leadbeater in Batley and Spen over recent days say her narrow 323 vote victory in Thursday's byelection is very much hers. A committed local activist who has worked to bring her local community together since her MP sister, Jo Cox, was murdered there by extremists in 2016, she dealt calmly and resolutely with the rigours of a nasty campaign.  Indeed, party strategists believe it was partly the public's revulsion at unsettling images of Leadbeater being heckled that helped bring voters out to support her, even from traditionally Conservative areas of the seat. Even on Thursday, Labour MPs contacted by the Guardian as they poured into Batley for a get-out-the vote drive in the sunshine remained pessimistic, so her narrow victory came as a sweet relief. Had Leadbeater lost, however, such is the brutal nature of Westminster politics that it would have been read by many backbench MPs not as her personal defeat, but Keir Starmer's. The Labour leader has come under consistent friendly fire in recent weeks for failing to offer a convincingly clear message about what the party stands for, or to narrow Boris Johnson's poll lead despite a string of revelations about sleaze. Many MPs have privately been offering gloomy prognostications in recent days about the dire state of their party, and some were preparing to urge colleagues to launch a leadership challenge. There were even suggestions Labour could come third, behind George Galloway – way wide of the mark in the event, since Leadbeater took 13,296 votes, her Conservative rival Ryan Stephenson 12,973 and Galloway 8,264. So febrile was the mood in recent days that even Starmer's deputy, Angela Rayner, was being mooted as a candidate, and was forced to deny any knowledge of plans for a leadership bid on Thursday – though she did not quite rule out launching one. Rayner was regarded by many on the left of the party as the only person likely to win over the 40 MPs necessary to launch a bid; but there were also ominous rumblings from more centrist MPs about how long Starmer could viably last had Labour lost Batley and Spen. All that chatter will now stop abruptly, at least for the time being. MPs and party members are likely to feel Starmer has earned himself the benefit of the doubt – though his new leadership team know he has a hard road ahead to Labour's autumn conference. Leadbeater's narrow victory, turning the seat into a super-marginal, suggests the electoral tide may still be moving against Labour – Tracy Brabin's majority in the 2019 general election was more than 3,500. The fact that Galloway was able to convince 8,000 voters to support him by playing on Starmer's alleged neglect of the Muslim community is also likely to stoke fears that Labour is alienating once-loyal groups of voters. But Starmer now has a clear run to get on with what he has been promising his party he is ready to do: get out to the voters and convince them Labour would improve their lives, and he would make a better prime minister than Johnson. And, meanwhile, Labour MPs who still feel keenly the loss of their friend Jo Cox will be able to welcome her sister into Cox's old seat on the green benches of the House of Commons.",Real Guardian,560.0
657,Real,The Guardian,"Keir Starmer's team insisted they were ""relaxed"" about the potential for a backlash after the Batley and Spen byelection on Thursday night, as counting got under way. Scores of MPs descended on the Yorkshire constituency on a sunny day to canvass for Kim Leadbeater, the sister of murdered MP Jo Cox, as senior party figures reported a modest shift towards Labour in recent days.  Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner was among those knocking on doors, after being forced to deny any immediate plans to challenge Starmer for the leadership. Even before polling opened in Batley, some Labour MPs were feverishly discussing what might happen if the party were to lose the seat, with some even suggesting the leader should resign – but a Starmer aide said: ""He's not going anywhere."" The Labour leader is expected to come out fighting after the byelection, with a string of public appearances and policy announcements. ""We know we have work to do,"" said a party source. The Guardian understands that allies of Rayner did make tentative approaches to potential supporters after May's Hartlepool byelection, which Labour lost, and believed at the time they could have mustered the 40 MPs necessary to launch a challenge. But they insist she does not want to stand now, preferring to try to shape Labour policy, and they are concerned about the risk to her reputation if she wields the knife against a sitting leader. Responding to reports that she is preparing to overthrow Starmer, who has only been in post for just over a year, Labour's deputy leader tweeted it was ""news to me"". Senior sources at the Unite trade union also denied they had had any approach from potential leadership candidates, insisting the only race they were focused on was the one to succeed its chief, Len McCluskey. An aide to Rayner said: ""Angela is focused entirely on her jobs. She has set out radical economic policy on the future of work and has led the way hammering [former health secretary Matt] Hancock and the government over private emails, dodgy contracts and sleaze. ""She is also perfectly capable of speaking for herself and doesn't need anyone to claim to speak for her."" However, underlining the continuing bad blood between the deputy leader and Starmer, Rayner's supporters believe the stories are being promulgated by outriders of the Labour leader, hoping to undermine her by making her appear disloyal. MPs on the left of the party in particular have become increasingly despairing about Labour's direction and prospects of winning the next general election under Starmer. However, his backers in the parliamentary party are urging colleagues to keep calm and give him a chance to make his case to voters over the summer. The Batley and Spen byelection is an early test for Labour's new election coordinator, Shabana Mahmood, who only took on the role in May. The historic loss of Hartlepool in May was followed by a standoff in which Starmer removed Rayner from her posts as party chair and national elections coordinator, but she dug her heels in and emerged with several new job titles, including shadow secretary of state for the future of work.",Real Guardian,528.0
658,Real,The Guardian,"Senior Labour figures believe the party has only a 5% to 10% chance of holding the West Yorkshire seat of Batley and Spen in Thursday's byelection, as Keir Starmer's team brace themselves for a backbench revolt if the Tories take the seat. The constituency formerly held by the murdered MP Jo Cox is being contested for Labour by her sister, Kim Leadbeater, in a contest marred by allegations of dirty tricks and intimidation.  Leadbeater, who lives locally, has been chased and heckled on the campaign trail. The Jo Cox Foundation issued a statement on Tuesday expressing concern about the impact of intimidation on public figures. ""Addressing this intimidatory and abusive culture matters. It matters for the diversity of our public life, it matters for the way in which the public can engage with representative democracy, and it matters for the safety and emotional wellbeing of the people it affects. We can and must debate our differences passionately, but not at the price of legitimising violence,"" the foundation said. Labour has poured resources into Batley and Spen in recent weeks, with scores of MPs descending on the constituency to knock on doors after the race was triggered by sitting MP Tracy Brabin winning the West Yorkshire mayoralty. Former Labour MP and Russia Today presenter George Galloway is standing as an independent, under the banner of the Workers Party, claiming the race is a referendum on Starmer's leadership. Labour party strategists have played down the party's hopes of a win on Tuesday, increasingly fearing that Galloway will attract enough votes to allow the Conservatives to scrape home. One MP who has been canvassing in the area said: ""At the beginning, I would have said it was not like Hartlepool. Now, I've changed my mind – I think we're going to lose it."" Labour sources pointed out the Tories could have won the West Yorkshire seat in the December 2019 general election had it not been for the Brexit party and a candidate for the Heavy Woollen District Independents taking more than 8,000 votes between them. Nevertheless, another defeat after Hartlepool – and after the Liberal Democrats snatched Chesham and Amersham from the Conservatives despite the ""vaccine bounce"" – would be greeted with horror by Labour MPs in potentially vulnerable red wall seats. ""Everyone will be watching Batley and Spen,"" said one backbencher, who said a poor result for Labour could suggest ""there's potentially another 20-50 seats across the north that we are going to lose"". They warned that fear could prompt a ""kamikaze"" attempt on Starmer's leadership – though it is unclear whether any candidate could gather the 40 signatures necessary to trigger a contest. Several MPs said Angela Rayner was the only MP who could attract the necessary names – but her allies denied reports that she could launch a challenge, attributing them to, ""men in suits going around claiming to speak for Angela, when she's more than capable of speaking for herself."" Despairing backbenchers said they will be watching Starmer's response on Friday closely, with many grumbling that it remains unclear what Labour's distinctive message to the electorate is. But the shadow sports minister, Alison McGovern, who was a friend of Jo Cox and has worked with Leadbeater on the Jo Cox Foundation, rejected the idea a poor result would be a blow for Starmer personally. ""If we manage to pull off a miracle then it will be because of Kim: she's just a great person,"" she said, adding, ""whatever happens, of course we have got to argue for Keir to be the prime minister, and we have got to argue for Labour to be the government: that's on us. But that's not because of a byelection, it's due to having lost in 2019 and really needing to win."" Starmer has already shaken up his team since Labour lost last month's Hartlepool byelection, with key figures including political director Jenny Chapman departing. Lady Chapman is being replaced by Luke Sullivan, a longtime party official who knows Labour MPs well after a long stint at the side of former chief whip Nick Brown. More senior appointments are expected to be announced in the coming days. Former Starmer aide Simon Fletcher, a well-respected party veteran who also worked for Jeremy Corbyn and Ed Miliband, used a New Statesman article on Tuesday to urge the party to ""avoid creating the impression that it has fallen into a pit of self-loathing"". Starmer's team said he will host a series of town hall-style meetings across the country in the run-up to Labour's September conference. But Fletcher warned against another ""listening exercise"". ""What if the issue is in fact that what people want to hear is that Labour stands for something with conviction?"" he wrote. ""If Labour is not to be left permanently stranded in opposition, it must now be bolder and leave people in no doubt about its intentions.""",Real Guardian,815.0
659,Real,The Guardian,"Labour is calling on England's employers to allow staff to leave work early to watch the Euro 2020 clash with Germany.

Gareth Southgate's team face the German side at Wembley on Tuesday, as they bid to secure a place in the quarter-finals. Rayner, Labour's deputy leader, said: ""Today is an absolutely massive day for our country. After being apart from our friends and family for so long, many of us will want to watch the game with our loved ones, whether at home or in the pub. ""So we urge the prime minister to back Labour's call to let staff finish early so they can enjoy the game and get behind the England team."" Rayner added: ""Obviously this won't be possible for lots of key workers and shift workers – the very same people who have kept our country going through this pandemic. So we think we all owe them another big thank you today."" Starmer tweeted: ""Good luck to England ahead of today's game against Germany.

Rayner has been shadow secretary of state for the future of work since May, when Starmer moved her aside from her role as party chair after the Hartlepool byelection loss. Labour's general secretary, David Evans, has told its staff they can knock off in time to get home to watch the game, the party said. The schools minister, Nick Gibb, earlier told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""a matter for industry and for business"", whether workers were able to watch the match. He said he would be taking part in a debate in the Commons when the football started. Asked if his own staff at the Department for Education could finish early, he said: ""Civil servants have a very demanding job and I'm sure they'll be able the juggle the demands of being a civil servant with being able to sneak a glimpse.""",Real Guardian,355.0
660,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson has sought to claim the credit for removing the disgraced former health secretary Matt Hancock, despite Downing Street repeatedly saying on Friday he ""considered the matter closed"". Asked by reporters whether Hancock's relationship with the Department of Health board member Gina Coladangelo had undermined public health messaging, Johnson said: ""That's right, and that's why when I saw the story on Friday we had a new secretary of state for health in on Saturday.""  He was speaking on a visit to Batley and Spen, the West Yorkshire constituency where a byelection will be held on Thursday. Conservative MPs were baffled on Friday about why the prime minister had not already demanded Hancock's resignation, with many contacting their whips to warn that their constituents were angry about the issue. Some backbenchers had compared the wave of fury among voters to the outpouring that followed Dominic Cummings's lockdown-busting trip to Durham. Despite Johnson's remarks appearing to suggest he had removed Hancock, his official spokesperson conceded on Monday that had not been the case, and Hancock had voluntarily resigned. ""The health secretary offered his resignation, he discussed it with the prime minister and he agreed it was the right decision,"" the spokesperson said. Asked why it was not deemed the right decision on Friday, he said: ""They discussed the issue further on Saturday, and the prime minister accepted his resignation and agreed it was the right thing to do."" He added: ""You've seen the actions that the prime minister took."" Asked what those actions had been, he cited Johnson's appointment of Sajid Javid as health secretary. The prime minister met Hancock on Saturday at his country residence, Chequers. He had previously defended the health secretary, after images emerged of Hancock kissing Coladangelo, a longtime friend who had been brought into the department as a non-executive director. Hancock tried to ride out the storm of publicity on Friday morning, after pictures of him in a clinch with Coladangelo on 6 May, when people were still being advised not to hug, were splashed across the Sun newspaper. He issued an apology for breaking lockdown rules and asked for ""privacy"" to deal with a ""personal matter"" – but failed to address the issue of how and why Coladangelo had been hired as a non-executive director, a position in which she was meant to provide independent oversight of the department. Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said: ""Boris Johnson is trying to rewrite history because he didn't have the guts to sack Matt Hancock."" She added: ""A fish rots from the head down, and by failing to sack the former health secretary, Johnson proved he doesn't have the leadership qualities or judgement required to be prime minister."" Cummings waded into the row on Twitter on Monday, recalling his comparison of Johnson with an out-of-control shopping trolley. He suggested that the prime minister may have changed his position after being bombarded with embarrassing headlines and messages from his wife, Carrie. He said Johnson's response on Saturday had been ""SMASH: Arghhh Matt go now you'll be back better stronger shortly matey forward to victory!"" before then claiming credit for his departure on Monday. Briefing journalists on Friday lunchtime, more than 12 hours after the story broke, Johnson's spokesperson repeatedly sidestepped the question of why Hancock had not been dismissed. ""You've seen the health secretary's statement, so I would point you to that,"" he said. ""I don't really have anything further to add. The health secretary set out that he accepted he had breached the social distancing guidelines and he has apologised for that. ""The prime minister has accepted the health secretary's apology and considers the matter closed."" Hancock's resignation statement, published on Saturday evening, suggested he had made his own decision to leave his post. In his letter to the prime minister, Hancock said: ""I am writing to resign as secretary of state for health and social care. We have worked so hard as a country to fight the pandemic. The last thing I would want is for my private life to distract attention from the single-minded focus that is leading us out of this crisis.""",Real Guardian,688.0
661,Real,The Guardian,"Matt Hancock was always going to have to resign, after those already notorious pictures of him embracing a colleague on taxpayers' time emerged on Friday morning. The question now troubling senior Tories, is why didn't Boris Johnson sack him? Johnson had weathered several previous scandals by sending his spokesman out to say ""the prime minister considers the matter closed,"" including Priti Patel's alleged bullying and Robert Jenrick's relations with a Tory-supporting property developer.  Yet this time was always going to be different: not only had Hancock been pictured breaking the very rules he had been urging the public to obey, but he was the government's main communicator of public health messages. Next time he appeared at the podium in the £2.6m Downing Street briefing room, he would have been peppered with questions about his own breach of lockdown guidance – and about other murkier matters such as how and when Gina Coladangelo had been brought into his department. And worst of all for the government, the scandal combined two messages the opposition parties have been trying to make stick for months – that this government is sleazy and that its principals think the rules they are urging the public to follow do not apply to them. Hancock's position was clearly untenable on Friday morning – yet Johnson chose to try to protect him. Keir Starmer's response to Hancock's resignation – ""Matt Hancock is right to resign. But Boris Johnson should have sacked him"" – shows Labour now hopes to make the prime minister pay a political price for his failure to act more decisively. Even Johnson's defenders say the prime minister tends to skirt confrontation and struggles to deliver difficult messages. The former Vote Leave director Chris Montgomery wrote in the Critic magazine about Johnson struggling to dismiss a member of staff at the Spectator. ""Boris wanted to remove someone. Boris couldn't do this himself. His stratagems over the course of months' trying included wondering aloud to his would-be victim: 'You'll have a private income of course?' ('No Boris,' the victim flatly replied, 'I work because I need the money.') The victim found that their desk was moved to ever more remote corners of Doughty Street."" Eventually, Montgomery recalled, Johnson brought some of his children into the office on the day appointed for the bad news to be delivered, and then ""scarpered"", leaving a colleague to deliver the bad news in the pub. Dominic Cummings claimed that in cabinet meetings, ""as soon as things get 'a bit embarrassing' [Johnson] does the whole 'let's take it offline' shtick before shouting 'Forward to victory,' doing a thumbs-up and pegging it out of the room before anybody can disagree"". Others who have worked with Johnson corroborate the fact that he recoils from dismissing colleagues. Johnson's chief of staff, Dan Rosenfield, is widely thought in Westminster to have fallen out of favour. But one senior Tory said if that was so, the prime minister was highly unlikely to tackle the issue head-on. ""He won't sack Dan, he'll sideline him. He never sacked Eddie [Lister, Johnson's former chief of staff], he never sacked Gazza [Ben Gascoigne, his former political secretary], he just listened to them less."" Both men left of their own accord, as the power dynamic in Number 10 shifted in recent months. Johnson has barely touched the makeup of his cabinet, aside from last February's reshuffle, in which Sajid Javid was pushed out – something Cummings now claims he ""tricked"" Johnson into doing. Another former colleague of Johnson's claimed he still smarted from being sacked by Michael Howard from the opposition frontbench in 2004, over claims about his private life, which Johnson had dismissed as ""an inverted pyramid of piffle"". Perhaps in Hancock's case, Johnson also felt it was unwise to appear to be making a judgment about a colleague's personal conduct, given his own well-known record on marital infidelity. And perhaps, too, he hoped Hancock could continue to act as a lightning rod for criticism of the government's handling of the pandemic. Yet the danger for No 10 in this weekend's events is that Johnson's failure to sack Hancock revives the perception of the prime minister as someone who turns a blind eye to his mates' misdemeanours that built up in the wake of the Cummings scandal (back when he and his then chief adviser were still friends). It may also underline a sense that in contrast to his gung-ho public persona, the prime minister is indecisive, even a ""ditherer"" – a charge he likes to chuck at Starmer across the floor of the House of Commons. One former cabinet minister, who campaigned across a string of marginal constituencies in the 2019 general election, said even in the ""red wall"" seats the Tories triumphantly gained, voters ""don't much love Boris"" – but they loathed Jeremy Corbyn and wanted a government that would enact Brexit. Even before this weekend, defeat in Chesham and Amersham suggested some traditional Tory voters may already have come to the conclusion they disapprove of the way Johnson is running the country: campaigners said cronyism came up on the doorsteps.",Real Guardian,851.0
662,Real,The Guardian,"Matt Hancock was a strong contender for the adjective ""beleaguered"" even before grainy pictures of him snogging an old college friend he'd employed at taxpayers' expense were splashed all over the Sun on Friday morning. When the Queen was filmed making small talk with Boris Johnson as their weekly audiences resumed in person on Wednesday, she told the prime minister she had been speaking to ""your secretary of state for health, poor man"".  In recent days, Hancock had also had to brush off private messages from the prime minister published by Dominic Cummings in which he was derided as ""totally fucking hopeless"" and deny lying to colleagues so frequently and outrageously that the politically neutral cabinet secretary wanted him sacked. Defending himself against those allegations in the House of Commons last month, he said: ""I have been straight with people in public and private throughout. Every day I have got up and asked: 'What must I do to protect life?' That is the job of a health secretary in a pandemic."" Friday's leaked pictures suggest he also had time to think about other matters – yet, like Cummings when his Barnard Castle jaunt emerged, Hancock has opted to try to tough it out, apologising for breaching social distancing guidelines and asking for privacy to deal with ""this personal matter"". Colleagues confirmed that was very much in character. Politicians don't tend to be burdened with crushing self-doubt, but even among MPs, Hancock is renowned for his Teflon-coated self-regard. And even in a cabinet that includes Gavin Williamson, rehabilitated by Johnson after allegedly leaking state security secrets to the Telegraph, and Priti Patel, brought back after organising secret meetings in Israel, he stands out as an extraordinary survivor. Hancock's backstory is hardly an unusual one for a Conservative minister. His parents set up a small tech business, and he studied philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford, where he took a first-class degree, before going to Cambridge to do a master's in economics. It was at Oxford where he met his wife, Martha – and also Gina Coladangelo, the woman he has been snapped embracing in his Department of Health office. She told Radio 4's Profile that they were ""close friends of more than 20 years"" who had met when Hancock was reporting on sport for the student radio station Oxygen FM and she was reading the news. Coladangelo revealed that Hancock was sometimes economical with the truth – saying he once overslept when he was meant to be covering a big rugby match at Twickenham, and gave his report from a phone box outside a pub. After university, Hancock became an economist at the Bank of England before being taken on as an economic adviser by the young shadow chancellor George Osborne, eventually becoming his chief of staff. Together with another adviser, Rupert Harrison, who had been Hancock's contemporary at Oxford, the pair successfully built up the economic narrative that Labour had failed to ""fix the roof while the sun was shining"". As their promise of a ""long-term economic plan"" swept Gordon Brown out of Downing Street at the May 2010 general election, Hancock arrived in the House of Commons as the MP for West Suffolk, then aged just 31. He was made a junior business minister in the coalition government in 2013. Three years later, Hancock was on the remain side with his old boss during the Brexit referendum campaign. But unlike Osborne and Cameron, after the results came in, Hancock remained in Westminster, as the political shockwaves unleashed by the result continued to reverberate – and he has been on the frontbench ever since. He had a short-lived stint as culture secretary from January 2018 – memorably videoing himself trying out the sport of parkour. Just six months later, Theresa May made him health secretary, when Boris Johnson resigned as foreign secretary over her Brexit deal and Jeremy Hunt was given that role. When May had to accept defeat and step aside after failing to persuade MPs to back her Brexit deal for a third time, Hancock fancied himself as her potential successor – or at least saw political advantage in having a shot at the top job. He launched his campaign with the slogan Let's Move Forward, handing out themed phone chargers to journalists attending a slick launch event. His backers included David Lidington, May's serious and strongly pro-European de facto deputy, who has since left parliament. Hancock received 20 votes from MPs in the first round. He then dropped out and later threw his weight behind the increasingly unstoppable-looking Johnson campaign, despite having been a remainer. Hancock said at the time he had received assurances from Johnson that he would govern as a one-nation Conservative, and he praised the now prime minister lavishly in a series of media appearances. It worked: Johnson kept him on as health secretary despite chucking out many other senior remainers and other heavyweight figures from the May years. Nine months later, Hancock found himself at the eye of the storm as the Covid crisis hit.",Real Guardian,842.0
663,Real,The Guardian,"Keir Starmer is calling on Boris Johnson to scrap his plans for a ""vanity yacht"" and instead spend the money on tackling antisocial behaviour. Pledging to make Labour ""the party of law and order"", Starmer highlighted the blight of antisocial behaviour, such as off-road bikes and high-powered cars being raced through residential neighbourhoods.  ""As chief prosecutor, I saw far too many examples of crimes perceived as 'low-level' not being tackled quickly enough before they escalate,"" the Labour leader said. ""People can end up afraid in their own homes, or scared to go out at night."" In a sign that Starmer may be heeding the pleas of his MPs for him to attack Johnson more forcefully, he added: ""I not only understand deeply why tackling antisocial behaviour is needed, but I'm frustrated by the prime minister's priorities. His multimillion-pound vanity yacht isn't addressing people's everyday concerns. Labour will scrap it and fund crime fighting instead."" The prime minister's spokesperson recently announced plans for the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to buy a ""national flagship"", which could be used to host trade delegations. The decision followed a long-running campaign by Johnson's former newspaper the Daily Telegraph for taxpayers to fund a replacement for the Royal Yacht Britannia. While the MoD will be in charge of the procurement process, it is unclear which department will foot the bill. Johnson claimed the vessel would underline the UK's ""burgeoning status as a great, independent maritime trading nation"". The yacht is expected to cost up to £200m, and Labour estimates the running costs could be £83m over the course of a parliament – based on updating the cost of running the Britannia to 2021 prices. Starmer said that money could be used to create a £285m enforcement fund, allocated to antisocial behaviour hotspots, to provide surge policing, or fund additional CCTV or extra council enforcement officers. Labour would also legislate to crack down on antisocial driving – by requiring a ""black box"" to be fixed to high-powered rental cars to ensure they were tracked, for example. The party is keen to highlight its determination to crack down on crime, and underscore the impact of police and local authority cuts under successive Conservative governments. Labour strategists believe crime is one of the policy areas that can unite voters on both sides of its fragile electoral coalition – working-class voters in former industrial ""red wall"" seats and city-based graduates. Starmer's rejection of the national yacht plan may stir memories among Labour veterans of Tony Blair's 1997 stump speeches, when he repeatedly criticised the plans of the then defence secretary, Michael Portillo, for a royal yacht, saying Labour would not waste money on the plan. Then, as now, the Conservatives claimed the vessel would benefit UK trade. Tackling low-level neighbourhood crime was also a recurrent theme for Labour in power, with Blair's government legislating to create antisocial behaviour orders, or Asbos. Starmer has just hired a veteran of the Blair years, Matthew Doyle, to be his temporary director of communications, as longstanding aide Ben Nunn departs. Labour also confirmed that another close Starmer ally, Jenny Chapman, is moving to a frontbench position in the House of Lords, shadowing the government's Brexit minister, David Frost. The moves are part of a thorough shake-up of the Labour leader's backroom operation, with more changes expected to be announced after next week's Batley and Spen byelection.",Real Guardian,563.0
664,Real,The Guardian,"Scientists advising the government on research into pilot mass events such as concerts and sports matches are frustrated at the delay in making the findings public and have been pressing for them to be released, the Guardian has learned. Some of the events, which have included the Download music festival, the snooker world championships and a club night in Liverpool, took place as long ago as April and government sources say the results have been encouraging.  Expert advisers from the project's scientific board contacted by the Guardian expressed frustration at the fact the research findings had not yet been released and said they were keen for them to be published imminently. The organisers of summer events and the owners of music and sports venues are eagerly awaiting the findings, but Downing Street is still unable to say when they will be published. Boris Johnson's spokesperson said only that they would come ""shortly"". The shadow culture secretary, Jo Stevens, said event organisers had told her the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) had produced a report with positive findings, but it had been held up by No 10, which was reluctant to cut across the cautious messaging it has stuck to since delaying the 21 June reopening. Stevens said: ""This government has ignored and insulted the industry who spent money, time and resources helping them to run the events research programme. The sector urgently needs to know what the evidence shows, what they can do safely and how they will be permitted to do it to avoid further cancellations."" The government is facing legal action from music industry figures including the composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and the impresario Cameron Mackintosh, who are trying to force disclosure of the research. ""We simply must now see the data that is being used to strangle our industry so unfairly,"" Lloyd Webber said in a statement. ""The government's actions are forcing theatre and music companies off a cliff as the summer wears on, whilst cherrypicking high-profile sporting events to go ahead. The situation is beyond urgent."" The chief executive of the trade body UK Music, Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, said: ""It's absolutely critical we can see the results of the research programme, so we can understand the conditions there are going to be for us as a sector. Without that we won't be having a summer of music festivals."" Johnson's official spokesperson said: ""These pilots provide real-life data so we can fully understand any benefits, problems or challenges with mass events."" Asked why the findings had not been published, he said: ""We're assessing the evidence as we speak."" They were likely to appear shortly, he added. The DCMS is overseeing the testing programme, and a board of scientific experts have been analysing the data. The findings are expected to include advice for the organisers of future events on issues such as distancing and ventilation. Participants were tested in the run-up to the events and again afterwards. The events research programme report is one of four studies announced when the reopening roadmap for England was first published in February. All are expected to be published as the final lifting of restrictions approaches. The other studies cover the use of Covid certificates to facilitate reopening, the future of social distancing advice such as the ""1 metre plus"" rule, and options for international travel. Downing Street has signalled that it expects most formal regulations to be lifted on 19 July, what the prime minister has called the ""terminus"" date on which the final stage of the roadmap is due to come into force. Working from home guidance is expected to be scrapped, for example, with the emphasis placed instead on personal responsibility. Masks may be recommended in specific circumstances but are unlikely to be legally required.",Real Guardian,629.0
665,Real,The Guardian,"To disgruntled Labour MPs, they're known as the Gang of Five, or the Camden Set: Keir Starmer's close-knit team of handpicked aides, some of whom are based in his local north London patch. When he took over as Labour leader, with the country in lockdown, Starmer entrusted many of the key jobs in his office to longtime, trusted aides.  Director of communications Ben Nunn, who lives in Starmer's constituency, had been at his side through the tribulations of Labour's Brexit civil war; while political director Jenny Chapman backed him for the leadership even before he had decided to run. His deputy chief of staff Chris Ward also worked with Starmer through the lean Jeremy Corbyn years, as long ago as the 2017 general election when the then shadow Brexit secretary was travelling the country buoying the spirits of anxious Labour MPs in vulnerable seats and styling himself ""captain marginal"". Chief of staff Morgan McSweeney and policy director Claire Ainsley were more recent additions to the Starmer operation, joining him as he took on the leadership. But the five quickly became seen by MPs as a powerful clique, with more influence over many key strategic decisions even than most shadow cabinet members. Some MPs even complained they had less idea of what was going on in the leader of the opposition's office – known at Westminster by the abbreviation Loto – than during the Jeremy Corbyn years, when elements of the parliamentary party were frequently pitted against the leadership. But it appears all that is about to change. Three of the ""Gang"" – political director Jenny Chapman, chief of staff Morgan McSweeney, and director of communications Ben Nunn – are being shifted aside in a major shake-up of Starmer's office. Chapman will take on a frontbench role, McSweeney will shift to focus on campaigns – and Nunn is leaving altogether. Labour insiders say the aim is to professionalise Starmer's operation, and to put the party on a political war footing, with the next general election likely to be at most two years away, potentially even sooner. There has been no suggestion as yet that Ward or Ainsley could be for the chop; but party sources are clear that more changes are in the offing, with political big hitters expected to be brought into key posts. Labour MPs welcome the idea of a sharper, election-ready operation – but the question they were asking themselves on Tuesday, as the news about Chapman's long-rumoured move emerged, was what, if anything, the shift means for Labour policy. Starmer has struggled to make political headway in the extraordinary pandemic period, with headlines dominated by the severe restrictions on daily life – and more recently by the vaccine rollout. His shadow cabinet supporters point out the party has actually published a slew of policy ideas – including its own education catchup plan, and big-spending proposals on subsidising electric cars, for example – but they have not been able to cut through the Covid noise. Yet backbench critics say they still do not know what Starmer's Labour stands for – and are agitating for the announcement of a few symbolic, headline-grabbing policies, to make that clearer both to voters and longtime supporters. It will be unclear until the dust settles whether the aloofness and lack of big ideas Starmer's internal critics have complained about lie with his ultra-loyal gang of aides – or, as Tory MPs realised when they forced Theresa May to sack her key advisers, with the leader.",Real Guardian,583.0
666,Real,The Guardian,"Keir Starmer's executive director of communications and longstanding aide Ben Nunn is to leave his post, as part of a shake-up of the Labour leader's team. Nunn, 33, who lives in Starmer's north London constituency, has worked with him since he was shadow Brexit secretary on Jeremy Corbyn's frontbench.  He played a senior role in Starmer's leadership campaign last year, and has been involved in strategic political decisions as well as communications. In a message to Labour staff on Friday seen by the Guardian, Nunn said: ""It has been the privilege of my life to work for Keir these past four years and to help elect him to be Leader of the Labour party. I remain as convinced today as I ever have been that he will be a great prime minister and make this a better, stronger, more prosperous country."" He said he wanted to ""go forward and do something different"". Another senior member of Labour's press team, Paul Ovenden, will also depart at the same time. Both have told friends there are personal reasons behind their decisions to step aside now. The Guardian understands Nunn remains on good terms with Starmer, who left the door open to a future return. Theirs are the latest departures after Starmer's parliamentary private secretary Carolyn Harris, who liaised with backbench MPs, stepped down in the wake of the local elections. Questions were raised about Labour's media strategy after the party's faltering response to last month's defeat at the Hartlepool byelection. Over the weekend that followed the result, Angela Rayner's allies accused Starmer's team of briefing the media that the deputy leader would be moved aside – something Starmer's office vehemently denied. Nunn and Ovenden's departures coincide with the imminent arrival of Starmer's new director of strategy, the veteran pollster Deborah Mattinson, who is expected to start her role next month. The Labour leader will now also have to recruit a new communications director. Starmer has been dogged in recent months by internal criticism that he has failed to spell out what the party stands for under his leadership.",Real Guardian,347.0
667,Real,The Guardian,"Goodbye red wall, hello blue wall. The Liberal Democrats have been arguing for some time now that the outcome of the next general election will be determined not just by what happens in former Labour-held seats in the north of England, but by whether the Conservatives can hold on to their own heartlands farther south. Friday morning's shock result in leafy Chesham and Amersham suggests that keeping Boris Johnson's 2019 election-winning coalition together may be much more of a challenge than Conservative headquarters had thought.  According to a recent analysis by the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe, there are 23 seats – most of them in southern England – which the Lib Dems could take from the Tories on a 10% swing. They include Dominic Raab's Esher and Walton seat, Jeremy Hunt's in South West Surrey and Stephen Hammond's in Wimbledon. The Chesham and Amersham result was a much larger 25-point swing. Of course, byelection results are rarely replicated in a general election, when challenger parties cannot pour all their resources into a single seat. But the outcome appeared to be a clear signal of unease in the shires, and sparked alarm among MPs whose seats could be vulnerable. There were early warning signs for the Conservatives in the recent local election results, with the Lib Dems making gains across the commuter belt, including in Buckinghamshire. But on Friday, delighted Lib Dem activists said even they were surprised at the extent of disillusionment they had heard on the doorsteps. Johnson's Conservatives occupy a very different ideological position from their Cameronian predecessors. They are less liberal on social issues, less cautious on the public finances – and less constrained by the traditional Tory values that saw Theresa May stick with the 0.7% foreign aid target Johnson has ditched (temporarily, he says). The expulsion of a string of well-known liberal Tories – including Dominic Grieve, whose Beaconsfield constituency is next door to Amersham and Chesham – as Johnson bulldozed his way to Brexit underlined publicly just how much the party had changed. At the 2019 general election, with Brexit still a live issue, and the Tories able to argue that a vote for the Lib Dems could ""let Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street"", the Conservative vote held up relatively well in the south – with rare exceptions such as St Albans, which went yellow. But while they have been focusing their political energy on the red wall – taking Hartlepool from Labour last month, for example – it appears the other end of the Tories' electoral coalition is now fraying. Johnson himself was quick to point to ""particular circumstances"" in Chesham and Amersham – a remark aides suggested referred to the bitter local antipathy to the HS2 rail project, which passes through the Chilterns. But perhaps, too, the relentless focus on ""levelling up"" means relatively prosperous areas in the south, which the Tories have held for many years, now feel taken for granted. The individual policy that best exemplifies the repositioning under way under Johnson is his radical planning reforms, aimed at taking on Nimbies, to boost housebuilding and win over a new generation of voters. The plans, which would make it harder for local people to object to developments once a top-down zoning has taken place, have infuriated traditional Conservatives, including May. An alliance of Conservative backbenchers, many but not all representing southern seats, now believe they can defeat the plans when the bill comes to parliament. No 10 is bullish – but planning looks set to become the next flashpoint in the battle for the soul of the Tory party. For Ed Davey, who has struggled to put his party on the political map since winning the leadership, the timing of this result could not be better. After a shattering couple of years, in which Jo Swinson went from posting leaflets through thousands of doors introducing herself as the next prime minister, to losing her own seat, the Lib Dems are back in the game.",Real Guardian,667.0
668,Real,The Guardian,"The leftwinger Howard Beckett has pulled out of the race to succeed Len McCluskey as general secretary of the Unite union at the last minute to throw his weight behind the frontrunner Steve Turner. Beckett announced the decision on Friday as ballot papers were about to be printed. It followed failed talks earlier in the week to select a leftwing unity candidate to take on Gerard Coyne.  In a joint statement, Beckett and Turner said they would work together to produce a ""blended manifesto, taking the best ideas from both candidates"". ""Howard Beckett has decided he will support Steve Turner as Unite's next general secretary,"" the statement said. ""Both recognise the vision and strengths of their respective campaigns and Steve Turner recognises the key manifesto commitments and energy generated by Howard's campaign."" A third leftwing candidate, Sharon Graham, is not expected to withdraw her name. Peace talks between the three broke down without agreement earlier in the week, and Beckett had suggested drawing a name at random to decide who should stand. Turner won the most nominations to secure his place on the ballot paper, with 525, but Graham surprised many by coming second with 349 and Beckett came third with 328. McCluskey's supporters fear a Coyne win would mean Unite abandoning its staunch backing of leftwing causes, and reduce the left's influence on Labour policy. Unite under McCluskey was intricately entwined with Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour party. He was a vocal backer, his close friend Karie Murphy served as Corbyn's chief of staff and Unite's chief of staff, Andrew Murray, was seconded as a part-time adviser to the Labour leader. McCluskey has been a strong critic of Keir Starmer and his style of leadership. Beckett, the union's former legal adviser who was recently suspended from Labour for saying Priti Patel should be deported rather than refugees, has been a close aide to McCluskey. He advocates an increase in the union's strike fund from £40m to £50m. Turner, who has also been close to McCluskey, was seen as the favourite to win after securing the support of the United Left faction. He has argued for more pragmatism from the union's leaders. The 2017 battle for the Unite leadership was hugely divisive and led to Coyne being suspended from his position in the union.",Real Guardian,386.0
669,Real,The Guardian,"Jacob Rees-Mogg has leapt to the defence of Matt Hancock, telling MPs the health secretary is a ""successful genius"". Hancock came under a fresh onslaught from Boris Johnson's former adviser Dominic Cummings on Wednesday.  In a rambling blogpost, Cummings published private messages, in which the prime minister called the health secretary's performance ""totally fucking hopeless"". During Rees-Mogg's weekly appearance at the dispatch box in the House of Commons on Thursday, he was asked about Cummings' claims by his Labour shadow, Thangam Debbonaire. ""Why did the prime minister keep on as health secretary someone he thought was hopeless in a global health crisis?"" she said. ""The British people recognise incompetence and waste when they see it. They know what's right and what's not and they know when a minister is hopeless."" Rees-Mogg replied by suggesting messages of the kind published by Cummings are ""essentially the trivia, the flotsam and jetsam, the ephemera of life, and they're fundamentally unimportant"". And he went on to call Hancock, ""the brilliant, the one and only successful genius who has been running health over the last 15 months"", adding that ""he has done so much to make not only the country but the world safer"". Number 10 insisted Johnson had full confidence in Hancock after Cummings' latest claims. When a journalist shouted a question at Hancock's ministerial car about whether he was ""hopeless,"" the health secretary replied: ""I don't think so."" Cummings had previously claimed during a lengthy appearance before the health and science select committees that Hancock had repeatedly lied during the crisis, giving colleagues including Johnson false reassurances about issues including testing capacity and care homes. Cummings subsequently failed to provide documentary evidence to the committees to back up his claims. But he published a string of private messages and government briefing documents on Wednesday, as he continues to accuse Downing Street of trying to rewrite the history of the crisis. The health select committee chair, Jeremy Hunt, who was Hancock's predecessor as health secretary, said after Cummings' latest allegations, that he had not seen anything that proved outright the claim that the health secretary had lied. The joint health and science committees are expected to publish a report on the lessons of the government's handling of the pandemic before the summer recess.

670,Real,The Guardian,"Keir Starmer has picked the election slogan of US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, ""Stronger Together"", to badge the wide-ranging policy review that will lay the groundwork for Labour's next manifesto. Party chair Anneliese Dodds said the ""Stronger Together"" overhaul, which she will oversee, would focus on channelling the solidarity shown by the British public during the pandemic.  Dodds, who was put in charge of reviewing Labour policy after last month's fraught reshuffle, accused the government of failing to learn the lessons of the crisis. ""One of the frustrating aspects of the Conservatives' approach is that they haven't learned from the things that were achieved in this period, and thought about how they can help all of us for the future,"" she said. Citing collective projects, from communities banding together to buy neighbours' shopping, to the state-backed development of the AstraZeneca vaccine, Dodds said a Labour government would build on this spirit of togetherness. As well as being widely used by Clinton in 2016, the ""Stronger Together"" strapline is reminiscent of both the ""Better Together"" slogan used by the no campaign in the 2014 Scottish referendum, and ""Stronger In"", the name of the failed anti-Brexit campaign two years later. But Dodds said the idea harked back to the party's founding principles. ""That recognition that we're stronger together is at the foundation of the Labour party,"" she said. ""That's why we were founded as a party, because we knew that."" Clinton reportedly looked at 84 other slogans before adopting Stronger Together, alongside I'm With Her. A Labour aide pointed out that the full title of Dodds's review is ""Stronger Together: A Better Future for Britain"". Dodds's policy ""roadmap,"" which is expected to take more than 18 months to carry out, will cover six broad areas, including ""a green and digital future,"" ""Britain in the world,"" and ""public services that work from the start"". Labour leftwingers have called on Starmer to use the 2019 manifesto, drawn up under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, as a starting point. But Dodds said that had never been the party's practice. ""The Labour party obviously creates its manifesto anew, every time that there's an election. That happened in 2019, 2017, 2015, 2010. It's always happened."" Under the heading of ""putting families first"", she said her review would build on work done by shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Reynolds on overhauling the welfare system. ""Our social security system just doesn't fit people's working lives currently at all,"" she said. ""We know that the majority of children that are growing up in poverty are in working households. Clearly something is going very wrong there."" Dodds and Starmer will visit Airbus in Bristol on Thursday to launch the review formally, and hear about how the company used test aircraft to fly in PPE for frontline staff. Starmer said, ""When the pandemic hit Britain was too divided. We were too fractured as a country after a decade of the Conservatives. That meant we weren't as well prepared as we could have been, so the pandemic hit us harder."" But he said the British people had responded by stepping up to help their communities, and ""Labour wants to harness that spirit to start building a better future for everyone in Britain."" Labour has published several detailed policies on tackling the pandemic – such as its own more generous alternative to the government's schools catch-up plan, for example. But with the next general election likely to be held in 2023 at the earliest, the party is wary of setting out forward-looking plans. Gaya Sriskanthan, co-chair of the leftwing Labour campaign group Momentum, said it was time to move beyond soundbites, however. ""Labour needs more than a few platitudes,"" she said. ""We need a vision for a different country and a willingness to call out inequality and the power of the richest."" A separate policy review, announced by Starmer in December and chaired by former prime minister Gordon Brown, will look at the constitutional makeup of the UK. It is expected to outline a new settlement in Scotland, potentially with more powers devolved to Holyrood and beyond that to local authorities. Dodds said it was for Scottish Labour, under new leader Anas Sarwar, to determine the party's position on Scottish independence. But as a Scot herself, she said, ""I really do believe that we've got a shared history and a shared future as well"". She said one task of the review would be to ask: ""What is our national story for the UK?"" Dodds was replaced by Rachel Reeves last month, as Starmer reshuffled his team after the embarrassing loss of the Hartlepool byelection. Asked how it felt to be told she had to leave her post, she is philosophical. ""You've got to take the rough with the smooth, haven't you, in politics? Keir is ultimately the manager of the football team, he decides who goes where. I'm just glad I can make a contribution in a different way, hopefully."" ",Real Guardian,827.0
671,Real,The Guardian,"Delivering his closing press conference in the Carbis Bay hotel on Sunday, pale golden sand and azure sea visible behind him, Boris Johnson sought to play down the unseemly diplomatic spat that had marred his moment on the world stage. ""Actually, what happened at this summit was that there was a colossal amount of work on subjects that had absolutely nothing to do with Brexit,"" he insisted.  Yet just hours earlier, his foreign secretary had been describing alleged comments by the French president about the status of Northern Ireland as ""offensive"". French sources flatly denied that Emmanuel Macron had been suggesting Northern Ireland was not part of the UK – they said he was merely pointing out it is not part of Great Britain (and, indeed, Northern Ireland has a special status under the protocol – which is of course why it exists). Whatever the truth, Johnson's bilateral meetings this weekend were repeatedly kiboshed by discussion of the ugly standoff over checks on products exported from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Rather than play down the row, the prime minister repeatedly leaned into it – saying he needed EU leaders to ""get it into their heads,"" that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, for example. The UK insists the EU is being too legalistic in how it interprets the protocol; but other G7 countries could have been excused for coming away with the impression that ""Global Britain"" cannot even get on with its nearest neighbours, and signs up to deals only to try to wriggle out of them later. Away from sausage wars, there were new commitments from the G7 on boosting girls' education, preventing future pandemics and safeguarding biodiversity. And there was a renewed sense that global cooperation is suddenly achievable again, in a way that was simply impossible in the Trump era, as illustrated by the minimum global tax deal struck by G7 finance ministers last week. But on the two most pressing issues the world faces – the climate emergency and the pandemic – campaigners were bitterly disappointed by the scale of ambition on display. The 1bn vaccine doses the G7 agreed to donate falls far short of the 11bn the World Health Organization's Tedros Adhanom says are necessary to protect 70% of the world population. He would also like to see the donation deadline brought forward to next summer, from Johnson's target of the end of 2022. On climate, the G7 reiterated a decade-old promise to ""mobilise"" $100bn a year in financing, first made at the Copenhagen summit, which has already been about 80% reached. Leaders did commit to increasing their contributions to hit that total – but it was hardly the green Marshall Plan some reports had trailled. They said they would ""develop a plan"" for a clean, green financing mechanism intended to rival massive Chinese investment into developing countries – but details were scant. Like several announcements over the weekend, the headline appeared not to be backed up with policy detail. At his press conference, Johnson bristled at the idea that the UK's aid cuts may have undermined his moral authority to press other G7 countries to be more generous, whether on green finance or vaccines. He insisted no leader had brought up the issue of the cuts with him at the summit: and wrongly stated that the UK remained the second biggest donor in the G7 (it is the fifth). But somehow, whether it was lack of diplomatic groundwork in advance, or the lack of trust created by the Brexit row, Johnson's moment in the Cornish sunshine didn't quite come off. When it comes to Cop26 in Glasgow in November, when it is not just the wealthiest nations but the whole world the UK must cajole and persuade to back an ambitious climate deal, the challenges will be even greater, and the stakes very much higher.",Real Guardian,645.0
672,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson has dropped a heavy hint that the final lifting of lockdown restrictions in England will be delayed by up to a month, as the government prepares to make a final decision over the weekend. The prime minister, who is hosting the G7 summit in Cornwall, is due to announce on Monday whether stage four of his Covid roadmap can go ahead as planned on 21 June.  With cases of the Delta variant that was first identified in India continuing to increase rapidly, a four-week delay is now widely expected, potentially with a break clause at two weeks. Asked by ITV's Robert Peston whether there would be a delay, Johnson said: ""We're setting out the position on Monday, but what I can certainly tell you is that to deliver an irreversible roadmap you've got to be cautious."" He added: ""We're still looking at the data, we're seeing unquestionably not just cases but also hospitalisations going up. There will be arguments about the extent to which they're going up, the extent to which that is feeding into fatalities. But in order to deliver an irreversible roadmap, you've got to be cautious."" The delay would be used to buy time to measure the impact of infections on hospital admissions and give more people their second vaccine dose. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has signalled to allies that he would not oppose such a delay, believing it would be worse for businesses if restrictions were lifted now only to be reimposed later. 21 June was meant to be what Conservative MPs have dubbed ""freedom day"", when all legal limits on social gatherings were due to be removed, mass events given the go-ahead and some businesses including nightclubs allowed to reopen for the first time since March last year. Vaccination provides strong protection against the Delta variant, particularly after two doses, but experts have become increasingly concerned at its rapid spread among younger, unvaccinated people. Johnson rejected the idea that he was partly to blame for the rapid spread of the Delta variant having failed to put India on the red list until 23 April, two weeks after Pakistan and Bangladesh were added. At the time, the prime minister was planning a visit to Delhi at the invitation of the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, which he subsequently cancelled as the situation in India deteriorated. Challenged by the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg about whether India should have been added to the red list earlier, the prime minister said the government had done so ""before the variant had even been identified as a variant under investigation, let alone identified as a variant of concern. And that variant is now widely seeded around the world"".",Real Guardian,449.0

""It's fair to say it may well come up,"" Johnson's spokesperson said. Von Der Leyen and Michel are expected to stress the serious potential consequences of failing to find a resolution in the coming days, putting the onus on the UK to compromise. But Johnson's spokesperson said he in turn would want to convey the ""challenges"", the protocol is bringing to the people of Northern Ireland, and ""the risks it poses to the agreement in the current form, and the need to find urgent solutions"". The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, also struck a defiant tone on Friday, accusing the EU of being unnecessarily rigid in the way it is interpreting the agreement, which the UK signed up to. Raab told Sky News that in order for the dispute over the protocol to be resolved, ""the EU must be less purist, more pragmatic and more flexible in the implementation of it. The ball is very much in the EU's court in relation to that. ""The bottom line for us is that the threat, the risk to the Good Friday agreement, comes from the approach the EU has taken,"" he added.

674,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson has told his fellow G7 leaders in Cornwall they should avoid repeating the mistakes of 2008, when the recovery from the deep recession that followed the financial crisis entrenched inequalities. In his opening remarks to the first formal session of the three-day summit, Johnson said: ""It is vital that we don't repeat the mistakes of the last great crisis, the last big economic recession of 2008, when the recovery was not uniform across all part of society.""  His comments appeared to be a repudiation of his own party's policies, when a decade of austerity was imposed on public services and welfare benefits after 2010. Peppering his remarks with Conservative slogans about ""building back better"" and ""levelling up"", Johnson also said the G7 should rebuild their economies ""in a more gender-neutral, a more feminine, way"". ""What's gone wrong with this pandemic, what risks being a lasting scar is, the inequalities that have been entrenched. We need to make sure that as we recover, we level up across our societies – we need to build back better,"" he said. The prime minister was not an MP during the 2010-15 Tory-Lib Dem coalition government that blamed Labour overspending for the crisis and imposed swingeing cuts; but he stood for election in 2015 on a manifesto that included a £12bn reduction in the welfare bill. The shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Bridget Phillipson, said: ""It's absurd to see Boris Johnson talk about not repeating mistakes, when he and the Conservatives spent the last decade cutting our public services to the bone, leaving British businesses out in the cold and weakening the foundations of our economy. ""Instead of learning from its mistakes, this Tory government is caught in a cycle of trying to clean up its own mess."" Johnson's official spokesperson said his reference to a more ""feminine"" recovery reflected the commitment to boosting girls' education – something G7 leaders have also promised to do. But the TUC's general secretary, Frances O'Grady, ridiculed Johnson's remarks. ""Boris Johnson's musings on femininity are a mystery. But it would be a big macho mistake to think 'more feminine' means accepting a 1% pay cap for the NHS,"" she said. As well as discussing how to rebuild their economies after the deep recession caused by the pandemic, G7 leaders will sign a new agreement on Saturday aimed at ensuring such an outbreak can never happen again. The Carbis Bay declaration will include commitments to step up research into zoonotic diseases, those which jump from animals to humans. The UK will establish an animal vaccine manufacturing and innovation centre at the Pirbright Institute in Surrey, expected to be up and running next year. G7 leaders will be joined by the Indian, South Korean, Australian and South African delegations – attending the G7 at the UK's invitation – for their discussions about health. They will be shown a presentation by the UK government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, and Melinda French Gates on the work of the Pandemic Preparedness Partnership, a group of international experts advising the G7 on detecting and preventing future outbreaks. Their recommendations include cutting the time taken to develop and license vaccines, treatments and diagnostics for any future disease to less than 100 days, and reinforcing global surveillance networks to identify and track new pandemic threats. The prime minister said: ""I am proud that for the first time today the world's leading democracies have come together to make sure that never again will we be caught unawares."" In his opening remarks at the summit he said mistakes had been made in the past 18 months, though did not specify what they were.

675,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson has claimed the UK has an ""indestructible relationship"" with the US, after his bilateral meeting on Thursday with President Joe Biden. The prime minister is known not to be keen on the well-worn phrase ""special relationship"", believing it makes the UK look weak.  But in an interview with the BBC after the pair met, he sought to underscore the closeness between the two nations, despite Biden's concerns about the damaging standoff with the EU over the Northern Ireland protocol. ""Look, I don't mind the phrase 'special relationship' because it is special. But you know, it encompasses a reality which is that the UK and the US have a real congruence of views on some stuff that really matters to the world. And so we believe very strongly in democracy, we believe in human rights, we believe in the rules-based international order, we believe in the transatlantic alliance,"" Johnson said. Asked what he would call the connection between the two countries, he said, ""you can call it the 'deep and meaningful relationship', whatever you want, the 'indestructible relationship'. It's a relationship that has endured for a very long time, and has been an important part of peace and prosperity both in Europe and around the world."" Johnson denied Biden had told him to resolve the standoff with the EU over the Northern Ireland protocol, instead reiterating the importance to both the UK and the US of the Good Friday/Belfast agreement. It emerged as Biden arrived in the UK that senior US diplomats had warned the UK's combative Brexit negotiator, David Frost, that his actions risked inflaming tensions in Northern Ireland. Lord Frost will attend the G7 summit on Friday. Asked about the row with the EU, Johnson said repeatedly that the two sides would ""sort it out"". But the prime minister appeared to criticise the EU's approach to implementing the protocol. ""There are ways of enforcing the protocol, ways of making it work, that may be excessively burdensome,"" he said. ""I just give you one statistic: 20% of the checks conducted across the whole of the perimeter of the EU are now done in Northern Ireland, three times as many as happen in Rotterdam."" Pressed on whether an agreement could be reached over the weekend, with EU chiefs and the French, German and Italian leaders present, he said the summit would be focused on other questions. ""No, no, no, no. We're focusing here on a huge range of things that the G7 wants to look at. So we're looking at the post-pandemic world, we're looking at what we can do to make sure that we don't have the world caught unprepared again, or the western world anyway, for a pandemic in the way that we were."" After the meeting with Biden, the UK promised to continue working with the EU to find a solution – but is also not ruling out taking unilateral action. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said as he prepared to fly to Cornwall that ""nothing is negotiable"" about the protocol. A ban on chilled meats including sausages and mincemeat being exported from Great Britain into Northern Ireland, which abides by EU agrifood rules, is due to come into force on 30 June.

Leaders are expected to be greeted on the beach at Carbis bay near St Ives on Friday by the prime minister and his new wife – the pair married on 29 May. They were pictured overlooking the sea on Thursday alongside Joe Biden and his wife, Jill. Biden later joked that both men had married ""above our stations"". Wednesday: UK prime ministerBoris Johnson travels down to Cornwall after prime minister's questions in parliament. US President Joe Biden arrives in the UK Thursday: Johnson and Biden hold a bilateral meeting at an undisclosed Cornish location Friday: G7 leaders arrive and the summit begins. Joining the US and the UK will be leaders from Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. Saturday: discussions continue – topics expected to be covered over the weekend include climate change, the challenge posed by China and Russia, the recovery from Covid, and the urgent need to vaccinate the world's population Sunday: final summit communique published, leaders hold press conferences before departing for a NATO summit in Brussels on Monday Friday evening will be a relatively formal affair: the G7 leaders will attend a reception with the Prince of Wales and international business leaders at the Eden Project to discuss his ""sustainable markets initiative"". The leaders and their spouses will then meet the Queen at a reception, with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge also present. The recently bereaved monarch will then leave, and the leaders will remain at the Eden Project, with its vast glass biomes and indoor rainforest, for a dinner cooked by Emily Scott of the Watergate Bay Hotel. They are expected to eat spiced melon gazpacho with coconut, roasted Cornish turbot caught off Newquay – at which Johnson may have to resist a Brexit reference – a selection of Cornish cheeses, a strawberry pavlova and petits fours featuring clotted cream fudge. On Saturday night, the G7 leaders will skirt Covid rules about indoor gatherings by taking to the beach for an informal barbecue – though unlike most beach cook-ups it will feature a fly-past by the Red Arrows. Number 10 said catering would be by Simon Stallard of the Hidden Hut, a popular food kiosk on Porthcurnick beach. The menu will feature canapes including scallops, crab claws and mackerel, a main course of seared and smoked sirloin with lobster, and a dessert of ""beach hut sundae"". They will then be seated around firepits, and served buttered rum and toasted marshmallows. They will be serenaded by the Du Hag Owr shantymen from the Roseland peninsula – sea shanties being popular in this part of the world long before the lockdown craze brought them to the attention of a much wider audience. Throughout the weekend, the G7 spouses including Carrie Johnson will take part in a separate itinerary of visits and events.

But this particular beach party appears unlikely to end up with a dip.",Real Guardian,575.0
677,Real,The Guardian,"When Boris Johnson selected Cornwall as the venue for this weekend's G7 summit, he must have imagined greeting the world's leaders against the backdrop of a blazing blue sky on the English riviera, while getting to grips with the great global challenges of climate breakdown and Covid. Instead, his first face-to-face meeting with Joe Biden on Thursday had to be moved from the picturesque St Michael's Mount to the conference hotel in Carbis Bay, because of the Cornish mizzle – and Brexit was frustratingly high on the agenda.  The summit was meant to mark the arrival on the world stage of a newly emboldened, diplomatically nimble UK, no longer a member of the EU, but internationalist nevertheless. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, a committed Brexiter, said recently that instead of ""some big cumbersome whale"", the UK could now be ""a more agile dolphin"". There is a shift in priorities, too: Johnson's recent integrated review of defence and strategic policy signalled a new ""Indo-Pacific tilt"", and to that end Australia and India will be attending part of the summit – though the Delhi delegation will do so remotely. And for Johnson, this weekend was intended as a moment to showcase the statesmanlike qualities his allies insist he possesses. But as he tries to remodel the UK in the eyes of the world, Johnson continues to be dogged by the painful details of implementing the historic policy with which he will for ever be most associated: Brexit. Even Johnson's most ardent defenders concede that he is not a details man, or a completer-finisher. He operates through colourful political gestures: driving a JCB through a wall of polystyrene blocks emblazoned with the message ""Get Brexit Done"", for example. ""For the prime minister, for Boris Johnson, the performance matters far more than the substance: strutting the world stage. This is performative politics,"" says Anand Menon, the director of thinktank UK in a Changing Europe. Or as an article by political scientists at the University of Southampton recently called it, ""the politics of spectacle"". But his fellow leaders appear unwilling to allow him to sweep aside the trade dispute over the status of the Irish border. As Biden flew in on Wednesday, it emerged that his administration has been warning the UK that it wants to see the increasingly bitter spat between the UK and the EU over the Northern Ireland protocol urgently resolved. David Frost, the cabinet minister responsible for negotiating with the EU, was a late addition to the G7 guest list, as Downing Street acknowledged that, like the mizzle, the subject would be unavoidable. The UK will fear that the standoff over implementing the protocol will overshadow efforts to persuade the G7 to pull together on other pressing issues. The EU's position, that the UK must implement the deal Johnson signed up to, is likely to be forcefully reiterated by the EU Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the European Council president, Charles Michel, when they meet the prime minister. And while the EU's point-man on the protocol, Maroš Šefčovič, didn't quite say so directly on Wednesday, there is an increasing whiff of bad faith – a fear that the UK signed up to a deal it never had any intention of abiding by. Von Der Leyen insisted on Thursday that Johnson must abide by the ""rule of law"". Number 10 was stressing on Thursday that the G7 summit was not about Brexit, and there were much bigger issues at stake, including the climate crisis and the urgent need to vaccinate the world's poorest against Covid. One senior Tory source said optimistically that Friday was intended to be ""save the world day"", with the recovery from the pandemic on the agenda. The shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, agreed there were much wider issues at stake. ""It's an important moment. It's perhaps the most historic G7 in a generation, not just because of Covid, but because of climate change. This will be the moment when we will find out whether the G7 can lay the groundwork for an agreement at Cop26 [the climate summit being hosted by the UK] in five months' time. Much of the work is done in the run-up to major summits like these, with the UK's Jonathan Black the key figure in the behind-the-scenes G7 negotiations. But goodwill and trust are essential in oiling the wheels of global agreements – and certainly in making them stick when the summit hotels empty out and the leaders return home. There appears to be precious little of either when it comes to Johnson. He had a notable rapport with Biden's predecessor, who dubbed him ""Britain Trump"" – though allies insist it was just that Johnson knew how to ""handle"" the notoriously unpredictable president. They claim this is a skill he can extend to very different leaders, too, including Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel. Yet Nandy says contacts in foreign ministries around the world have told her they feel the UK has simply left the field when it comes to a string of challenges, such as unrest in the Middle East.",Real Guardian,849.0
678,Real,The Guardian,"Conservative backbencher Steve Baker has urged the government to press ahead with lifting England's remaining Covid restrictions on 21 June despite a sharp rise in cases. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said in the House of Commons that ministers faced a ""challenging decision"" about whether to proceed as planned with the final stage of the government's roadmap.  The latest official UK data shows 35,796 people have tested positive for the virus over the past week, up 52.9% on a week earlier. Deaths were up just 1.7% over the week, however, at 59. Baker, vice-chair of the Covid Recovery Group of backbench MPs, said 21 June represented a ""last chance"" for industries including hospitality and tourism, that ""make life worth living,"" and it was time to allow the public to ""reconnect with family and friends and regain our mental health"". He claimed that by that date, all over-50s and vulnerable younger adults should have been given the opportunity to receive two doses of Covid vaccine. ""These groups represent about 99% of Covid deaths and about 80% of hospitalisations,"" he said. ""As of today, according to announcements made by the government, these groups should all have been offered a chance to have had a second dose. It would be helpful for the government to clarify that this has been achieved. ""If this brilliant milestone isn't enough to convince ministers that we need to lift all remaining restrictions – especially social distancing requirements – on 21 June, nothing will ever get us out of this."" Baker's intervention underlines the pressure the prime minister faces from colleagues as he weighs up whether to delay the final lifting of restrictions until more people can be protected. The government has previously said it intends all adults to have been offered two doses of the vaccine by the end of July. Hancock has warned that the Delta variant of the virus, which was first detected in India, appears to be around 40% more transmissible than the previous strain. Some experts have warned that despite vaccination offering good protection against the variant, particularly after two doses, hospitalisations could still increase dramatically, in a way that could eventually threaten NHS capacity. The decision about whether to go ahead with the final stage of reopening is not expected to be announced until next Monday, after Boris Johnson has hosted world leaders for the G7 summit in Cornwall over the weekend. When the roadmap to reopening was first announced in February, Johnson set out four criteria for going ahead as planned, with one of those being ""our assessment of the risks is not fundamentally changed by new variants of concern"". But Tory backbenchers have dubbed 21 June ""freedom day,"" and will put intense pressure on the prime minister to go ahead with the final stage of reopening, despite the rise in cases. Johnson told colleagues at Tuesday's cabinet meeting: ""While the relationship between cases and hospitalisations has changed, we must continue to look at the data carefully ahead of making a decision on step 4."" This article was amended on 16 June 2021 to clarify that while the Delta variant was first detected in India, it is not known if it originated there as claimed in an earlier version.",Real Guardian,539.0
679,Real,The Guardian,"Michael Gove has said the decision about whether to introduce ""Covid certificates"" to allow events and venues to open up this summer remains ""finely balanced"". The Cabinet Office minister was asked to carry out a review of the potential for certification three months ago, when Boris Johnson announced his roadmap to reopening the economy.  Confirmation of people's vaccine and testing status – most likely through the NHS app – was initially envisaged as a way of allowing many venues such as pubs to reopen without social distancing. But, giving evidence to MPs on Thursday, Gove stressed the potential downsides of the approach, including ""the cost, and the hassle factor"". He said if the government does go ahead, the scheme would only apply temporarily, and to bigger sites such as sport venues and large nightclubs – and MPs would be given a vote on the proposal. Many libertarian Conservatives object to the idea – sometimes referred to as vaccine passports despite the fact they could also reflect testing status – on civil liberties grounds. He insisted the government was not ""locked on to"" the idea, and had been examining it ""pragmatically, to see if it can add value"". He added that 6 million people had already voluntarily downloaded the app, which is expected to be used to certify vaccination status for international travel. Gove said no final decision on the domestic uses of certification would be announced until 7 June at the earliest, when MPs return to Westminster from a week-long recess, and stressed it might not be introduced in time for the planned fourth stage of the roadmap, from 21 June. ""There's no absolute necessary ironclad inviolable link between the two. But, naturally, as we contemplate reopening at stage four, people will understandably want to know what our approach towards certification will be, and how that will work."" Gove and other senior government figures including deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam recently visited Israel to examine its green card system of vaccine certification. But Gove pointed out that Israel has now suspended the use of green cards, because vaccination rates are high enough and case rates low enough to make them unnecessary. He said that even if certification is introduced, he would expect it to be abolished again ""later this year or early next"", if the virus is sufficiently under control. At the start of the hearing with the public administration and constitutional affairs committee, Gove was challenged about Dominic Cummings' claim at his marathon seven-hour hearing on Wednesday that the Cabinet Office was ""terrifyingly shit"". Asked whether he agreed with that assessment of his department, Gove said ""no"". And he stressed the fact that many western democracies were ""learning in real time"" during the early days of the pandemic.",Real Guardian,461.0
680,Real,The Guardian,"The Conservative MP Rob Roberts, who was found to have sexually harassed a member of staff, has been suspended from the House of Commons for six weeks as the Commons leader stepped up the pressure on him by saying it would be ""honourable"" for him to resign. An independent panel found that Roberts had made repeated and unwanted sexual advances towards a former member of staff, as well as inappropriate comments of a sexual nature.  The MP for Delyn in north Wales has been stripped of the Tory whip after the panel's findings, published on Tuesday, and Labour had already called on him to step down immediately. His six-week suspension was confirmed on Thursday. However, the punishment will not trigger a potential recall, under which Roberts' constituents could remove him as an MP, because of a loophole in the Recall of MPs Act 2015. Opening the weekly business questions session in parliament on Thursday, the Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, announced he would open a discussion about whether the loophole could be closed for future cases. He said: ""Following a case of this severity, in which it would be honourable for a member to stand down after the withdrawal of the whip, we need to look at whether the process is striking the right balance between independence, protecting the confidentiality of complaints, and ensuring consistent outcomes across different types of conduct case."" He said he would ask the chair of the Independent Expert Panel (IEP), Sir Stephen Irwin, whether he thought the recall process should be triggered in future, similar cases – and that he hoped changes could be made without new legislation. The Labour MP Jess Phillips, who has supported several previous complainants in Westminster sexual harassment cases, said all of them she had spoken to believed the recall process should apply to Roberts' case. Roberts was reported by a former staff member who worked for him briefly in 2020, months after he was first elected in 2019. The person, who wishes to remain anonymous, told BBC Wales they were alone in a car together on a constituency visit when Roberts allegedly said: ""I find you very attractive and alluring and I need you to make attempts to be less alluring in the office because it's becoming very difficult for me."" Roberts told the panel his intention had been ""romantic"", not ""sexual"". Rees-Mogg said the original justification for not allowing cases judged by the IEP to trigger a recall was that the confidentiality of complainants could be put at risk during the six-week recall campaign, when constituents can sign a petition. If 10% of them do so, a byelection is triggered. The process was used to remove Fiona Onasanya as the Labour MP for Peterborough after she was found guilty ofperverting the course of justice. Chris Bryant, who chairs the Commons standards committee, welcomed Rees-Mogg's commitment to look at changing the rules. ""It makes absolute sense to rectify the anomaly, which looks as if it means we treat the misuse of stationery as more important than sexual harassment,"" he said.",Real Guardian,511.0
681,Real,The Guardian,"Late-night battles, expletive-ridden rants, Jaws references and Spiderman memes – the dramatic details of Dominic Cummings' seven-hour testimony captivated Westminster on Wednesday. But strip away all the chaos and colour, and the bleak picture left behind was of a prime minister utterly unsuited to the historic and unprecedented task he was handed.  Of course, Cummings is a deeply unreliable witness: self-interested, embittered about his departure from Downing Street and inconsistent – to put it generously – about his lockdown-busting trip to Durham. At times he appeared to be pursuing something close to a vendetta against the health secretary, Matt Hancock, whom he claimed to have repeatedly urged the prime minister to sack, and whom he accused of a litany of lies and other failures. Yet the broad thrust of his attack on Boris Johnson had the ring of plausibility, mainly because it chimed so squarely with much of what was already publicly known, from the botched early response to the pandemic to Johnson's refusal to order a September lockdown. On Wednesday Cummings put that narrative on the record and brought it alive, with added layers of excruciating detail. He described the prime minister's dogged refusal to listen to scientific advice or learn the lessons of the March lockdown. He told of Johnson's repeated references to ""the mayor from Jaws"" and his tendency to disappear off on holiday or become distracted at critical junctures. The prime minister was ""about a thousand times too obsessed with the media"" and ""changes his mind 10 times a day, and then calls up the media and contradicts his own policy, day after day after day"", Cummings said. Instead of a smooth-running machine, with the prime minister at the centre, Cummings claimed the cabinet was barely involved in key decisions, and went as far as saying that Johnson deliberately embraced political disorder. Cummings said Johnson told him last summer, when the senior aide was threatening to resign, that ""chaos isn't that bad: it means people have to look to me to see who is in charge"". Perhaps most damning, though, was Cummings' account of the autumn, when many scientific experts were calling for a circuit-breaker to prevent the virus running out of control after schools reopened. Unlike in March, when data was hard to come by and the pandemic was extremely novel, there was by now ample information as well as the hard-won experience gained from the spring lockdown. Cummings claimed the prime minister continued to insist, in the face of all the evidence, not only that another lockdown was not necessary but that the first one had been the wrong move, which he was somehow gulled into. ""There's this great misunderstanding people have that because it [Covid] nearly killed him, therefore he must have taken it seriously,"" Cummings said in a reference to the prime minister's brush with death in March 2020. ""But in fact, after the first lockdown, he was cross with me and others with what he regarded as basically pushing him into the first lockdown. His argument after that was: 'I should have been the mayor of Jaws and kept the beaches open.'"" Of course, Johnson did eventually order that second lockdown, at the end of October and several weeks later than advised. By this time, Cummings claimed, Johnson was so infuriated that he said he would rather see ""bodies pile up"" than implement a third lockdown – corroborating a report that the PM has denied. And, Cummings argued, the bodies did pile up across a year of poor decision-making. The official UK Covid death toll now stands at more than 127,000. Being prime minister doesn't just mean the Downing Street address and the cheering crowds: it carries the responsibility of life-and-death choices freighted with historical significance. That's the reason candidates for the job are often asked: ""Would you press the nuclear button?"" Once they disappear inside the big black door of No 10, the nation has no choice but to rely on their judgment as they make those life-and-death decisions. On Wednesday it was hard to listen to the man Johnson chose as his closest adviser and conclude that he made them well.",Real Guardian,693.0
682,Real,The Guardian,"Dominic Cummings has apologised for the mistakes Boris Johnson's government made during the Covid-19 pandemic, conceding that he and his colleagues disastrously failed the British public. The prime minister's former chief adviser was giving evidence to the cross-party health and science and technology committees, chaired by the former Conservative cabinet ministers Greg Clark and Jeremy Hunt.  Striking what appeared to be a deliberately humble tone, Cummings began his evidence by claiming that he and other advisers and ministers had failed to grasp the seriousness of the situation in January and well into February. ""The truth is that senior ministers, officials, advisers like me, fell disastrously short of the standards the public has a right to expect of its government in a crisis like this,"" Cummings told Clark, the committee's chair. ""When the public needed us most, we failed. And I'd like to say to all the families of those who have died unnecessarily, how sorry I am for the mistakes that were made, and my own mistakes."" Cummings' evidence on Wednesday was being closely watched across Westminster, after a string of highly critical tweets in recent days in which he has criticised the decisions made by his former boss, and the preparedness of Whitehall for a crisis. He claimed he had realised the potential seriousness of the situation in Wuhan, China in January, and read out texts he sent to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, on 25 Janurary, asking about the government's pandemic preparedness. He said Hancock reassured him the government had a regularlyupdated pandemic plan ready – and that other institutions, including Public Health England and the World Health Organization, had at that time been reassuring. But he conceded he had then not pressed the issue – and said Johnson had continued not to realise the scale of the problem. ""In February, the prime minister regarded this as just a scare story,"" he said, suggesting Johnson had compared it to swine flu. Cummings made the extraordinary claim that he and other officials deliberately kept the prime minister away from meetings of the government's emergency Cobra meetings during the early days of the crisis, because they thought Johnson would make light of the virus. ""Certainly, the view of various officials inside No 10 was if we have the PM chair Cobra meetings, and he just tells everyone 'don't worry about it, I'm going to get [England's chief medical officer] Chris Whitty to inject me live on TV with coronavirus, so everyone realises it's nothing to be frightened of', that would not help, actually, serious planning."" He said much of Downing Street's attention in the early part of February was focused on other issues, including carrying out a cabinet reshuffle, and that in mid-February several key figures were ""literally skiing"". He added: ""We didn't figure this out until the back end of February."" Cummings described it as ""sort of tragic"" that someone who had spent as much time as he had urging people to avoid groupthink, that he had not sounded the alarm more loudly. Clark pressed Cummings about why he had not attended meetings of the key decision-making and advisory committees, Cobra and Sage, during the early days of the pandemic. Cummings said he had sent colleagues, including his ally Ben Warner, to some meetings and claimed it was not helpful for him to attend all Sage meetings because they involved technical briefings.",Real Guardian,564.0
683,Real,The Guardian,"Dominic Cummings ramped up his attacks on Boris Johnson on the eve of the former aide's evidence session, accusing the prime minister of having no ""serious plan"" to protect society's most vulnerable people from Covid. Johnson – along with ministers, government scientific advisers and civil servants – is braced for a lambasting from the man who was his most senior adviser until November, when Cummings is questioned by MPs on Wednesday.  It has been reported Cummings will use his appearance before MPs to claim Johnson referred to coronavirus as ""kung-flu"", and was willing to be infected with the virus live on TV – a statement that was allegedly made before he contracted the disease. Downing Street did not deny the claim. A No 10 spokesperson said: ""We are entirely focused on recovering from the pandemic, moving through the roadmap and distributing vaccines while delivering on the public's priorities."" Cummings is expected to blame those around him for failings in the handling of the pandemic in February and March last year, and in September when Johnson rejected a ""circuit-breaker"" lockdown. ""Throughout this pandemic, the government's priority has been to save lives, protect the NHS and support people's jobs and livelihoods across the United Kingdom."" On Tuesday, Cummings added to a 63-tweet thread on Twitter, saying that those in care homes and other social care, and vulnerable people asked to shield, had been failed. ""One of the worst failings in Feb/March, less discussed than lockdown, was the almost total absence of a serious plan for shielding/social care,"" he claimed. ""As in general, there was widespread delusion we HAD a great plan. It turned out to barely exist."" He said a helpline number was left off letters to members of the public being asked to shield from the virus because the helpline had not yet been set up. Cummings is to allege that, when Johnson rejected the argument for a September lockdown, he claimed ""Covid is only killing 80-year-olds"", according to ITV's political editor Robert Peston. The former aide will also be questioned on allegations – denied by No 10 – that Johnson said he would rather ""let the bodies pile high in their thousands"" than impose another lockdown. The failure to properly protect care home residents, with many discharged from hospital back into care settings where the virus then spread, is regarded as a key mistake of the early days of the pandemic. This month the Guardian revealed that more people died with Covid in care homes in England and Wales in the second wave of the pandemic than in the first. In total, more than 40,000 had Covid mentioned on their death certificate since March 2020. Angela Rayner, Labour's deputy leader, said Johnson's comments about Covid ""only killing 80-year-olds"" was ""utterly disgraceful"". ""The prime minister has once again shown a shameful disregard for other people's lives."" Cummings will be questioned by the House of Commons science and technology committees for several hours as part of their inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic. He has also promised to hand over relevant documents. According to a statement from the committees, they plan to cover ""the government's preparedness; decision-making in the early months of the pandemic; the level of scientific evidence available to the government; its border policy; and the effectiveness of its public health messaging and communications"". Johnson loyalists on the panel may also seek to discredit the prime minister's former aide, whom friends say remains hurt by his abrupt departure from the centre of power and wants revenge on his former boss. Cummings has previously dubbed the government's border policy a ""joke"" and described the Department of Health as a ""smoking ruin"". Government insiders are infuriated by the drip, drip of accusations from the former adviser, whom many believe damaged the credibility of the government with his trip to Durham during lockdown – and who they point out was involved in making many of the decisions he is now criticising. Former Brexit secretary David Davis said Cummings may have correctly identified some of the government's failings – but there was little evidence he had tried to correct them when he was inside government. ""This is a man whose primary purpose in life is to rewrite history to make him look good, but that doesn't mean that everything he says is completely wrong,"" he said. Wednesday's session will be chaired by two Conservative former cabinet ministers, Jeremy Hunt and Greg Clark, chairs of the cross-party health and science select committees respectively. Over the weekend, Cummings argued that a fundamental problem with the government's approach to the early days of the pandemic was the pre-existing plan for tackling a flu-like virus, which pointed to the impossibility of stopping its spread. Instead, Cummings claims the central plan initially was to rely on building up herd immunity, as more people caught the disease – until modelling showed that would involve an unmanageable death toll and put impossible pressure on the NHS. Downing Street adamantly denies that herd immunity was ever the aim of government policy, though it was mooted by chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance.",Real Guardian,851.0
684,Real,The Guardian,"The Conservative MP Rob Roberts faces a six-week suspension from the House of Commons and has had the party whip stripped from him for breaching parliament's sexual harassment policy – but can continue to sit as an MP. A report published on Tuesday by parliament's independent expert panel (IEP), found Roberts made repeated and unwanted sexual advances towards a former member of staff, as well as inappropriate comments of a sexual nature.  The IEP judged that a six-week suspension was the appropriate sanction. This will only come into effect if MPs support it, by voting for a motion in the House of Commons. Roberts, who has held the seat for Delyn in north Wales since 2019, apologised and said the ""breach of trust"" was ""completely improper and should not have happened"". Sir Stephen Irwin, the chair of the IEP, has said: ""The misconduct demonstrated here was significant. It is evident that Mr Roberts MP was in a very powerful position as an employer … Our conclusion is that the determination of six weeks suspension from the service of the House was proper and proportionate."" The former staff member claimed in an interview with BBC Wales that Roberts repeatedly propositioned him and asked him to ""be less alluring"", saying the MP's behaviour had left him ""uncomfortable"", ""shocked"" and ""horrified"". The complainant started working for the newly elected Roberts in early 2020, and claimed the MP made his ""first advance"" 10 days later. The staffer, who wishes to remain anonymous, told BBC Wales they were alone in a car together on a constituency visit when Roberts allegedly said: ""I find you very attractive and alluring and I need you to make attempts to be less alluring in the office because it's becoming very difficult for me."" Suspension from parliament for 10 days or more would usually trigger a recall petition, allowing a byelection to be triggered if 10% of the MP's constituents sign a petition. But because Roberts appealed a finding against him by the parliamentary commissioner for standards, causing his case to be referred to the IEP, the formal process under the Recall of MPs Act of 2015 will not be triggered. Irwin explained: ""For a recall to be initiated, the sanction must be imposed on the recommendation of the committee on standards, or another committee of the House of Commons concerned with standards of conduct. The independent expert panel is not a committee of the House of Commons."" The report found that Roberts had accepted that ""aspects of his behaviour"" towards the male staff member were ""inappropriate,"" and had offered to apologise – but ""rejected the categorisation of his conduct as 'sexual', preferring the term 'romantic'"". Subsequent attempts to persuade the staff member to go for a drink with him, ""amounted to no more than an attempt to reset their professional working relationship"", the MP claimed. Labour said the findings were serious enough to mean that Roberts should step down. The party chair, Anneliese Dodds, said: ""The report fully upholds the sexual harassment allegations made against Rob Roberts MP. He should therefore resign his seat with immediate effect. ""That such serious and proven abuse doesn't automatically result in the recall of a sitting member of parliament is both absurd and unjust. The Conservative government cannot dance around gaps in legislation if it is serious about upholding standards in public life."" Chris Bryant, the chair of parliament's standards committee, said: ""We must close this loophole immediately, and the only people who can do that are the government, by tabling legislation."" A Conservative party investigation into the case resulted in Roberts being ""rebuked"" for his behaviour, but Boris Johnson did not remove the whip from him at the time. A party spokesperson said: ""We would like to apologise to the individual concerned for the inappropriate and unwarranted treatment they were subjected to by someone in a position of authority. ""There is no place for the behaviour they were subjected to and we praise their courage in coming forward. ""In light of the outcome of the standards investigation, Rob Roberts MP has had the Conservative party whip suspended.""",Real Guardian,686.0
685,Real,The Guardian,"It promises to be the parliamentary event of the year so far – and may yet determine the fate of the prime minister. On Wednesday next week, Dominic Cummings will give evidence to MPs about Boris Johnson's role in making key decisions that critics say may have cost many thousands of lives.  Hurt by the manner of his departure from No 10, alongside Johnson's longtime aide Lee Cain, and by the briefing war that then ensued, Cummings seems intent on doing maximum damage to his former boss. ""He doesn't like the way he left: he thinks he should still be there,"" said one senior Tory who knows Cummings well. Asked about Cummings' intentions, he added: ""I think he wants to get Boris out."" So febrile is the mood at Westminster about the eagerly anticipated hearing that Downing Street was forced to deny on Friday that Johnson is planning a reshuffle on Wednesday, solely to draw attention away from his former aide. ""We are not doing a reshuffle,"" insisted a No 10 source. One cabinet minister fretted that Cummings could use the cloak of parliamentary privilege to disclose confidential information about key discussions last year – including potentially handing over documents, something Cummings has suggested he is prepared to do. The timing of the decisions to implement the lockdown in March 2020 and again in October – weeks after it was recommended by the Sage committee – are likely to come under close scrutiny. In a recent tweet highlighting the health impact of Covid, Cummings wrote: ""Many thousands will have serious health problems for years because of our failure to act faster/harder in Feb/March & Sep"". The government's border policies throughout the pandemic are also likely to be examined: Cummings recently described them as a ""joke"". Border restrictions remain contentious, with MPs questioning why Johnson waited until 23 April to put India on the red list – a decision that appears to have been a factor in allowing the variant first identified in India, B.1.617.2, to take hold. Whether Cummings' revelations will actually damage Johnson remains to be seen, however. The former adviser's standing with MPs has never been high. They remember in the heat of the Brexit parliamentary battle, he was reported to have yelled at Clark, one of the inquiry's co-chairs: ""When are you fucking MPs going to realise we are leaving on October 31? We are going to purge you."" Loyalty to his erstwhile bosses has never been a strong point for Cummings, either. After leaving the staff of the then Tory leader, Iain Duncan Smith, in 2003, he wrote a Telegraph article claiming: ""Mr Duncan Smith is incompetent, would be a worse prime minister than Tony Blair, and must be replaced."" Moreover, few colleagues believed his account of his comings and goings to Durham, and his outing to Barnard Castle to ""test his eyesight"", even before their postbags overflowed with furious constituents expressing their disbelief and fury. Those who worked in government with Cummings during the frantic early days of the pandemic say they don't remember him being as enthusiastic an advocate of lockdown as he now appears with the benefit of his own hindsight. One former colleague recalled watching his last select committee appearance and thinking: ""This guy seems to have some good ideas: if only he had had them while he was in government!"" However, they do remember him returning from his jaunt to Durham having – ironically – been won over to the idea that strict lockdowns and tougher border restrictions were the best approach to containing the virus from both a health and economic perspective. That set up a clash in September, when Johnson and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, were sceptical about the need for a fresh ""circuit-breaker"" lockdown: something the prime minister eventually reluctantly implemented on 31 October. Cummings is expected to spill the beans on Johnson's reluctance. Downing Street is keen for all these questions to be set aside for now. The prime minister recently announced that a public inquiry would examine the government's handling of the pandemic, but it will not begin its work until spring next year and is unlikely to report before the next general election. But the joint inquiry by the cross-party health and science select committees, chaired by the former Tory cabinet ministers Jeremy Hunt and Greg Clark, is working to a much tighter timescale. In Cummings' latest Twitter posts – delivered, he said, while awaiting his vaccination – he rubbished the idea of a public inquiry. ""The point of the inquiry is the opposite of learning, it is to delay scrutiny, preserve the broken system & distract public from real questions, leaving the parties & senior civil service essentially untouched,"" he said. Instead, he wants lessons to be learned now – including, perhaps, about his former boss's personal failings. And with most of the key players still in post and bound by collective responsibility, testimony from someone who was on the inside when many of the critical decisions were made is bound to be revelatory.",Real Guardian,840.0
686,Real,The Guardian,"Downing Street has played down reports of a cabinet rift over the UK's future trading relationship with Australia, as trade secretary Liz Truss pushes to secure a deal before the G7 summit next month. Truss is keen to throw open the UK market to Australian farmers, by slashing import tariffs on goods such as beef, lamb and sugar; while some of her cabinet colleagues, including Michael Gove, are anxious about the potential impact on British farmers.  Boris Johnson had been expected to arbitrate between the two sides at a cabinet committee meeting on Thursday. Number 10 played down the significance of the meeting, insisting it was a routine update. ""There are a regular series of meetings on not just this trade deal but the deals we have been working on throughout,"" Johnson's official spokesman said. But in what appeared to be a hint that Johnson had swung behind Truss, Downing Street said the prime minister was keen to ""maximise the massive opportunities presented by post-Brexit trade deals"". Discussions are likely to continue in the coming days. Mujtaba Rahman, of political consultancy Eurasia Group, said, ""I think Johnson instinctively and substantively is aligned with Truss, because I think he wants to champion the benefits of Brexit at every possible moment."" He added that a liberal deal on agriculture would also signal to the EU that the UK is resolute in its determination to avoiding aligning with EU food rules, despite the challenges created by the Northern Ireland protocol. The tussle underlines the competing interests the government will have to juggle, as it negotiates new post-Brexit trading relationships. National Farmers' Union (NFU) president Minette Batters has warned there is a risk of ""irreversible damage"" to the farming sector. Any changes could be phased in over a decade or more, however, to limit the disruption to farmers. Truss sees a free trade agreement with Australia as the first step towards securing UK entry to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), a trade pact between 11 countries, including Japan, Canada and Mexico. ""We're seeing 66% of the world's middle classes are going to be in Asia by 2030, growing demand for products like beef and lamb. So both Australian access and CPTTP access I think is positive for British farming,"" Truss told MPs this week. The Australian agreement could also form the template for future negotiations on an agreement with the much larger economy of the United States, which would be likely to press for similarly generous access to the UK's agriculture markets. Truss told MPs on Wednesday the deal would be good news for farmers. ""I've been very clear with them [farmers] that of course I'm always looking to make sure, as I have committed to, that British farmers will not be undercut by unfair practices from elsewhere. We will make sure in all the deals we do that British farming thrives and I'm absolutely confident that will be achieved through the Australia deal."" Australia's trade minister Dan Tehan has singled out agriculture as one area where Canberra would like to see the UK dismantle barriers to trade. In a Telegraph article last month he pointed to tariffs and quotas on imports of Australian beef and lamb to the UK, saying, ""British consumers are missing out on choosing high quality, well-priced Australian products. What's more, you're missing out on eating the best lamb chops and porterhouse steak in the world."" Tehan also highlighted Australia's desire to make it easier for services professionals to operate across the two countries, and for young Australians to come and work in the UK. Truss's Department for International Trade has estimated that exports from the UK to Australia could increase by £900m as a result of a free trade deal. Exports to the EU were £11.6bn in February alone. The international trade secretary, a committed free trader, is the most popular senior minister among Conservative members, according to the most recent poll by the Tory website Conservative Home. Boris Johnson came nineteenth, just above his chief whip, Mark Spencer. Truss caused controversy last year by inviting the former Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, as a trade adviser, despite his record as a climate change sceptic.",Real Guardian,701.0
687,Real,The Guardian,"Keir Starmer has appointed well-respected north-east of England MP Sharon Hodgson as his new parliamentary aide, as he seeks to smooth relations with Labour backbenchers after last weekend's fraught reshuffle. Hodgson, the MP for Washington and Sunderland West since 2010, replaces Carolyn Harris, who resigned earlier this week amid claims that she had stoked up tensions between Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner.  As Starmer's parliamentary private secretary, her job will be to liaise between backbenchers and the leader's office. Some MPs have complained in recent weeks that they felt neglected by Starmer's team. Hodgson will also bring understanding of the north-east, where Labour lost the Hartlepool byelection last week, and the Conservatives made fresh inroads in local council elections. Labour announced several other junior appointments on Friday evening, as the Labour leader completed the shakeup that began in the wake of last week's election results. Peter Kyle, the Hove MP, will be the shadow schools minister, after Wes Streeting was handed a new role overseeing Labour's child poverty strategy. Streeting announced on Friday that he will step back from frontline politics for the time being after being diagnosed with kidney cancer. The leftwinger Andy McDonald will have a beefed-up role in Rayner's new team, as shadow secretary of state for employment rights and protections. Seema Malhotra will be shadow business and consumer minister, replacing Lucy Powell, who was promoted last week to be shadow housing secretary. Other changes include a return to the fold for several MPs who had resigned for various reasons. Flo Eshalomi, MP for Vauxhall, who resigned rather than vote for Boris Johnson's Brexit in December, returns as Rayner's new parliamentary private secretary. Olivia Blake, the MP for Sheffield Hallam, who stepped down over Labour's stance on the overseas operations bill, returns as shadow minister for nature. Starmer's plans for overhauling his frontbench last weekend were held up for much of last Sunday by negotiations with Rayner about what role she would be willing to accept. She relinquished the jobs of party chair and national campaign coordinator, and was instead handed the role of shadowing the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, as well as other titles, including shadow secretary of state for the future of work.",Real Guardian,371.0
688,Real,The Guardian,"When Boris Johnson let slip to the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, on Tuesday that he would kick-off a Covid inquiry in the current session of parliament, it initially appeared to be an off-the-cuff remark. But as he prepared to give MPs a ""Covid update"" on Wednesday, it became clear No 10 has made the calculation that now was the right moment to announce an inquiry – though not yet to allow it to start work.  Johnson's team will hope that having a firm date in place, instead of his repeated promises of an inquiry ""when the time is right"", will help to neutralise – or postpone – some of the toughest questions about the pandemic, at least for now. But they will also have their eyes on a much larger prize: the next general election. In the short-term, the prime minister's management of the crisis is set to come under fierce scrutiny at Westminster. Later this month, Johnson's erstwhile right-hand man Dominic Cummings is due to give evidence at a potentially explosive select committee hearing. Cummings has made clear he intends to draw attention to what he regards as the failings of the government's response to the Covid pandemic – including the fateful decision to reject scientists' advice, and refuse to call a lockdown last September. His evidence – coming from one of the few people who was in the room for key decisions and is no longer bound by collective responsibility – is being hotly anticipated at Westminster. Expectations were only heightened when Johnson went to war with his ex-aide, with the prime minister reportedly briefing newspaper editors personally that Cummings had been responsible for a series of embarrassing leaks. After Wednesday's announcement of a public inquiry, however, Downing Street will now have a reassuringly bland answer to whatever accusations Cummings throws at it. It can insist all such matters – did Johnson fail to grasp the scale of the crisis? Was the Department of Health a ""smoking ruin,"" as Cummings has previously claimed? – will be examined sombrely, from all sides, at the public inquiry to come. As to the question of why the inquiry's work cannot begin sooner, as bereaved families and opposition parties have demanded, Johnson claimed the key protagonists remain too busy. Speaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday, he stressed the significant burden an inquiry would place on the NHS and government, and insisted it should wait until the ""heat"" of the pandemic is over. ""We must not inadvertently divert and distract the very people on whom we all depend,"" he said, stressing the risks of new Covid variants, and of a potential third wave in the winter ahead. Johnson said he wanted to see findings published within a ""reasonable timescale"". According to thinktank the Institute for Government, most public inquiries take ""around two years"" to report back, with the duration of the 69 that were launched between 1990 and 2017 varying between 45 days, and 13 years and three months. The precise terms of reference of the inquiry will be set by the government, which will also name a chair. But given the complexity of the questions involved, and the breadth of personnel likely to be called – scientists, civil servants, ministers, many with their own legal representation – a fast turnaround appears unlikely. Long before it reports, the inquiry may nevertheless reveal evidence and documents that help to shed light on how critical decisions were made in the dark days of 2020, and the roles of Johnson, Chris Whitty, Patrick Vallance and other key figures. But with received wisdom at Westminster pointing to a 2023 general election, the delay until next spring all but guarantees that few conclusions will yet have been reached, when the UK next goes to the polls to elect a government.",Real Guardian,636.0
689,Real,The Guardian,"A cross-party coalition of senior MPs including Labour's Stella Creasy and the Conservative David Davis will try to use the Queen's speech debate to force the government to comply with legal judgments that found it in breach of human rights. They are highlighting two issues: unmarried parents who are not entitled to bereavement benefits; and victims of domestic violence who have a special ""sanctuary room"" to flee into in case of danger and have been made liable to pay the bedroom tax as a result.  The government was found to be in breach of the European convention on human rights for failing to pay bereavement support to unmarried parents by the supreme court in 2018, and again by the high court in February 2020, after the benefit had been renamed. Similarly, the European court of human rights ruled in October 2019 that applying the bedroom tax to ""Sanctuary Scheme"" homes – those that are specially adapted to enable at-risk women and children to live safely at home – amounted to unlawful discrimination. Neither issue has since been rectified by the government. The MPs hope to amend the motion approving the Queen's speech – usually a formality – until the government commits to resolving them both. The group, who have written to all their colleagues asking for support, represent nine political parties. They include Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey, Green MP Caroline Lucas and Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville Roberts. ""We ask for your support for our amendment to the Queen's speech to urge the government to make it a priority to remedy these situations and so end the destitution victims of domestic violence and orphaned children face as a result,"" they say in the letter. ""This would send a strong message that parliament is committed to ensuring and supporting prompt action in support of protecting the rights of the people and in upholding the rule of law as a result."" They point out that the issue of bereavement payments affects 2,000 families a year, where a parent dies without being married to, or in a civil partnership with, their partner. ""Parents make the same national insurance contributions whether they're married or not, and this builds up their entitlement to certain benefits including bereavement support payment – worth almost £10,000 over 18 months to grieving families. It should be understood that the primary victims of this inaction are the children rather than the parents,"" the MPs say. Creasy has a history of rallying cross-party support to force concessions from the Conservatives, including over abortion rights in Northern Ireland, after an amendment to the 2017 Queen's speech looked likely to succeed. MPs are due to continue debating the Queen's speech until next Wednesday. The Speaker decides which amendments are selected; but he is more likely to pick those with broad cross-party support. He can choose up to four. A Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson said it was ""carefully considering the court's decision"" on the bedroom tax, adding that discretionary housing benefit was also available for those in most need. On payments to bereaved parents, the spokesperson said: ""We understand how vital this support is to families. As we have said, we will be taking forward the legislative process to extend Bereavement Support Payment and Widowed Parent's Allowance to unmarried couples with children, and we are carefully considering the detail and implementation which we will outline in due course.""",Real Guardian,569.0
690,Real,The Guardian,"Keir Starmer handed his biggest internal rival, Angela Rayner, a major promotion on Sunday night after a day of fraught negotiations, but sacked his shadow chancellor and promoted his close ally Rachel Reeves to the role, in a move set to further inflame tensions with the party's left. The reshuffle of Starmer's shadow cabinet was derailed by a prolonged standoff with Rayner who was locked in talks with Starmer's team for hours on Sunday after leaked plans to sack her as party chair and national campaigns coordinator triggered an outcry.  The Guardian understands Starmer had initially offered Rayner a front bench role covering the social care brief; but she regarded that as a significant demotion, and was determined to maintain influence over internal Labour politics and policy. Rayner emerged with a significantly beefed-up role, handed the shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster role shadowing Michael Gove, as well as a newly created post as shadow secretary for the future of work. She will also retain joint control over party matters as deputy leader. Rayner's move from party chair had been planned as the first in a wider reshuffle following a series of disappointing results in Thursday's elections. But the announcement of further changes was delayed throughout the day as Starmer's team tried to placate his livid deputy, who is widely seen as a potential future leadership challenger. Despite losing her role as party chair, allies of Rayner said she would retain significant ultimate control over party matters. Anneliese Dodds, the former shadow chancellor, will have joint control and chair Labour's policy review. ""Keir's office failed to articulate a vision or set out what Labour stands for, and then they tried to blame Angela for the local elections,"" one ally said. ""She's going to be much more visible taking the fight to the Tories on corruption, leading the fight on the future of our economy and jobs. Keir can't connect with people in the Red Wall seats like she does."" Party sources said there was barely concealed fury with Rayner that the row had dominated 24 hours of far more promising results for Labour, including in Wales and victories in the West of England, Cambridge and Peterborough and West Yorkshire mayoralties. ""We could have spent the last day celebrating the much better results for Labour in Wales and elsewhere if Angela's people hadn't decided to try and blow the party up over who runs what bits of Labour HQ,"" one source said. 'The obsession with internal power plays must end."" Starmer also sacked the chief whip Nick Brown, a veteran of both the Brown and Corbyn years. Both Dodds, who served in John McDonnell's shadow treasury team, and Brown were seen as key appointments from the soft left of the party and the promotion for Reeves, seen as Starmer's closest shadow cabinet ally, puts the party's centre in the ascendency. Few other changes have been made, despite briefings that Starmer wanted to sack shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy, a briefing his team expressly denied. Alan Campbell will replace Brown as chief whip and Thangam Debbonaire will become shadow leader of the House of Commons. Other promotions included Wes Streeting, another key figure from the party's centre, who moves to a new shadow cabinet brief for child poverty. Lucy Powell, a key figure from the Ed Miliband years, will be shadow housing secretary. Starmer said the party would refocus on bold ideas and the priorities of the British people. ""The Labour Party must be the party that embraces the demand for change across our country,"" he said. ""Just as the pandemic has changed what is possible and what is necessary, so Labour must change too."" The row between Labour's two most senior figures overshadowed more positive election results for the party over the weekend, including a resounding win in Wales. Elections expert Prof John Curtice put Labour's projected national share of the vote, calculated from local election results for the BBC, at 29%, seven points behind the Tories. That would be an improvement on the 12-point deficit at the 2019 general election but Curtice said it was ""looking very similar to many a lacklustre performance under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership"". Rayner has her own Labour power base because she was directly elected to the position of deputy leader, which she will keep in any event. Senior Labour sources were confirming on Saturday evening that she had been asked to relinquish her elections role, as the party shakes up its approach to campaigns in the light of losses in Thursday's Hartlepool byelection and on English councils. But by Sunday morning, after senior figures including Andy Burnham signalled their dissent, the message had changed and Starmer loyalist Ian Murray, the shadow Scottish secretary, was claiming Rayner had been offered a bigger role. ""Angela Rayner hasn't been sacked, as I understand it, Angela Rayner has been offered a significant promotion, to take her from the back office of the Labour party running elections, to the front office where she's talking to the country,"" he told Sophy Ridge on Sky News.

691,Real,The Guardian,"In the aftermath of Labour's crushing general election defeat in 2019, Keir Starmer's appeal to despondent party members and MPs was – as one said at the time – as a ""comfort blanket"". Decent, serious and unencumbered by baggage from Labour's factional forever-war, many hoped he would polish the party's image and build an election-winning machine, without ditching many of the policies of the Jeremy Corbyn years.  After a chaotic 48 hours of briefings and counter-briefings, sackings and silences, many senior party figures were asking themselves on Sunday whether their confidence had been misplaced. Starmer's team were acutely conscious in advance that early results from Thursday's bumper round of elections would be the toughest for them – kicking off with the Hartlepool byelection but including many challenging English councils too. But the scale of the defeat in Hartlepool still appears to have taken them by surprise. The Labour leader declined to answer questions as he left his north London home on Friday morning, having previously said he would ""carry the can"" for his party's performance. It was late afternoon before he emerged into the public eye. Giving a brief interview in a book-lined office, he conceded: ""Very often we've been talking to ourselves, instead of to the country, and we've lost the trust of working people, particularly in places like Hartlepool. I intend to do whatever is necessary to fix that."" By Saturday evening, the electoral picture looked very different, with Labour back in government in Wales and mayors Andy Burnham and Sadiq Khan both comfortably returned to power. But by that point the good news had been drowned out by a fresh bout of Labour infighting. News of an attempt to sideline Starmer's deputy, Angela Rayner – alongside apparently well-briefed reports that shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds and other senior figures including the chief whip Nick Brown could be ditched – sent shock waves through the party. Events on Saturday afternoon are disputed by both sides. Rayner's team say the first they heard of a plan to remove her from the posts of national campaign coordinator and party chair was when they were phoned by journalists asking for comment on her demotion. Starmer's aides insist they were not the source of briefings that she would be sacked, though senior party sources did not dispute on Saturday evening that she would lose both roles. Rayner and her backers reacted with fury, with one MP saying she had been ""stabbed in the front"" in a move that ""beggars belief"". Some suspected Lord Mandelson, the former cabinet minister who is known to discuss strategy with Starmer's team, of being involved in the briefing. The Labour peer, who has given a series of interviews defending Starmer, dismissed that idea. Other MPs pointed the finger at senior Starmer aides, whom some shadow ministers have long complained can be high-handed with frontbenchers. Whatever the truth, what appears to have been an attempt to stamp Starmer's authority on the party and shift the headlines away from Labour's challenges in the red wall seemed to have precisely the opposite effect. Burnham, fresh from celebrating his own electoral success, tweeted: ""I can't support this."" Others are known to have made their views clear to Starmer in private as the evening went on. One source told the Guardian the Labour leader was warned by senior party figures that he could lose his majority on the party's ruling national executive committee if he dumped Rayner. By Sunday morning, the message from Labour HQ had changed dramatically, and the shadow Scotland secretary, Ian Murray, was sent out to tell Sky News that Rayner had in fact been offered a promotion. But hours later, no details of this new role – or of the expected wider reshuffle – had been announced, and there was radio silence from Starmer's office. Rayner's supporters said she was still locked in negotiations with Starmer, with the knock-on effect of delaying the other changes to his top team. Meanwhile, anxiety inside the party was shifting from the election results themselves to the handling of the aftermath by Starmer and the wider leader's office. ""If they ever had the plot, they've completely lost it now,"" said one frontbencher. Some frontbenchers felt frustrated and let down by the hostile briefings about colleagues, including the well-liked and amenable Dodds. ""At 7am yesterday, I would have said the chances of a leadership challenge were about 0% or as close to that as you could get,"" said one exasperated Labour staffer. ""By 7pm they were getting dangerously close to 100%."" ""It's like they didn't learn the lessons of what happened with Watson,"" he said, referring to the attempt by Corbyn's aides in 2019 to have the post of deputy leader abolished, which was withdrawn after a backlash, leaving the mischievous Watson politically rejuvenated. There were hopes last night that Starmer would smooth things over with his deputy, polish off the reshuffle and get back on the front foot in time for a big week in the Commons, with the Queen's speech on Tuesday due to set out the government's plans for the coming months. But few in the parliamentary Labour party believe he emerges from the past 48 hours with his authority enhanced.",Real Guardian,870.0

Starmer has also appointed Deborah Mattinson, a veteran pollster and former adviser to Gordon Brown, as Labour's new head of strategy.

Rayner's status as deputy Labour leader is safe as that is a directly-elected post. But the move has reignited Labour's civil war, as MPs and activists reacted with shock and dismay. Gaya Sriskanthan, Momentum co-chair, called the move ""blatant scapegoating"", saying of Starmer: ""It is his failed strategy that has brought us to this point, and he said he would take responsibility. Yet again he has gone back on his word.""

Rayner and Starmer carried out a string of visits together in the closing days of the local elections campaign but her allies complained she was given little leeway over campaign messaging or candidate selection in Hartlepool. One senior Labour aide said: ""There's a lot of pressure to sack her from MPs and from staff,"" though MPs contacted by the Guardian on Friday singled out other key figures for blame, including Starmer's chief of staff, Jenny Chapman. Rayner, the MP for Ashton-under-Lyne, was shadow education secretary under Jeremy Corbyn, and was widely seen as a potential leadership candidate, but stepped aside to let her close friend Rebecca Long-Bailey run. Some Labour sources suggested the move was part of a wider reshuffle, which could see other senior figures including the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, removed from their posts. Labour's Norwich South MP Clive Lewis said: ""The fear is, the leader's office is now in headless chicken mode and looking into the void. We needed calm and considered and we got this. It really does look like they will thrash about like Alan Partridge pitching anything for a second season."" One Labour MP who backed Starmer for leadership said the decision was ""gobsmacking"" and said it would erode trust that Starmer could respond rationally to the election fallout. ""You don't say, 'I take full responsibility' and then sack your deputy [as party chair]."" Another Labour MP said they saw the move as a way to pin blame on an internal rival rather than a loyalist such as Steve Reed or Jim Macmahon but said female MPs would ""go batshit"". Rayner was given little input in strategy decisions, MPs said. ""This is the wrong fight to have,"" said one. One Northern MP said Rayner did bear some responsibility. ""If she's chair of the party and head of campaigns then she needs to take some of the responsibility. If Keir is serious about reform he needs to put some one in that role who knows what they are doing."" A Labour source said: ""Keir said he was taking full responsibility for the result of the elections – and he said we need to change. That means change how we run our campaigns in the future. Angela will continue to play a senior role in Keir's team."" It was unclear what alternative role would be offered, or whether she would accept it.",Real Guardian,566.0
694,Real,The Guardian,"Keir Starmer is expected to reshuffle his top team and kick off a policy review as he seeks to reassert his leadership after a string of embarrassing losses in the ""Super Thursday"" elections. Recriminations flew on Friday as the scale of the Hartlepool defeat sank in, and the Tories gained control of councils from Harlow to Northumberland.  One shadow cabinet member said the Hartlepool byelection result had sparked ""full-on panic"" among Labour MPs fearful that their seats could be vulnerable at the next general election. ""It's the fact that 2019 was not the floor: that's pretty scary,"" they added. Another described Starmer's aides as ""ashen"" at the scale of the swing against Labour in the north-east England town. Starmer made no public statement until late afternoon, more than nine hours after the Hartlepool result was announced, when he allowed broadcasters a brief interview. ""He's in his north London bunker, holed up with his advisers,"" said one party source. A shadow cabinet member said: ""I would like to talk to him, and tell him to hold his nerve."" A senior party source declined to say whether Starmer would shake up his frontbench but repeatedly underlined the need for the party to show it had changed. ""We have got to change, and that has got to be much harder and faster than we anticipated six months ago,"" they said, adding: ""We have got to look at the policy platform across the board, post-pandemic."" Another senior party adviser said: ""I think a reshuffle is quite imminent. They want people who are recognisable."" Starmer is expected to focus on bringing in media-savvy big beasts from Labour's backbenches. Names frequently touted include former cabinet ministers Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn. Rachel Reeves could also be set for a more senior role. Reeves is trusted by Starmer and has worked closely with him on Brexit policy, but could be given a big Whitehall department to shadow. Meanwhile the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, and the shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, have sometimes been criticised for failing to make an impact. One source suggested the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, could also be vulnerable. A shadow minister loyal to Starmer said: ""Keir hasn't been able to do anything because of the pandemic – make proper speeches, talk to voters. The same is also true for the shadow cabinet, so to an extent some of the criticism of them is unfair as well. But I think people feel it's time to bring back some of the genuine big hitters, people like Hilary [Benn] and Yvette [Cooper]."" That would be likely to spark accusations of a shift towards the right, however, and others including the Brighton MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle called for Starmer to allow leftwingers a seat at the ""top table"" in an approach he compared to that of the US president, Joe Biden. Some Starmer loyalists sought to blame his deputy, Angela Rayner, who is Labour's national campaign coordinator, for the party's poor electoral performance. But Rayner's allies said she was overruled on messaging, with Starmer's team keeping tight control over the campaign. Rayner had hoped to focus more on boosting sick pay, and ""jobs, jobs, jobs"". Starmer's chief of staff, Lady Jenny Chapman, was another key figure mentioned by disgruntled Labour MPs as partly responsible for the humiliating scale of the loss in Hartlepool, including by masterminding the selection of the candidate, Paul Williams, a remain-supporting former MP who was chosen from a one-man ""shortlist"". Chapman lost her Darlington seat in 2019, and has encouraged Starmer to focus on winning back voters in areas like hers. Starmer's focus on ""Tory sleaze"" in recent days has also been questioned by some in the parliamentary Labour party, who said it failed to resonate with voters. His team insist they have also highlighted other issues, including jobs and crime.",Real Guardian,639.0
695,Real,The Guardian,"Jill Mortimer, the brand new Tory MP for Hartlepool, explaining her historic byelection victory on Friday morning, said the town's voters knew ""Labour MPs had not been doing their best for them"". But as the soul-searching began in Keir Starmer's party, Labour strategists are not just asking themselves what Labour has done to neglect its former heartlands, but what Boris Johnson's Conservatives have done right.  There are many factors, but one is clearly the prime minister himself. A Labour MP who has spent a lot of time canvassing voters in Hartlepool over the past few weeks said: ""They like Johnson as a person. They see him as being optimistic."" When the prime minister visited recently, he talked of the ""massive opportunities"" for the local area, and posed for selfies with schoolchildren. A senior Conservative who has worked on campaigns with the prime minister said: ""Boris is a good salesman. I don't think anyone can doubt he's an incredible campaigner, probably unrivalled in British politics."" While Starmer has been harrying Johnson in Westminster over the questions about funding for his flat refurbishment, which has prompted several official inquiries, perceptions of ""sleaze"" do not yet appear to have dented his appeal. Another Labour insider points out that, while Brexit may no longer be the first issue on voters' minds in doorstep conversations, Johnson did what he had pledged, and pressed ahead with leaving the European Union in the face of furious opposition from many in Westminster (not least Starmer himself). That has helped the Tories to present the prime minister as an insurgent figure, offering a fresh start, despite the party having been in power for more than a decade. And the vaccine rollout – faster in the UK than in the EU, at least initially – may for some voters have vindicated the decision to back Johnson to ""get Brexit done"". Johnson's former chief of staff Dominic Cummings argued on Twitter on Friday that the Tories had also continued to be aided by the dramatic political realignment brought about by the Vote Leave campaign – in the face of scepticism from commentators. ""When pundits who 'explained' why Vote Leave's plan to realign politics was mad/stupid/impossible now give post hoc 'explanations' for why it's all so logical/inevitable … ignore their babble … Pundits = noise not signal,"" Cummings tweeted. Another senior Vote Leave figure explained that the 2016 campaign married a leftwing pro-public spending message – memorably calling for an extra £350m a week to be spent on the NHS – with rightwing positions on other issues. ""That campaign managed to push forward the more traditional issues of crime and immigration, where a lot of the country are rightwing, and public services, where a lot of the country are leftwing and want more investment. So that big realignment was there, and Boris took that on: and that is what Boris has moved forward with as an agenda."" Even before the pandemic, the government's plans for significant investment in infrastructure, focused heavily on the areas where it hopes to hold on to its electoral gains, made it difficult for Labour to caricature Johnson as pro-austerity – despite continuing deep cuts in some areas, such as local authority funding. And since Covid-19 struck, the chancellor's unprecedented furlough scheme has meant a Conservative government directly paying the wages of millions of workers using taxpayers' money – hardly Thatcherite laissez-faire. The former Labour adviser James Meadway has called the Johnson government's approach ""Houchenism"", after the Conservative Ben Houchen, who unexpectedly won the Teesside mayoralty in 2017 and has consolidated the party's hold in the region with promises of jobs and investment. One seasoned Labour campaigner lamented: ""Build a new corner-shop on Teesside and Houchen turns up in hi-vis and a safety helmet and claims the credit."" Another, who has been pounding the streets of Hartlepool, said: ""Voters want a bit of that largesse."" Promising a new freeport in Teesside, as well as a Treasury outpost in Darlington, has helped add to the sense that the government is optimistic about the economic future of the north-east of England – as well as its own capacity to hold on to the electoral gains it made in the region in 2019. Houchen set out his approach in a recent piece for the ConservativeHome website, combining calls for more investment in green technologies with a culture war dig against climate protesters. ""Many of the people I represent have little time for the hug-a-husky politics of the pre-Johnson era, or the increasingly bizarre publicity stunts of extremists like Extinction Rebellion,"" he said. ""They're just as into clean air and against pollution as anyone, but the real draw of a Green Industrial Revolution is that it will mean more good jobs, both skilled and professional. Good jobs close to home too, not roles necessitating long commutes and weeks on end away from family."" Even Johnson's warmest supporters point out that if they want to win the next general election, the Tories will need to deliver on these promises of better infrastructure and more jobs, allowing voters to realise the ""massive opportunities"" Johnson is pointing to.",Real Guardian,853.0
696,Real,The Guardian,"Voters are going to the polls for what has been dubbed Super Thursday, with ballots being cast across England, Scotland and Wales in the largest test of political opinion outside of a general election. In England, as well as local council and mayoral contests, the Hartlepool parliamentary byelection is being watched as a battleground that Labour is desperate to retain. Hartlepool was held by Labour with a majority of 3,595 in 2019 even as other bricks in the so-called ""red wall"" crumbled – in part due to the Brexit party splitting the Tory vote.  Voting ends at 10pm, with some key results expected overnight including Hartlepool, though much of the counting is due to stretch through the weekend and into Monday. Keir Starmer is braced for a challenging 48 hours ahead , as his critics prepare to seize on weaknesses in Labour's performance to demand a fresh approach. After a leaked poll showed the party on course to lose badly in the Hartlepool byelection, the Labour leader said he would take responsibility if the results of Thursday's polls were disappointing. ""When things go right, the leader takes the plaudits; when they don't go right, the leader carries the can and takes responsibility,"" he said on the campaign trail in Birmingham. ""That's what I will do with these elections, as I will do in everything that the Labour party does. ""I'm conscious, the whole party is conscious, that this is but a step on the road to the next general election."" Crisscrossing England on the final day of campaigning, Starmer also visited a food bank in Pontefract with Labour's West Yorkshire mayoral candidate, Tracy Brabin. Thousands of council seats across England will be contested on Thursday, as well as every seat in the Scottish parliament and Welsh Senedd, and English mayoralties including in the West Midlands, Teesside and London. Starmer's team are acutely aware that Hartlepool's will be one of the few results announced by Friday morning, with ballots in most local council and mayoral elections not being counted overnight. With some critical MPs preparing to break cover and question the leadership's approach to winning back voters in Labour's former heartlands, that could allow a downbeat narrative to take hold before results have been announced for areas where Starmer's team hopes to do better. The Guardian revealed on Tuesday that Labour's canvassing in Hartlepool suggested only 40% of the party's previous supporters had pledged to vote for its candidate, Paul Williams. Boris Johnson played down the Tories' prospects of stealing the seat on Wednesday, insisting his party were ""fighting for every vote"". Campaigning in the West Midlands, where Conservative Andy Street is expected to retain the mayoralty, the prime minister said: ""I think Andy Street has done an outstanding job in the West Midlands, I think Ben Houchen is a fantastic mayor in Teesside and obviously we are fighting for every vote in Hartlepool. ""But these are tough contests and Hartlepool in particular you'd have to say, that hasn't been a Conservative since its inception – 46 years ago or whatever it was. So I think that will be a very tough fight but I hope everybody gets out to vote."" During the campaign, the Tories have highlighted investment in local infrastructure and national spending pledges, including plans to hire 20,000 new nurses. Labour MPs across England contacted by the Guardian about the mood on the doorstep warned of ""apathy"" among voters. Some complained about Labour's lack of concrete proposals to sell to a sceptical electorate. ""There is zero policy,"" said one frontbencher. ""People don't really know what we stand for, so we're having to fall back on the time-honoured tradition of anti-Tory sentiment,"" complained another MP. ""The focus of getting people to vote Labour who did previously and don't any more is the right one – but it's the way they've done it,"" said a leftwing backbencher. ""They've approached it in a way which is a caricature of northern, working-class people: beer, fish and chips and flags."" Several warned that the Green party were eating into Labour's support in some areas, attracting voters who had previously warmed to Jeremy Corbyn, while Labour does not yet appear to be replacing them by winning over ex-Tory voters. ""We're getting eaten now at both ends of our support,"" said a former shadow cabinet minister. ""We need to redouble our efforts now to show people that we're in business."" Starmer's team said they had been hampered by the difficulty of on-the-ground campaigning and the struggle to get their message across during the pandemic. ""In some ways, these elections have come too soon for us,"" said a senior party strategist. They pointed to the long-term realignment that has seen Labour's vote share falling across a swath of seats in former industrial areas, as their demographics have changed over the past decade. But a poor performance is nevertheless likely to intensify recent calls for Starmer to reshuffle his shadow cabinet, some of whom have struggled to make a significant impact on the public consciousness. In Scotland, where the new Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, has only been in place for a few weeks, the party is nevertheless hoping to see what one insider called ""red shoots"" appearing.",Real Guardian,870.0
697,Real,The Guardian,"Labour strategists say their electoral chances this week have been hampered by two welcome, and successful, government policies: the furlough scheme, under which the state has paid millions of people's wages, and the successful delivery of the Covid vaccine. Keir Starmer's team point out that the feelgood factor from the vaccine rollout, and the relaxing of restrictions on voters' everyday lives, would be a challenging backdrop for any opposition party. And they insist his is a long-term project of restoring Labour to winning form by the time of the next general election.  Starmer himself has repeatedly said he and his colleagues have ""a mountain to climb"", and his allies are pinning their hopes for Thursday's elections on modest gains far away from the ""red wall"", in Scotland and the south of England. But if the party fares as badly this week as some polls have suggested – losing Hartlepool's seat at Westminster to the Conservatives and going backwards in areas Labour hopes to win in 2024 – Starmer could come under intense pressure from colleagues to change tack. In particular, while his allies are now highlighting potential gains for Labour in south and south-west England, Starmer's strategy in the 12 months since he took over has been aimed squarely at recapturing seats such as Darlington, which his chief of staff, Jenny Chapman, lost to the Conservatives in 2019. A poor performance in areas such as Doncaster, which may hint at further potential red wall gains for the Tories, and any signs that Labour continues to go backwards in areas such as the West Midlands where it lost nine Westminster seats in 2019, would spark alarm within the parliamentary party. That is highly unlikely to mean a leadership challenge, however. Disgruntled Corbynite MPs almost certainly couldn't muster the 40 MPs necessary to kick off a race (the leftwing Socialist Campaign Group has 34 members), while Labour's centrists have the humiliating memory of Owen Smith's vainglorious 2016 candidacy seared on their memories. But Starmer's critics on both wings of the party may well feel emboldened to push for a shadow cabinet shakeup – and perhaps a rejig of the leader's office, too. Some frontbenchers complain that Starmer's close-knit team are cautious and controlling, keeping the shadow cabinet on a short leash – perhaps partly as a reaction to the leaks and hostile briefing of the Jeremy Corbyn years. Starmer's team have repeatedly insisted there are ""no plans"" for a reshuffle, but they could decide to seize the moment for a fresh start. The Labour leader had already been planning to make more speeches and policy announcements in the coming months as the acute phase of the pandemic recedes. But he will face far more intense pressure to do so if Thursday's results are disappointing, and as Boris Johnson prepares to use the Queen's speech next week to ramp up his plans to ""build back better"". One seasoned Labour adviser suggested Starmer would be wise to ignore the knee-jerk reactions of colleagues from all sides of the party, and wait for the dust to settle, however. ""On Friday, you'll have people on the right saying: 'You haven't done enough to purge the Trots' and people on the left saying: 'Bring back Jeremy' – but we'll still be counting votes on Monday,"" they said.",Real Guardian,551.0
698,Real,The Guardian,"Care home residents in England will be allowed to receive two regular visitors from Monday 12 April, as Covid restrictions are eased further, Boris Johnson is to announce. Strict Department of Health guidance has severely curtailed the contact residents have had with their loved ones during the pandemic. Only one named visitor is currently permitted.  Under guidance to be published next week, two people will be allowed to visit regularly, as long as they have a negative Covid test result. They will have to wear protective equipment, but will be allowed to hold their loved one's hand. Babies and children under the age of two will be excluded from the limit, so that elderly residents can meet new grandchildren or great-grandchildren. The prime minister said: ""Reuniting family and friends has been a priority each time restrictions have eased, and the next step will be no different. ""I'm particularly pleased to allow residents to have more visitors, including grandchildren, given the isolation and concern felt by so many this past year."" Care homes were hit particularly hard during the first wave of the virus. A damning report from the cross-party public accounts committee of MPs in February highlighted dire shortages of PPE for care staff, and the fact that 25,000 people were discharged back into residential homes from hospitals in the first wave, some without being tested for the virus. The government is guaranteeing it will continue to provide free personal protective equipment to care homes until March next year. Almost 94% of care home residents have received at least the first dose of a vaccine, as have almost 78% of care staff. The government is considering plans to make the jab compulsory for staff, with an announcement expected in the coming days. Unions have warned against such a move, saying it could be discriminatory, urging employers to focus instead on encouraging their staff to be vaccinated. Fiona Carragher, the director of research and influencing at the Alzheimer's Society, welcomed the change in the visiting rules. ""Visits are vital to care home residents with dementia, who have been isolated from their loved ones, without the essential care and support their families so often provide, and as a result experienced a devastating increase in their dementia symptoms over the past year,"" she said. ""We've come a long way since the first lockdown, and soon we hope to see the benefits from people with dementia being reunited with their loved ones."" Liz Kendall MP, the shadow care minister, said: ""Families are absolutely crucial for the physical and mental health of care home residents, and as infection rates in care homes continue to fall it is important that residents are able to reunite with family members as soon as possible. ""However, this guidance will not be enough for those care home residents who are still unable to receive visits from their loved ones.

699,Real,The Guardian,"The Philippines, Pakistan, Kenya, and Bangladesh are to be added to England's ""red list"" of countries from which almost all travel is banned, ministers have announced. The additions, which come into effect next Friday, will take the number of red list countries to 39, as the government battles to prevent potentially vaccine-resistant variants of Covid-19 from coming to the UK.  British and Irish nationals and residents can return from red-list countries, but they must pay to enter compulsory hotel quarantine. The changes will come into effect at 4am on 9 April, according to a statement issued on Friday. ""The government has made it consistently clear it will take decisive action if necessary to contain the virus and has added these destinations to the red list to protect public health,"" the statement said. Ministers have rejected the idea of widening the list to include European countries such as France and Germany, where a third wave of Covid infections is causing growing concern about the potential for mutations. Boris Johnson told the liaison committee of senior MPs last week that placing France on the red list could not be ruled out, but underlined the close trading and other ties between the two countries that would make it difficult to implement. ""We are certainly looking at that but people should be under no illusions that it would have consequences,"" he said, stressing the high volume of cross-channel trade. Labour has called for a ""comprehensive"" hotel quarantine system, to prevent the arrival of further cases of Covid mutations, in particular the South African variant, which some studies have shown appears to have some resistance to vaccines. The prime minister is expected to set out further details on Monday of how decisions will be made about when foreign travel could resume more widely. A ""traffic light"" system is expected to be introduced in the summer that could allow at least some travel to countries with a successful vaccination programme and with few cases of ""variants of concern"".

But he went on to say that solving the climate crisis would be impossible without the cooperation of corporations. ""When I first came in as an MP I was like, I'm not taking meetings with any of these people, these people are the enemy, you know.

He said several of the companies he has dealt with over the years have ""seen the way the wind is blowing"" on climate, and ""the private sector is ahead of the UK government"". After the remarks were highlighted by the Sun newspaper, Sobel apologised to the Labour leader. Starmer was asked about Sobel's comments on a campaign visit to Hartlepool, where Labour faces a tough battle to retain the seat on May.

701,Real,The Guardian,"Tussles with the EU over vaccine supplies could continue for months, UK government insiders fear, despite a joint statement in which both sides committed to working together. From Boris Johnson's phone calls to EU leaders to the foreign secretary Dominic Raab's discreet lobbying on the fringes of this week's Nato meeting, a significant amount of senior government time and energy is being invested in trying to resolve the issue.  The public mood music is soothing – the joint statement issued on Wednesday pointed to the need for a ""win-win"" solution for both sides – but privately there is simmering fury. The government was particularly incensed by press reports that 30m doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in an Italian warehouse raided by police were earmarked for the UK. The company insisted they were destined for developing countries or the EU itself. One government source suggested there was a move to ""whip up an anti-AstraZeneca mob,"" treating the firm as a scapegoat for politicians' failings. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, made his frustration clear on Wednesday. Asked about comments from the EU internal markets commissioner, Thierry Breton, that the UK was engaging in ""vaccine nationalism,"" he told the Financial Times bluntly: ""Our contract trumps theirs. It's called contract law. It's very straightforward."" Johnson perhaps also let slip his true feelings when he told his MPs earlier in the week it was greed that had ensured the vaccine was developed and rolled out so rapidly in the UK. In public, however, the language from London has been largely diplomatic because of fears about the potential consequences if the EU decides to choke off supplies. In fact, neither side has received as many doses as they had initially hoped. AstraZeneca had suggested it could supply 30m to the UK by September 2020, for example, more than the entire number of Pfizer and AstraZeneca jabs so far administered to the public, six months later. The startling success of the UK's rollout means there have been few quibbles from the government, but EU leaders have found themselves having to explain why their vaccination programmes got off to a faltering start at the same time as tackling a third wave of the virus. With a booster jab potentially necessary in the autumn and supply chains strung out across national borders, however, ministers are acutely aware that they will need to reach some kind of agreement with the EU when discussions resume after this week's European council meetings. ""It's an ongoing problem. It could go on for months,"" said one government insider. There is less angst in Downing Street about the holdup of supplies from India, and more sympathy for Delhi's situation. Johnson's former chief of staff and trusted fixer Lord Lister has been dispatched, in part to pave the way for the prime minister's planned trip to India next month but also to try to unlock 5m doses the government had expected to receive. They were part of a 10m-dose order, half of which had already been sent before the Indian government in Delhi decided to prioritise domestic supply as cases surged. The UK believes the release of the remaining 5m doses is a matter of when, not if. Whitehall officials stress that the government's plans for unlocking the economy will remain on track even if vaccine supply is bumpy in the weeks ahead. They are based on all over-50s being vaccinated by mid-April, a target they are still confident can be met. The government is also looking at ways of bolstering domestic production and eagerly awaiting the arrival of the US-made Moderna vaccine, which is expected some time next month.",Real Guardian,605.0
702,Real,The Guardian,"All prospective parents should be able to access a ""Start for Life"" package of services that brings together the support available in their local area, to prevent families falling through the cracks, the government adviser Andrea Leadsom is urging. Leadsom, who was leader of the House of Commons in Theresa May's government, is chairing a review of the experience of families during the crucial first 1,001 days of their babies' lives.  She would like the new family hubs the government is creating to have a particular focus on the parents of the youngest children, allowing them to access midwives, health visitors, social workers and other experts. Highlighting that babies from more deprived backgrounds tend to suffer worse health outcomes, Leadsom is calling for all new parents to be offered a Start for Life pack, setting out what services they can access locally. The prime minister commissioned Leadsom to carry out the review and appointed her as a government adviser, but she has not yet convinced the Treasury to set aside extra funding to expand the availability of services. That will be now her task during a year-long implementation phase, during which she plans to submit a bid to next year's spending review. Asked whether she was simply advocating the recreation of Labour's Sure Start centres, many of which have been cut back or shut down over the past decade, Leadsom said she would expect many local authorities to merge the remaining centres with the hubs she is suggesting. ""I think the key thing with the family hubs is, they will be a welcoming place for all families: that's where Sure Start started,"" Leadsom said. ""We'll certainly be working with local authorities on how they can bring their Sure Start estate into the family hub network."" Leadsom would also like families to be given the chance to register their child's birth at the hubs, so they can access services at the same time. She added that evidence from families with new babies during lockdown pointed to the fact that the hubs should make many services – such as breastfeeding and mental health support – available online, to reach as many people as possible. Leadsom has also laid out plans to digitise the ""red books"" parents are given to record each child's developmental milestones, by 2023. The books, in which babies' weight and other measurements are recorded as well as their vaccination records and other health data, have to be retained by parents and taken to medical appointments. She believes a digital version would help to join up the different professionals who work with parents. ""This work is going to be undertaken during the implementation phase,"" she said. Health minister Jo Churchill said: ""Most babies are born healthy and enjoy a safe and nurturing childhood. However, some do not, therefore I am committed to removing barriers so all children are supported and nurtured so they are ready for life.

703,Real,The Guardian,"Interest-free government loans should be made available to help up to a million households buy electric cars over the next two years, the shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, is to argue. In a speech on Thursday, Miliband will set out Labour's plans for an ""electric vehicle revolution"" to promote a rapid increase in the take-up of electric cars as the UK moves towards net zero carbon.  With Boris Johnson already promising a ""green industrial revolution"" to bring new jobs to former industrial areas, Labour is keen to underline the fact that its own plans would be more radical. Miliband will say a Labour government would: part-finance three more gigafactories by 2025 to build the batteries for electric vehicles; fund interest-free loans for low- and middle-income households to help them cope with the upfront costs of buying an electric car; accelerate the creation of charging points, including in less well-served areas including Yorkshire, the north west of England and the West Midlands. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, recently announced £20m to help fund new charging points, as the government works towards its target of ending the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2030 – but Labour believes the government is not acting fast enough. In prereleased remarks, Miliband said: ""To back the car industry and create jobs, Labour would bring forward ambitious proposals to spark an electric vehicle revolution in every part of the country. ""By extending the option to buy an electric car to those on lower incomes and accelerating the rollout of charging points in regions that have been left out, we would ensure that everyone could benefit."" Labour estimates the cost to the government of each 100,000 new vehicles paid for via loans at £156m, and argues that the taxpayer should be willing to fund up to 1m purchases over the next two years. Last year 108,205 electric vehicles were sold, up 180% on a year earlier. They argue this would help to create new jobs in the industry by giving manufacturers certainty about future demand – and the funding should form part of a total £30bn investment in green jobs. In his speech, Miliband will stress the importance of tackling deep inequalities in the UK, at the same time as confronting the climate emergency. Keir Starmer has repeatedly pointed to dealing with inequality as one of the political dividing lines between his party and the government, highlighting the fact that some of the poorest households were those left most exposed to the Covid pandemic. Miliband is expected to say: ""What we cannot do is put a green coat of paint on our unequal, insecure economy. Every worker whose job might change, every consumer who may face a change in what they pay, every single person in this country has got to be at the centre of our concerns. This is the DNA of Labour: green and fair. Green and red together."" Miliband is keen to show that Labour remains as committed to the cause of environmentalism as it was under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. Plans for a ""green industrial revolution"" were at the heart of the 2019 manifesto – a phrase since appropriated by the Tories. The government is hoping for a successful outcome from the crucial Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in November, as Johnson tries to rebuild the UK's reputation as a collaborative global player in the wake of Brexit. Climate is expected to be on the agenda when the G7 nations meet in June – a gathering the prime minister hopes can be held in Cornwall, if coronavirus travel restrictions allow.",Real Guardian,601.0
704,Real,The Guardian,"At least 40% of households in four London boroughs are having to claim help with affording a place to live as the economic impact of Covid-19 exacerbates the housing crisis in urban areas, analysis reveals. Research by the Conservative thinktank Bright Blue found that the most significant increases in the proportion of households claiming state support for housing costs in the first nine months of the pandemic were in cities – particularly London.  In Newham, Haringey, Barnet and Hackney, 40% or more of households are now reliant on benefits – such as the housing element of universal credit – to meet part of their housing costs. Bright Blue published the research as it launches a cross-party commission on the future of social security, with members including the food campaigner Jack Monroe and the Labour peer and social policy expert Ruth Lister, as well as the former Tory work and pensions secretary Stephen Crabb. Much of the increase in claims for housing support has been within the private rented sector, the research found, with 212 of the 317 local authorities in England seeing at least 60% of new claims coming from private tenants. The smallest increases in housing claims were seen in rural areas, with the least-affected local authorities including the chancellor's leafy Richmondshire, where 12% of households claim housing support, up just 1.8% from before the pandemic. Richmondshire was recently placed in the highest tier for applying for the government's new £4.8bn ""levelling up fund,"" raising questions about how the money will be allocated. There are mounting concerns among charities and anti-poverty campaigners about what will happen when the government's support measures, such as the furlough scheme, which has protected millions of jobs, are phased out in the coming months. Rishi Sunak extended the £20-a-week increase in universal credit in his budget this month, but it is now due to expire in September, as he insists on the need to start repairing the public finances. The government is also freezing the level of local housing allowance (LHA), which determines how much private tenants can claim, after reconnecting it to a measure of average local rents a year ago. At the same time, the stamp duty holiday, which can tend to drive up property prices and therefore rents, was extended by another three months. LHA has been consistently eroded over the past decade, Bright Blue points out, so that by 2019, it did not meet the full cost of rent for claimants in 97% of areas. The thinktank's chief executive, Ryan Shorthouse, warned the government against making benefits claimants bear the burden of trying to balance the books. ""After the last economic crisis in the late 2000s, those claiming working-aged benefits experienced deep and disproportionate cuts to their incomes as the government repaired the public finances. That can't happen again,"" he said. Calls for reform of the welfare safety net have grown through the pandemic, as many people who had never expected to rely on benefits have found themselves asking for help. ""The pandemic has proven that almost all of us can fall on hard times because of random, unpredictable events,"" Shorthouse said. ""A popular and effective welfare system is needed to maintain participation in and support for our socio-economic system."" Lady Lister, welcoming the establishment of the commission, said: ""The pandemic has exposed and aggravated the extent of economic insecurity in our society as well as the cracks in the social security system, which mean that it is failing to provide genuine security."" Her remarks echoed those of Britain's leading expert on health inequalities, Michael Marmot, who has called for benefits to be increased significantly to curb a mental health crisis. Marmot, who produced a significant study on health inequalities in 2010, and whose work was recently praised by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, told the Observer the ""brutalising"" universal credit system should be reformed. ""Ideally, all people of working age should be in work. That's the desirable state. And in work, they should be paid a living wage. If they can't work, for whatever reason, then the welfare system should be sufficiently generous for their health not to be damaged by that experience. We know what needs to be done. Let's do it,"" he said. The commission is being funded by the Lloyds Bank Foundation – the bank's charitable arm – as well as the Trust for London.",Real Guardian,730.0
705,Real,The Guardian,"Senior figures in the Labour party were urged to smooth the rapid selection of Dr Paul Williams as Hartlepool's candidate in the forthcoming byelection by members of the local party, according to a letter seen by the Guardian. Williams's selection for the Hartlepool seat came just days after the sitting MP Mike Hill resigned over sexual harassment allegations, and Labour's ruling national executive committee (NEC) last week composed a ""longlist"" comprising only his name, sparking accusations of a stitch-up by the leadership.  It also appeared to undermine Labour's commitment to using all-women shortlists in key constituencies to increase female representation in the House of Commons. The Guardian has been passed a letter sent to Labour officials by the chair of Hartlepool CLP, Moss Boddy, last Tuesday, the day of Hill's resignation, calling on the NEC to ""find a way"" for Williams to be adopted as the candidate, ""without delay"". ""It is essential that our candidate be in place in the next few days, so that they can hit the ground running,"" the letter said, highlighting the need to avoid ""navel-gazing,"" and citing Williams's record as a ""proven local campaigner"". The letter says it reflects the position agreed by Hartlepool CLP's executive at an emergency meeting on Tuesday evening. Williams, who was an MP for Stockton South from 2017-2019, had been standing as the police and crime commissioner for Cleveland. Labour hopes his status as a local doctor who has served on the frontline through the pandemic will help him to win what is expected to be a difficult race; but the Conservatives have highlighted his past opposition to Brexit. Williams also had to apologise on Friday for ""inappropriate"" tweets sent a decade ago, including one referring to a ""favourite Tory milf"" and another that compared a burglary at the home of the Conservative MP Liam Fox to a sexual harassment scene in a movie. Shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, said on Sunday it was right that Williams had apologised, but he should now make clear what he had learned from the ""watershed moment"" of the past few weeks, when women's safety has been widely discussed in the light of Sarah Everard's murder. ""What I want to hear from him and from others who've made comments like this is that they're going to get this right in future,"" she told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. The Tories hope to take the Hartlepool seat from Labour – a rare feat for governing parties at byelections – cementing the gains they made in the north-east by winning the Tees Valley mayoralty in 2017, and taking several nearby parliamentary seats in 2019. Labour's selection process was criticised on Sunday by Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union. ""If that's Keir's definition of democracy well it's certainly not mine,"" he told Times Radio. ""It's not even a pretence any more. A shortlist – actually it was a longlist – of one man. It beggars belief."" He accused Starmer of undermining party democracy, and claimed the Labour leader risked being consigned to ""the dustbin of history"". With local and mayoral contests taking place across England on 6 May, as well as elections for the Scottish parliament and Welsh parliament, Labour is putting heavy focus in its campaigning on the national issue of NHS pay. The deputy Labour leader, Angela Rayner, will help launch Williams's byelection campaign for the 6 May on Monday. She will argue that the decision to recommend a 1% rise for NHS workers amounts to a real-terms pay cut for 7,000 staff in the Hartlepool area. ""After all they have done for us, this really is the ultimate insult and is a kick in the teeth for our hard-working NHS staff. The choice in Hartlepool is a clear one between a Conservative candidate who wants to cut nurses' pay, or Dr Paul Williams who has been working on the frontline at Hartlepool hospital and will stand up for our NHS heroes and our key workers,"" she said, ahead of her visit. Labour believes the Conservatives made a major political misstep by recommending a 1% increase, which amounts to a real-terms pay cut. However, government insiders point out that the final amount, once the independent pay review body has made its recommendation, is likely to be higher.",Real Guardian,715.0
706,Real,The Guardian,"The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has said the government will protect the success of its vaccination programme at all costs, as speculation grows that strict restrictions on foreign travel could continue into the summer. With cases rising in several EU countries and the South African variant becoming more prevalent in France, some experts have cautioned against lifting the holiday ban.  Mike Tildesley, a member of the Spi-M modelling group, which feeds into the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), has said continental holidays this summer currently appear extremely unlikely. Asked about the prospects for travel, Wallace said: ""We can't be deaf and blind to what's going on outside the United Kingdom. If you look in Europe, and the increases in infections, we can't put at risk the huge amount of effort, by the taxpayer, by the NHS, by our scientists, in developing this vaccine. ""And if we were to be reckless in any way, and import new variants that put it at risk, then what would people say about that?"" he asked Sophy Ridge on Sky News. ""We've got good direction of travel, we're getting there, and I think we need to make sure we preserve that at all costs."" Under the government's roadmap for exiting lockdown the current travel restrictions will remain in place until at least 17 May. The Department for Transport has set up a ""global travel taskforce"" to examine how holidays and other travel could be facilitated. The Cabinet Office is conducting a separate review of whether some form of Covid certificate could allow travellers to show that they have been vaccinated or have received a recent negative test result. The shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, underlined the need for the government to be careful. ""We're all desperate to go on holiday, but we've got to proceed with caution. We can't allow the good work that's been done by the vaccine rollout to be unravelled by unlocking too quickly, or by failing to secure our borders,"" she said on BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show. ""We've seen problems with that in the past."" Nandy also said she would not be booking an overseas holiday. With the EU's vaccination plan faltering, Wallace also warned the European commission against banning the export of vaccines when the bloc's leaders meet later this week. ""The world is watching what happens,"" he said, and cautioned against trying to unpick commercial contracts the UK government had made with EU drugmakers. The European commissioner Mairead McGuinness declined to rule out an export ban on Sunday. Appearing on the Marr show, she stressed the need for a calm approach and lamented what she called the ""AstraZeneca saga"". ""It's hugely disappointing, and European citizens are growing angry and upset at the fact that the vaccine rollout has not happened as rapidly as we had anticipated,"" she said. ""Both the EU and the UK have contracts with AstraZeneca. My understanding is that the company is supplying the UK but not the European Union. ""I think this is just about openness and transparency and addressing citizens' concerns. It's about nothing else.""",Real Guardian,516.0
707,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson went out of his way this week not to blame Delhi for the later-than-expected arrival of 5m doses of the Oxford vaccine from India, which is contributing to a significant dip in supplies in April. ""No, no, no,"" he said, when asked by a reporter whether Delhi had blocked the export of the vaccines, as the country battles a resurgence in Covid cases.  Instead, he praised the Serum Institute of India, which is manufacturing the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, and stressed the importance of a global approach. Johnson's remarks were in stark contrast to the robust response from the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, when the president of the European commission, Ursula Von der Leyen, threatened to slap an export ban on vaccines due to leave the EU. ""If the situation does not change, we will have to reflect on how to make exports to vaccine-producing countries dependent on their level of openness,"" Von der Leyen said earlier this week, in remarks widely interpreted as aimed at the UK. The EU's management of its vaccination programme has at times appeared chaotic, with several member states temporarily halting delivery of the AstraZeneca jab over safety concerns in recent days, at the same time as the commission was bemoaning a shortage of supplies. Leaked figures earlier this week showed that 34m doses of vaccines had been exported from EU manufacturing facilities, more than 9m of those to the UK. The UK insists these have been contracted and paid for, mainly from Pfizer. Raab hit back at Von der Leyen's comments, saying: ""Frankly, I'm surprised we're having this conversation. It is normally what the UK and EU team up with to reject when other countries with less democratic views than our own engage in that kind of brinkmanship."" The row with the EU appears to have been heightened by the Brexit situation, with many of the same personnel involved. But government insiders say the tough reaction to Von der Leyen's statement also reflects genuine concern in Whitehall at what moves the EU might now make, with cases rising sharply in some countries and vaccination programmes faltering. ""There's been a huge amount of alarm, because we're aware that they're in a very, very difficult place, and there's a risk of making very poor decisions that harm the bilateral relationship for years or even decades to come,"" said one official. Ministers are acutely conscious that supply chains for the vaccines and their components are global, and a slew of tit-for-tat export restrictions would have disastrous consequences. It is for that reason Johnson told the House of Commons: ""We oppose vaccine nationalism in all its forms"" – despite previously hailing various aspects of the the UK's pandemic response as ""world-beating"". The EU situation is different to the Indian delay, government insiders say. They point out that 5m doses have already been delivered from India, and the arrival of the rest is a matter of timing, with discussions continuing. ""There's a calm,"" said one Whitehall official involved. By contrast, the EU appeared to be suggesting tearing up commercial contracts. Emollience towards Delhi also suits the ""tilt"" towards the Indo-Pacific region outlined in Johnson's strategic and defence review this week, and which will be underlined when the prime minister visits India later in the spring. He won't want to fall out too badly with the EU either, however. Weighing on the prime minister's mind will be the fact that he is due to host leaders of the G7 nations in Cornwall in June (travel restrictions allowing), and will not want to do so against the backdrop of a vicious diplomatic spat. But this week's events have only strengthened the view in government that the safest way to secure supplies for future vaccine rounds – which Matt Hancock has said may have to begin with a booster shot in the autumn – is to bolster the UK's domestic capacity still further. Meanwhile, ministers will be watching developments in EU capitals very closely.",Real Guardian,663.0
708,Real,The Guardian,"Chris Whitty has insisted the British public are still keen to come forward and be vaccinated, despite several countries, including France, Spain and Italy, pausing delivery of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab claiming safety fears. The chief medical officer for England said there were anecdotal reports that a very small number of people had ""not turned up immediately after they have heard the news"" but many were likely to change their minds after a ""pause for thought"".  ""Overall there is no evidence of a significant problem, that people do not want vaccination,"" he said, urging anyone with concerns to weigh them against the risks of contracting Covid. Whitty emphasised the medical consensus over the safety of the jab, insisting: ""The overwhelming professional view of doctors around the world, and other health professionals, is these vaccines are highly effective against a dangerous infection that is common, and they are safe – very safe – relative to the risk of the infection."" He was speaking alongside Boris Johnson at a Downing Street press conference where the prime minister said he would receive the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine himself on Friday, as he reaffirmed its safety. The prime minister sought to reassure the public amid reports of blood clots that have led several countries to pause the delivery of the vaccine. Johnson highlighted a new statement from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) published on Thursday, setting out the latest evidence on the safety of the vaccination programme. ""They've confirmed that the benefits of the vaccine in preventing Covid far outweigh any risks, and people should continue to get their vaccine,"" the prime minister said. ""The Oxford jab is safe, the Pfizer jab is safe, the thing that is not safe is getting Covid."" The MHRA's chief executive, June Raine, said it had carried out a ""rigorous scientific review"" which showed that blood clots were occurring to no greater extent among the vaccinated population than would be expected in the absence of jabs. Raine said there had also been five reports of a rare form of cerebral blood clot, among 11 million patients receiving the vaccine. She said there was as yet no evidence of any causal link, but urged the public who had been vaccinated to seek medical attention if they have a headache, or bruising beyond the injection site, that lasts more than four days. Johnson also sought to play down the significance of a slowdown in supplies of the vaccine over the next month, insisting it would not prevent the government from meeting its target of vaccinating all over-50s by mid-April, and the entire adult population by the end of July. He stressed there would be no impact on the government's roadmap plan for progressively reopening the economy and society between now and late June. ""Our progress along the road to freedom remains unchecked,"" he insisted. Johnson praised the Serum Institute, which is manufacturing the Oxford vaccine in India, saying they were ""doing a herculean job in producing vaccines in such large quantities"". Asked whether ministers in Delhi had blocked the delivery of 4m doses from India that had been delayed, Johnson said: ""No, no, no."" He added: ""The Indian government hasn't stopped any export; there is a delay, as there is very frequently in vaccine rollout programmes. ""There is a huge amount of work that we want to do together and this is just the beginning.""",Real Guardian,566.0
709,Real,The Guardian,"Labour has thrown its weight behind calls for a full-blown public inquiry to learn the lessons of the Covid pandemic, with Rachel Reeves arguing it should kick off when the prime minister's roadmap comes to an end in June. Reeves, who shadows the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, told the Guardian the government should start preparing now, to allow an inquiry to begin in earnest over the summer.  ""We're supposed to be out of the roadmap by 21 June,"" said Reeves. ""Let's get ready for it now, and from 21 June this inquiry can really get started and use the summer months where we should be better protected, and the vaccine has been rolled out to most adults."" Reeves and the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, have heard first-hand from bereaved relatives in recent weeks – a moving experience which, she says hardened her view that a public inquiry must be held. ""It was one of the toughest meetings, with people whose grief was still so raw and recent. Some amazing people telling of terrible loss,"" she said. ""They want an inquiry because they want to understand what happened and whether anything more could have been done – but also, and I think this is probably the strongest argument, the lessons to be learned, because this is unlikely to be the last virus or disease that comes our way."" ""Justice is being denied, and they can't have closure until they better understand what happened,"" she added. She urged the government to work with bereaved families to decide how the inquiry should be set up. ""The inquiry is needed most of all by them. So, I think they should be in the driving seat really for how this is conducted, but it needs to be independent, it needs to be held in public. And it needs to be properly resourced,"" she said. The campaign group Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice is calling for a judge-led, statutory inquiry to be convened urgently. Reeves said: ""I don't expect Boris Johnson to listen to Keir Starmer or myself in calling for an inquiry, but I do hope he has the decency to listen to the voices of those who have lost someone, and will do the right thing."" Reeves has written to Gove, urging him to make a commitment to go ahead with an inquiry. ""This must be an independent, fully public inquiry, and it must not be delayed,"" she says in the letter. ""We can learn from the Chilcot and Hillsborough inquiries as to how this can be started in this parliament. With such a huge loss of life, justice delayed will be justice denied. Reeves has been a vocal critic of the outsourcing of key aspects of the government's pandemic response, and the ""crony contracts"" awarded to Conservative donors and contacts as the government scrambled to procure personal protective equipment. She said an inquiry should look at all aspects of the handling of the pandemic, from why frontline workers were not better protected to the timing of lockdown measures and the tragic deaths in the care system. ""So many people lost loved ones in care homes and weren't able to say goodbye,"" she said. She added that the pandemic had exposed many of the weaknesses in the care system – which Johnson claimed on his first day in office he had a plan to fix. ""It's casualisation, fragmentation, for-profit – so many things about the current system are broken,"" Reeves said. ""This virus exploits vulnerabilities, and the vulnerabilities were in the care system."" In addition, Reeves called for the investigation to examine the lack of resilience that Labour argues left both public services and individual households particularly exposed to the pandemic. She cited the fact that the UK has fewer intensive care beds per head than many other European countries – 7.3 intensive care beds for every 100,000 people, compared with 33.8 in Germany, for example – and had run down its stockpile of PPE equipment before the crisis. ""It's also the resilience of families,"" she added. ""Eleven and a half million adults went into this crisis with less than £100 worth of savings. There are a million people on zero-hour contracts, and that has made it harder for people to take the rights to make the right decisions for public health. ""People are having to make the choice about whether to feed their families, or to keep their community safe by self-isolating – and we all pay the price if for whatever reason people are not in a position to take the actions that are needed to contain the spread of the virus."" The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been pushing for more generous payments to workers self-isolating, but been rebuffed by the Treasury, which believes financial incentives are not the main reason many people fail to stay at home when requested to. When the death toll from the virus exceeded 100,000 earlier this year, the prime minister said his government, ""did everything we could"" in ""a very, very difficult stage, and a very, very difficult crisis for our country"". But Reeves said the government failed to learn lessons from the earlier phases of the pandemic.",Real Guardian,864.0
710,Real,The Guardian,"Emily Thornberry has accused the government of failing to carry out an economic impact assessment of Boris Johnson's Brexit deal, after two key government departments told the shadow international trade secretary they had no such document. As official figures showed a 40.7% decline in exports to the EU in January, Thornberry wrote to the international trade secretary, Liz Truss, to ask why she had published assessments of many much less significant deals but not the crucial Christmas Eve trade agreement with the EU.  When Thornberry challenged Truss in the House of Commons to produce economic analysis of the deal in January, the minister referred her to the EU taskforce in the Cabinet Office, which spearheaded the fraught negotiations. But when Thornberry made a freedom of information request to the Cabinet Office, she was referred to the Treasury, which replied that it ""does not hold a specific document meeting the terms of your request"". Johnson's spokesperson had previously said the government would not be publishing its analysis of the economic impacts of the deal, but Thornberry has now written to Truss to ask whether the government failed to carry out an analysis at all. ""It appears not that the government is refusing to publish the economic impact assessment it has conducted in relation to the UK-EU deal, but that no economic impact assessment was ever produced,"" she said in a letter seen by the Guardian. ""For an agreement of such immense importance for our country's economy, business, jobs and trade, that is utterly staggering. And when we compare it to the approach taken to the assessment of every other UK trade deal signed over the last two years, it makes no sense whatsoever."" She gave the example of the department's recent publication of analysis of the deal struck with Albania, a country with which trade was worth £45m in 2019. Trade with the EU is worth 15,000 times as much. Labour has begun to take a more aggressive approach to highlighting the shortcomings of Johnson's Brexit deal and the impact on businesses in recent weeks. Keir Starmer whipped his MPs to vote for the deal in December, saying Labour wanted to avert a no-deal exit and that it would still criticise the agreement. But he has made few mentions since of the impact of the end of the transition period on businesses. David Frost, who negotiated the deal and now sits in cabinet as the minister for EU relations, sought to play down the significance of January's sharp decline in exports, pointing out that many companies had stockpiled goods before the end of the transition period. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility has warned that short-term trade disruption is likely to knock 0.5% off GDP in the first quarter of this year. A government spokesperson said: ""Our deal with the EU represents one of the most comprehensive free trade agreements ever signed, and it's a good deal for British families, businesses and jobs.""

711,Real,The Guardian,"Pubs may not open until April, nightclubs until June, but for millions of frazzled parents across England, Monday will be the most eagerly awaited landmark on the long road back to normal life, when schools reopen their doors to all pupils. However, for Boris Johnson it will be the start of an anxious few weeks as the government's health experts monitor the impact of the ""big bang"" reopening on Covid infection rates.  In an open letter in January, the prime minister declared himself ""in awe"" of parents juggling home schooling with jobs and household chores. That is why No 10 made a deliberate decision to put the return to school at the top of the list of priorities for reopening, amid intense pressure from Tory backbenchers concerned about the impact on children's education and wellbeing, as well as parents' ability to work. Johnson rejected calls from ministers including the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, to send pupils back after the February half-term and instead set the date of 8 March – three weeks after the top four priority groups had received their first vaccine dose. The speed and scale of the inoculations – more than 20 million people have had their first jab so far – has given ministers more political wriggle room than they might have hoped for. And during the extra fortnight of Zoom lessons around the kitchen table the number of new cases dropped further – there were 6,573 new case on Thursday, fewer than half the number two weeks ago. But some experts are still wary about the ""big bang"" reopening, and government insiders remain acutely conscious that the return to school will mean a big change in the number of social connections made by many households. ""We feel like we're definitely confident on going ahead: infections are now at a lower rate and we've vaccinated a lot more people – but of course we acknowledge that there's likely to be some impact on cases: our challenge is to manage that,"" said a No 10 source. At its 11 February meeting, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) reaffirmed its expectation that schools reopening would increase the reproduction number of the disease, known as R, by 10%-50% – not just because of children mixing, but parents meeting at the school gates. The Department for Education hopes that the regular testing of teachers, school support staff and secondary school pupils, as well as the availability of at-home kits for the parents of school-age children, will help to reduce the risk of large-scale outbreaks by identifying asymptomatic cases. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, is also more confident that with the virus less prevalent it will be easier to track and control fresh outbreaks, in a way that became all but impossible as the second wave took hold in the winter. ""We have very, very detailed, quite granular levels of data – and because the prevalence is lower, there is less noise,"" said a Department of Health and Social Care source. Labour has also backed the wider reopening. ""We have always said that the best place for children to be is in schools: best for their learning and best for their social and emotional wellbeing,"" said the shadow education secretary, Kate Green. But she said she would still like to see more support given to schools to make the changes necessary to create a Covid-safe environment, such as testing, spacing pupils out and improving ventilation. ""Teachers and heads are still saying the government are not being forthcoming with help,"" she said, reiterating Labour's call for ""Nightingale classrooms"" to allow children to be taught safely without crowding. Unions representing teachers and other education staff issued a joint statement on Friday urging the government to review the impact of reopening over the Easter break. ""The timing of the current reopening offers an opportunity to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the early data findings during the Easter holidays and to act on this decisively if there are any indications of a spike in infections in any part of the country,"" they said. Johnson has promised to wait five weeks before proceeding to the next stage of his roadmap – four weeks to review the data, plus a week's notice to announce any changes to the plan. In effect from 8 March, all pupils and college students returned fully. Care home residents could receive one regular, named visitor. In effect from 29 March, outdoor gatherings allowed of up to six people, or two households if this is larger, not just in parks but also gardens.
Outdoor sport for children and adults allowed.
The official stay at home order ended, but people encouraged to stay local.
People still asked to work from home where possible, with no overseas travel allowed beyond the current small number of exceptions. In effect from 12 April, non-essential retail, hair and nail salons, and some public buildings such as libraries and commercial art galleries  reopened. Most outdoor venues can reopen, including pubs and restaurants, but only for outdoor tables and beer gardens. Customers will have to be seated but there will be no need to have a meal with alcohol.

712,Real,The Guardian,"The shadow communities secretary has accused the government of using taxpayers' money to ""shore up"" Tory votes with ""cosmetic"" projects in hand-picked constituencies, while failing to address the legacy of a decade of austerity. The Guardian has calculated that 39 of the 45 new recipients of towns fund handouts announced in Rishi Sunak's budget have Conservative MPs. Meanwhile, areas represented by five cabinet ministers including Sunak himself were placed in tier 1 for the levelling up fund, giving them access to taxpayer funding to help them apply for the £4bn pot.  ""It does really look like the Tories are trying to use taxpayers' money to shore up their own votes locally, rather than tackle the deeply ingrained inequalities that exist in our country as a result of what they've done with 10 years of austerity,"" said Steve Reed. ""They are spending money to their own political advantage."" The government is yet to make available the qualifying criteria for the levelling up fund, despite Sunak insisting at Wednesday's press conference that they were ""transparently published"". Reed has written to Sunak to ask him to release more details. He said the new fund, for which ministers in Whitehall will decide between competing bids, would be ""pitting areas against each other"" and replace just a fraction of the resources sucked out of communities by public spending cuts and anaemic economic growth. ""The money that's being distributed by the levelling up fund is just a drop in the ocean, compared to what the Conservatives took away over the last 10 years. It's like a burglar coming into your house in the dead of night, stripping your house bare and then expecting gratitude for giving you back your TV. ""It looks incredibly cosmetic, and it looks skewed towards the interests of the Conservative party, rather than the interests of the British people, living in areas that have been held back by a decade of austerity."" Reed pointed to a plan in the communities secretary's Newark seat to restore the gatehouse of a 12th-century castle with some of the £25m received from the towns fund. ""Doing up a medieval gatehouse might provide a lovely photo opportunity for Robert Jenrick ahead of the next election, but it will do absolutely nothing for the people and the communities in the region,"" Reed said. Echoing a theme of a recent speech by Keir Starmer, Reed said Sunak had failed to do anything in Wednesday's budget to tackle the underlying inequalities that contributed to the UK's high death toll and deep recession during the Covid pandemic. ""The reason that we got the worst recession of any major economy and the highest death toll in Europe wasn't by accident, it wasn't by chance. It's because our country is so extremely unequal compared to most of the rest of Europe and other major economies,"" he said. ""Many people in our country are on very, very low incomes or in insecure incomes. And they were afraid to go and get tested in case they were positive and had to self-isolate, and then couldn't afford to do it."" Reed argued that the government's method of doling out regeneration funds from Whitehall was part of its broader approach of retaining control, instead of handing power back to communities – something Labour hopes to make a political dividing line at the next general election. ""It seems to be in the DNA of the Conservatives, they just don't trust people, they don't trust communities, they want to control everything from the centre themselves, it's why they got so much wrong during the pandemic."" He highlighted Jenrick's controversial proposals for planning reform that would see some areas allocated as ""growth"" zones, in which the presumption would be in favour of new housing proposals going ahead. ""It would be entirely in order for a government to say to a local area, 'we need you to contribute the following number of new homes to a national target that we would need to achieve', but then allow that locality to choose the best way to achieve that. But instead of that, they've taken the voice of local communities away and handed power to their wealthy friends in the development community, who are funding them."" Reed, a former leader of Lambeth council, has represented Croydon North since 2012 and was closely involved in Starmer's leadership campaign. Asked about recent internal jitters over Starmer's leadership, he said: ""I think we need to give Keir some credit for starting to reconnect the Labour party, not just with the voters who stayed with us, but with the voters that we lost.""",Real Guardian,767.0
713,Real,The Guardian,"Rishi Sunak both is, and isn't, a typical Tory: he's an extravagantly rich, public school-educated former hedge fund manager; but also a coke-swigging Star Wars fan with a slick Twitter game who works from home in a hoodie. And his budget on Wednesday was, and wasn't, a typical Tory budget. Labour has repeatedly accused the Conservatives in recent weeks of wanting to return to ""business as usual"". But the political and economic terrain has been changed dramatically by the past 12 months, in ways that are likely to be long-lasting.  Sunak's statement was shot through with reminders of the extraordinary support the government has put in place during the Covid crisis. Once you've promised to do ""whatever it takes,"" to support businesses and subsidise jobs, it's politically all but impossible to ""pull out the rug"", as the prime minister put it recently. When the chancellor tried to turn off the furlough scheme last autumn, it was the resurgence of Covid that stopped him – but also the expectations of millions of workers whose jobs had been kept afloat by the taxpayer. Perhaps stung by that experience, the chancellor has now decided to ""go long,"" as he called it, extending many of the support schemes for months, well beyond the end of the government's planned ""roadmap"". The Treasury now puts the total cost of emergency Covid measures at a historically extraordinary £352bn. And even once the worst of the pandemic is over, while Sunak is very keen to redraw exactly the political dividing line that served George Osborne so well in 2010 and 2015 – sensible Tories vs spendthrift Labour – he is doing so in a different way. While public sector spending cuts, many of them hitting welfare claimants who could ill bear them, were Osborne's weapon of choice for balancing the books, Sunak claimed the Tories are now the party of public services. So big businesses will pay, through higher corporation taxes, with smaller firms carefully excluded to dampen the backlash from Tory MPs, and middle-earners will be caught up in what economists call ""fiscal drag"" – paying more tax because thresholds are not moving up in line with inflation. Cutting corporation tax was a trademark policy for the Osborne-Cameron government, symbolising what was then the Conservatives' ideal of global competition. Increasing it back to 2010 levels has been a Labour policy for years – and once Sunak's increases are implemented, the overall tax burden in the UK will be back at levels last seen when Roy Jenkins was chancellor in the 1960s. Hardly the ""same old Tories"". Indeed, the relatively muted reaction from the Tory back benches underlined the fact that it's not just the economic context that has changed, but the shape of the Conservative party. Philip Hammond and many of his fellow fiscal hawks have either been swept out of parliament or relegated to the very back benches – and many of the noisiest voices in the parliamentary party are those of the new MPs from the red wall seats, for whom small-c fiscal conservatism is less of a cherished cause. Many of them were buoyed by the announcement that they may receive a handout from the new ""levelling-up fund"". Labour dismisses this as pork barrel spending, shovelled out to favoured constituencies – but also privately concede it is hard to counter. Yet there were aspects to Sunak's approach that were depressingly familiar from the past decade of Conservative governments. The £20-a week universal credit increase has been retained, but only until September, when removing it will still increase child poverty and hit cash-strapped households hard. Overseas aid is still being cut; unspecified cuts in departmental public spending of up to £4bn are now pencilled in for future years; and public sector pay is being frozen for many workers, as Sunak announced last autumn. And as Keir Starmer rightly identified in his response to Sunak's statement – one of the toughest gigs for an opposition leader – many pressing issues were completely missing from the chancellor's statement – social care, the NHS, inequality, insecure work. Johnson and Sunak have a specific, and narrow idea of what ""levelling up"" and ""building back better"" means: infrastructure projects, business investment, low-tax buccaneering freeports. To counter it, rather than caricature them as textbook Tories, Starmer will need to fill out his own, as yet rather thin, picture of what post-pandemic Britain could look like.",Real Guardian,735.0
714,Real,The Guardian,"Rishi Sunak has kicked off budget day with a dire warning to his cabinet colleagues that it would not be ""right or responsible"" for a Conservative government to ignore the scale of government borrowing caused by the Covid crisis. Giving the cabinet a preview of his budget plans on Wednesday morning, the chancellor stressed that the cost of supporting the economy and the NHS through the pandemic had taken borrowing to levels usually only seen in wartime.  According to a readout issued by No 10, the chancellor said ""we must be honest with ourselves and the country about what that has meant. We are borrowing on an extraordinary scale – equivalent only to wartime levels."" ""He said that, as a Conservative government, we know that we cannot ignore this problem and it wouldn't be right or responsible to do so."" With Keir Starmer – along with many economists – warning against immediate tax increases because of the risks of choking off the recovery, Sunak is keen to draw a political dividing line with Labour, portraying the opposition as irresponsible. Starmer's caution has alarmed some in his own party, who would like Labour to back some tax increases – on businesses that have performed well during the crisis, for example. The chancellor is widely expected to set out a package of tax increases in Wednesday's statement, alongside confirming that key economic support measures, including the furlough scheme, will be extended. Some Conservative backbenchers have joined Labour in warning against tax increases, fearing they will hit businesses and consumers already struggling to emerge from the crisis. Sunak told the cabinet that despite the deep downturn caused by shuttering many sectors of the economy for months on end, he was ""optimistic"" about the future, and would set out investment plans aimed at making the UK a ""science superpower"". And he claimed the government's costly rescue measures were possible only because of ""the prudence of the Conservative government over a long period of time, which meant the country had gone into the crisis with strong public finances"". Sunak told his colleagues the budget would ""begin the work of building our future economy"", by investing in skills and infrastructure, and contribute to the government's aim of ""levelling up"" the UK.",Real Guardian,376.0
715,Real,The Guardian,"World leaders could have cut the length of the Covid outbreak by three months if they had collaborated on vaccines, testing and drugs, Tony Blair has claimed as he launched a report on preparing for the next deadly pandemic. The former Labour prime minister urged the UK to take the lead in developing a new ""health security infrastructure"" that would ensure countries coordinate better in identifying emerging new threats as well as developing, testing and manufacturing vaccines and treatments.  ""Had there been global coordination a year ago, I think we could have shaved at least three months off this virus,"" Blair told the Guardian in an interview. The report, The New Necessary, published by his Institute for Global Change, argues that in future, with the right international coordination and investment, the creation of a new vaccine could be achieved in as little as 100 days. ""The time that it's taken for us to identify the virus, to develop a vaccine and to get it into production and distribution has been roughly, 15 months. And the result of that has been that the world has suffered a huge, catastrophic economic event as well as a health event,"" he said. ""The obvious lesson to draw for the future is, number one, you have to prepare for the potential of this happening again, or with different variants of this particular virus. And number two, you cannot afford to take this long to get on top of it."" With Boris Johnson chairing the G7, Blair called on the UK to spearhead the creation of a more responsive system for tracking diseases and collaborating on tackling them. The report calls on the government to treat preparing for the next pandemic as ""akin to a military operation"", tracking the emergence of new diseases using state-of-the-art surveillance and having ""surge capacity"" ready to produce vaccines and drugs. It calls for pandemics to be dealt with as potential security threats – like climate change or cyber-attacks, Blair says – to ensure the issue gets the government time and attention it requires. Johnson was criticised for skipping several Cobra meetings in the early days of the pandemic, leaving them to be chaired by the health secretary, Matt Hancock. Perhaps ironically, for someone regarded by his critics as an arch free marketeer, Blair argues that in tackling the virus over the past year, ""there was a whole series of things left to the market which it was never sensible to leave to the market"". As an example, he points the bioreactors needed to produce vaccines. ""A lot of the companies that were developing the vaccines didn't have large bioreactor capacity, whereas a lot of the bioreactor capacity was in other large pharmaceutical companies who weren't doing the vaccines. Now, in a rational world you would have been repurposing some of that bioreactor capacity to accelerate the production of vaccine. I don't think that was even the discussion that took place at an international level."" Blair's institute is part thinktank, part consultancy, advising global leaders on how to make use of emerging technologies. He has made a series of high-profile interventions during the crisis, advocating some measures that have subsequently been adopted by the UK government, including mass testing and more recently vaccine passports. Having previously denied it was considering the idea, the government this week announced a review of the idea of ""Covid status certificates"" that would allow people to demonstrate they have been vaccinated or had a recent negative test result. Blair, who faced a political revolt when he tried to introduce a nationwide system of ID cards as prime minister, argues that some kind of certification system is inevitable, so the government should take control of it rather than allow it to develop ad hoc. ""What is obvious is that if people are going to be in close proximity with others, they'll probably prefer to know their Covid status – either test or vaccine,"" he said. ""Then the only question is, do you just let the system grow up topsy-turvy, with people doing their own thing, and making their own rules and regulations around it, or to try and systematise it. And I just think it's inevitable that you will move to the second,"" he said. He brushed off claims that some groups – those without access to technology, for example – would be disadvantaged. ""There's a big problem with the inequality between different people with digital connection, but you deal with that by dealing with the problem."" In response to the idea that such certificates – likely to be held on people's mobile phones – would create privacy issues like those that helped to sink his ID cards plan, he said: ""You know, my personal view is that this resistance was always exaggerated. It was loud, but not actually that broad. I used to say to people, you know, your average supermarket's got more information on you than the government's got.""",Real Guardian,825.0
716,Real,The Guardian,"When Keir Starmer chose to make taxation one of the dividing lines with the Tories at prime minister's questions on Wednesday, he was returning to a familiar recent theme. Keen to underline their pro-business credentials, he and the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, have both been making the point for weeks that this is not the time to raise taxes, including on companies.  But with reports suggesting the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, may announce increases in corporation tax and capital gains tax at next week's budget, the possibility opened up of a Tory chancellor proposing to tax big business to pay for the crisis – and Labour opposing it. That united Starmer's two groups of internal critics: those who worry that he is too centrist, and those who broadly back his politics but would like him to be bolder in setting out his stall. Starmer wants to make tackling social and economic inequalities a central theme of his leadership, as he set out in a speech last week. A more progressive tax system will inevitably have to be part of that, and it is highly likely to involve increasing the UK's internationally low corporation tax rates, a policy that Labour supported both in 2015 and 2019. During his leadership campaign, as fellow Labour MPs were quick to point out, Starmer said he would ""reverse the Tories' cuts in corporation tax"". But for now, Starmer's team are wary of being saddled with the old caricature of Labour being the party of tax and spend, spend, spend – and keen not to say too much about policy at all, so far away from a general election. And Starmer's team believe that economically, now is the wrong time to increase taxes. Just as George Osborne's spending cuts clobbered demand following the global financial crisis, the argument goes, mid-pandemic is not the time to weigh down struggling businesses and consumers with higher tax bills. They're not alone in that. The global consensus on tax-and-spend has changed radically in the decade since Osborne accused Labour of failing to ""fix the roof while the sun was shining"". Across developed economies, there is an acceptance that the height of a pandemic is not the time to ""pull the rug out"", as the prime minister phrased it earlier this week. But the party's coyness about future policy meant Wednesday's argument against tax increases was easily read – including by some irritated Labour frontbenchers – as a repudiation of the plan to increase corporation tax. Some shadow cabinet sources complained that the policy had been set out before it had been fully worked through. Labour leftwingers with long memories feared the influence of Peter Mandelson, who helped repair Labour's relationship with business in the early 1990s, and whom Starmer's team concede they have been talking to. It may also have opened the door for an opportunist No 10 to say it is prepared to force businesses that have done well out of the crisis to chip in, while Labour is not. Corporation tax is paid only on profits, so the firms hardest hit by the crisis would be unlikely to be affected. The shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, was sent out to flesh out Labour's position on BBC Two's Politics Live on Thursday. She said that for some businesses an increased corporation tax bill could be the difference between survival and going under, but also conceded that Labour was not against future hikes in corporation tax. ""There will be a time for raising taxes, doing it fairly, and paying down the debt – but that time is not now,"" she said. That carefully calibrated position – increase business taxes, but not now – appeared to have smoothed over the worst of the ructions over Labour's approach. But if Sunak does opt for a package of immediate tax increases on businesses, selling it as the few winners from the past grim year paying their fair share for the costs of the pandemic, Starmer could come under internal pressure to back it.",Real Guardian,670.0
717,Real,The Guardian,"The government is investigating the use of ""Covid status certificates"" to help allow society to reopen, Boris Johnson has announced, as he set out a cautious, four-step unlocking plan for England that will see some sectors remain shuttered until June. ""The end really is in sight; and a wretched year will give way to a spring and a summer that will be very different and incomparably better than the picture we see around us today,"" the prime minister told MPs on Monday as he announced the unlocking plan.  Ministers have repeatedly denied that they would consider the domestic use of so-called vaccine passports, fearing they pose risks of discrimination, as some groups are unable to receive the coronavirus jab. But as part of the government's roadmap out of England's national lockdown, a review will be carried out to assess whether certificates could allow restrictions to be lifted more safely. It is expected to report before June. In a nod to potential objections, Johnson said the review would be, ""mindful of the many concerns surrounding exclusion, discrimination and privacy"". The keenly awaited roadmap, which the government insists will be dependent on ""data, not dates"", lays out a four-step reopening process that will see the ""stay at home"" order remain in place for a further five weeks. With the prime minister keen to avoid having to order a fresh lockdown, he has opted for a gradual lifting of restrictions across England, which is likely to irk some Conservative MPs, who will be given a vote on the plan next month. Schools will reopen to all pupils on 8 March. The only other change at that point will be that two people from different households will be able to meet outside socially, instead of just for exercise. From 29 March, in the second part of step one, the ""stay at home"" order will lift so people can meet family members in a park or garden, and outdoor sports facilities will be allowed to reopen. In step two, from 12 April, hairdressers and non-essential shops will be allowed to reopen, as well as self-catering accommodation, public buildings such as libraries and museums, and outdoor hospitality such as pub gardens. From 17 May, in step three, most rules on outdoor social contact will be lifted, aside from a limit of 30 on the size of gatherings. Pubs and restaurants will be able to serve customers indoors. In step four, from 21 June, all limits on socialising should be lifted and the government hopes that businesses that were unable to reopen in summer 2020, such as nightclubs, will be able to reopen their doors. The five-week gap between the phases is intended to allow four weeks for data to emerge about the impact of the changes on the disease and a week's notice for the next stage of easing to be introduced. ""The chief medical officer is clear that moving any faster would mean acting before we know the impact of each step, which would increase the risk of us having to reverse course and reimpose restrictions. I won't take that risk,"" the prime minister told the House of Commons. Johnson told MPs: ""We're setting out on what I hope and believe is a one-way journey to freedom."" He said there was ""no credible route"" to a zero-Covid Britain - or a zero-Covid world - and argued: ""We cannot persist indefinitely with restrictions that debilitate our economy, our physical and mental wellbeing, and the life chances of our children."" The factors the government will consider in weighing whether to proceed with the planned dates are: the progress of the vaccination programme; news on new variants of the disease; the shift in hospitalisations and deaths; and whether the number of new infections risks overwhelming the NHS. There was no firm news for families hoping to have a summer break abroad. The government said the ban on international travel would continue until at least 17 May. Meanwhile, ministers will carry out a review into how travel – both inbound and outbound – could safely resume, and what measures should be put in place to facilitate it. Another review will be carried out into mask-wearing, social distancing and working from home, all of which are expected to continue for the time being. That review is expected to be completed before step 4 is implemented in June. Unlike last autumn, when different tiered restrictions were imposed at local level, the changes will be England-wide – though small-scale local lockdowns could be imposed if worrying evidence of new variants emerges. Johnson sought to reassure businesses about the financial impact of the gradual reopening plan, promising ""we will not pull the rug out"" – but left the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to set out the details in next week's budget. Over time, scientists expect Covid-19 to become endemic, meaning the virus will reach a stable, hopefully manageable level. Vaccinations – including revaccinations – will be key to managing the transition from pandemic to endemic state. Therapeutics and antivirals will become increasingly important, replacing most non-pharmaceutical interventions over the long-term.",Real Guardian,846.0
718,Real,The Guardian,"Care home residents in England will be allowed to receive indoor visits from one person from 8 March as lockdown restrictions start to be eased, the health secretary has said. As the prime minister prepares to announce his ""roadmap"" out of lockdown, Matt Hancock announced that each care home resident would be able to designate one person, who will be able to visit them regularly.  The visits will take place under strict conditions, with the designated person required to take a coronavirus test beforehand and wear personal protective equipment. They will not be required to prove that they have received the Covid vaccination, however. The visitor will be able to hold the resident's hand – though any other close contact will be discouraged. Prof Deborah Sturdy, the chief nurse for adult social care, said: ""I know how much people want to visit, hug and kiss their loved ones but doing so can put lives at risk, so we would ask people to continue to follow the rules."" She added: ""This is a first step towards resuming indoor visits and we all hope to be able to take further steps in the future. I am pleased as a result of so many people following the rules we are in a position to increase visits and hope this is just the start."" Relatives' groups have been campaigning for families to be allowed more access to their loved ones, saying that regular contact with familiar people is a lifeline for those with conditions such as dementia. Hancock said: ""I know how important visiting a loved one is and I'm pleased we will soon be in a position for people to be carefully and safely reunited with loved ones who live in care homes. ""This is just the first step to getting back to where we want to be. We need to make sure we keep the infection rate down, to allow greater visiting in a step-by-step way in the future."" The move is likely to be one of only a few easements announced on 22 February, when Boris Johnson sets out the plan for leaving lockdown. The campaign and support groups Rights for Residents, the Relatives and Residents Association and John's Campaign urged ministers this week to allow residents to select an essential caregiver to make in-person visits indoors and without screens. They cited falling rates of Covid transmission in the community and the need to balance the risk from the virus with the risk of isolation and lack of connection. But some care operators have raised concerns about the move, fearing the infection risk from new virus variants. They also say many cannot get insurance cover for Covid risks, including infection being introduced by visitors. Nadra Ahmed, who chairs the National Care Association, welcomed the news after a ""gruelling"" year, but said people needed to be careful. ""We have no insurance in our services for Covid-related risks. That still hasn't been sorted out by government in any way, so there will be all sorts of things about mitigating risks. But the default is we want to enable this visiting,"" she told BBC Breakfast. Age UK said people could now have hope that their ""nightmarish, prolonged separation"" from loved ones was nearing an end. Caroline Abrahams, the director of the charity, said: ""It makes sense for the first step to be to allow 'essential care-giving visitors' back into care homes because these individuals are so crucial to the health and wellbeing of the residents they support."" ""In their absence we know that some older people have stopped eating and drinking, despite the best efforts of staff to take their place. Sometimes, only the person you love most in the world will do."" Liz Kendall, the shadow social care minister, said: ""For the last seven months, backed by Labour and charities, families have been calling for care home visits to start again and to be treated as key workers with access to all the PPE and testing they need. ""Over this period ministers have repeatedly failed to grasp how important families are for the physical and mental health of care home residents, and the appalling impact preventing visits has caused. ""Never again must families be denied the right to visit their loved ones in care homes. To have any confidence that things will really change, we need legislation to enshrine residents' rights to visits and end the scandal of blanket visiting bans."" According to previous Department of Health of Social Care guidance, ""Visiting should be supported and enabled wherever it is possible to do so safely … This means finding the right balance between the benefits of visiting on wellbeing and quality of life, and the risk of transmission of Covid-19 to social care staff and clinically vulnerable residents."" Different homes and local authorities have interpreted the guidance differently, leading to a postcode lottery for the relatives of those in residential care.

719,Real,The Guardian,"Keir Starmer will use a major speech on Thursday to claim that the coronavirus pandemic has hit the UK disproportionately hard because 10 years of Conservative rule ""weakened the foundations of our society"". The Labour leader, who has faced internal criticism in recent weeks for failing to chart a clear political course, will say Rishi Sunak's budget next month is ""a fork in the road"" and should be a moment to ""diagnose the condition of Britain and to start the process of putting it right"".  ""We can go back to the same insecure and unequal economy that has been so cruelly exposed by the virus, or we can seize this moment and go forward to a future that is going to look utterly unlike the past,"" Starmer will say. He will argue that the aftermath of the pandemic that has claimed more than 100,000 lives, with those in poorer communities disproportionately hit, calls for a Beveridge-style reassessment of life in the UK. ""The terrible damage caused by the virus to health and prosperity has been all the worse because the foundations of our society had been weakened over a decade,"" he will say. ""This must now be a moment to think again about the country that we want to be. A call to arms – like the Beveridge Report was in the 1940s."" The report paved the way for the welfare state. Boris Johnson has insisted he wants to ""build back better"" from the pandemic, but the Labour leader will suggest the prevarication over whether to extend the £20-a-week increase in universal credit introduced a year ago showed that the Tories were only offering ""a roadmap to yesterday"". By contrast, Starmer will say the pandemic has ""shifted the axis on economic policy"" and Labour would seek a new relationship between government, the public and business, with no return to ""business as usual"". ""The age in which government did little but collect and distribute revenue is over. The mistakes of the last decade have made sure of that,"" he will say. ""I believe people are now looking for more from their government – like they were after the second world war. They're looking for government to help them through difficult times, to provide security and to build a better future for them and their families. They want a government that knows the value of public services, not just the price in the market."" Starmer will argue that the Conservatives undermined the country's resilience by cutting back public services and leaving too many people vulnerable to the pandemic because of inequality, insecure jobs and overcrowded housing. Allies say he has been influenced by Prof Michael Marmot's landmark work on health inequalities. Marmot was commissioned by the last Labour government to examine the underlying causes of the stark differences in healthy life expectancy across the UK. Reviewing the impact of his work in 2019 against the backdrop of a decade of austerity, Marmot said a more progressive tax system might be necessary to tackle health inequalities. He has recently given a presentation to the shadow cabinet, according to one Labour source. Starmer hopes his critique of the government for undermining the UK's resilience to the pandemic will lay the groundwork for an attack on the Tories as effective as George Osborne's claim that Gordon Brown failed to ""fix the roof while the sun is shining"". Osborne and David Cameron's success in pinning the blame for the 2008 financial crash on what they claimed was Labour mismanagement of the public finances helped shape the debate in the 2010 general election and beyond. Some of the Labour leader's critics have argued that he has failed to land enough blows on Johnson for mismanaging the Covid crisis – or to link the government's failings to a wider narrative. As well as seeking to address that challenge, the speech, to be delivered from Labour headquarters by video-link, is also expected to set out new policies. Another influence, Starmer's allies say, is new CBI director-general Tony Danker's recent speech advocating ""governments and businesses working together"" to tackle challenges such as decarbonising the economy. One frontbench colleague said the speech marked a shift away from focusing solely on Johnson's incompetence, towards setting out a distinct political stance. ""He wants to put an ideological stake in the ground,"" the MP said. The shadow cabinet office minister, Rachel Reeves, recently promised a wave of ""insourcing"" to undo the large-scale use of private contracts to carry out key public services, and Starmer has reaffirmed Labour's intention of abolishing tuition fees – but some internal critics have complained that the policies are not yet part of a coherent story.",Real Guardian,777.0
720,Real,The Guardian,"Legislation to pave the way for a US-style defence research agency to back high-risk research projects is set to be announced, government sources confirmed. The idea, which was in the 2019 Conservative manifesto, was the brainchild of Boris Johnson's former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, who has written extensively about the success of the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa).  Some commentators had expected it to be quietly shelved after Cummings' departure from No 10 but ministers said they thought it would help the UK to be at the cutting edge of developing technologies. An announcement from the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, could be made as soon as this week, with £800m of funding set aside. The UK version is expected to be called the Advanced Research and Invention Agency (Aria). Kwarteng's intention is for the agency to be free of some of the rules that usually govern investments made with taxpayers' money so that it can back projects in the knowledge that they could fail, government sources said. The agency is also expected to be exempted from the Freedom of Information Act – a move that will raise concerns that it could become a secretive nexus between the government and arms industry. The Conservative manifesto said the agency would ""support blue skies research and investment in UK leadership in artificial intelligence and data"". Darpa, which has existed for more than 60 years, works closely in the US with private-sector firms and has been involved in the early-stage development of many technologies originally created for defence purposes but which have had much wider use. In a 2017 blogpost, Cummings wrote: ""In the 1960s and 1970s a combination of unusual people and unusually wise funding from ARPA created a community that in turn invented the internet … and the personal computer."" Cummings said he believed freeing the UK from the constraints of EU state aid rules after Brexit would allow taxpayers to back creative early-stage research. When Cummings left Downing Street last year there was speculation that he might be given the plum job of leading the powerful new agency, but government sources played that down on Wednesday. ""The agency is independent of government. It will have its own chair and chief executive – that's for the agency to decide,"" a business department source said. The hope is for the new body to be up and running by 2022. During last year's general election campaign Johnson claimed leaving the EU would make it easier for the government to back businesses.",Real Guardian,420.0

Asked whether taking snaps of the dog was an appropriate use of taxpayers' money, the prime minister's spokesperson said: ""These photographers document the work of government, as well as the work inside No 10."" He added that the photographer was ""a cross-government resource"" who would ""support other government departments in their work, and other cabinet ministers and ministers in the work they're undertaking"". Responding to the suggestion the dog was part of the government, a Labour source said: ""The government has made such a dog's dinner of issues from the border response to kids' education.

The spokesperson confirmed Johnson had three photographers on the government payroll: his special adviser and longtime photographer, Andy Parsons; a Ministry of Defence photographer on secondment in Downing Street; and a new recruit. The government's annual report on special advisers revealed that Parsons, who took a posed shot of Johnson signing his resignation letter when he left Theresa May's cabinet, works part-time on a pay rate equivalent to a full-time salary of £100,000 a year.

The Observer revealed at the weekend that the Road Haulage Association (RHA) had written to the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, last week suggesting there had been a drop of as much as 68% in the volume of goods exports passing through UK ports and calling for an ""urgent intervention"". Whitehall sources vehemently rejected that claim, insisting freight flows were up to 95% or even 100% of normal levels on some days in January – though part of the RHA's argument was that in many cases lorries were travelling back empty from the UK to the EU. ""We don't recognise these figures at all,"" said a Cabinet Office spokesperson, adding: ""We know there are some specific issues and we are working with businesses to resolve them."" A government spokesperson said: ""Thanks to the hard work put in by hauliers and traders to get ready for the end of the Brexit transition period, there are no queues at the Short Straits, disruption at the border has so far been minimal, and freight movements are now close to normal levels, despite the Covid-19 pandemic. ""As a responsible government, we made extensive preparations for a wide range of scenarios at the border, including the reasonable worst case. However, it appears increasingly unlikely that our reasonable worst case scenario will occur."" However, the RHA's figure was corroborated by Richard Ballantyne, the chief executive of the British Ports Association, who said it was ""broadly in line"" with his experience since new year. While the worst disruption has been experienced in Northern Ireland, where shoppers have at times been confronted by empty supermarket shelves, UK exporters from fishing firms to plant nurseries have complained of significant problems. Shellfish exporters have been taken aback by a ban on the export of unprocessed bivalve molluscs such as oysters and scallops. The government had hoped the ban could be lifted in April, but the European commission suggested last week that the rule, which applies to imports to the EU from third countries, would remain indefinitely. Chris Vinnicombe, who fishes for oysters on the Fal estuary in Cornwall, told BBC Politics South West: ""Boris [Johnson]'s wonderful deal for the fishing industry – which obviously it is not – this deal should have actually incorporated the likes of live bivalve molluscs. This is going to end up as a complete write-off. It's going to finish the whole fishery here. The Fal oyster fishery is one small part of it. This is a countrywide problem."" Some Brexiters, including the Conservative MP John Redwood, have argued that the government should support the shellfish industry to sell more of its product to UK consumers. Meanwhile, the Scottish National party is calling on the government to demand a ""grace period"" for Scotland, as it has for Northern Ireland, to allow Scottish exporters, including the fishing sector, more time to get used to the new post-Brexit regime. Gove last week conceded there were ""serious problems"" with the operation of the new Irish Sea border, and called on the EU to delay until 2023 the application of EU customs and product standards. The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said: ""Ultimately, the only way to protect Scotland's economy is to become an independent country and regain the full trading benefits of EU membership. In the meantime, it is crucial that the UK government delivers the immediate support and financial compensation that Scotland requires – including an emergency grace period to mitigate the damage of Brexit. ""The Tory government has already sought a grace period for Northern Ireland until 2023 but yet again Scotland's interests have been sidelined. Any deal for Northern Ireland is welcome – but Scotland must get the same instead of being left out in the cold again. Gove will be questioned by MPs on the EU scrutiny committee on Monday, along with senior officials from the Cabinet Office transition taskforce.",Real Guardian,738.0
723,Real,The Guardian,"A Labour government would launch a radical programme of ""insourcing"" to bring public services back under democratic control, the frontbencher Rachel Reeves will say as she accuses Boris Johnson of handing £2bn of Covid contracts to Conservative ""cronies"". The shadow cabinet office minister and close ally of the party leader, Keir Starmer, has repeatedly highlighted the failings of private sector contractors, most recently by urging the government to ""sack Serco"" from its role in tracing the contacts of Covid cases.  Reeves will use a speech at Labour's London headquarters on Monday to attack the government for spending lavishly on contractors throughout the pandemic, without adequate oversight. Labour claims more than £2bn of taxpayers' money has been spent on products and services provided by firms with a financial or personal connection to the Conservative party. Contracts highlighted by the party include those awarded to Randox, the testing company that has employed the Conservative MP Owen Paterson as a consultant, and Hanbury, the political consultancy whose founders included the senior Vote Leave figure Paul Stephenson. ""This current Tory party is rife with conflicts of interest. It's all cheques and no balances,"" Reeves is expected to say. Normal rules for tendering public contracts were suspended early in the pandemic to allow ministers to move quickly in securing necessary supplies – but Reeves will accuse the government of using the fast-track system favour firms of friends or donors or with other links to the party. ""This government has eroded not only our public services to the brink of collapse, but so much of what it means to be an honourable and transparent government,"" she is due to say. And with Starmer's top team facing internal criticism about the failure to set out concrete policy, Reeves will also outline what a Labour government would do differently. She will say the party would launch the biggest wave of ""insourcing"" in a generation, bringing contracts back under the control of central and local government. Labour would also extend the freedom of information act to public services provided by private companies, to allow journalists and campaigners to scrutinise taxpayer-funded contracts. And Reeves will promise the creation of a new integrity and ethics commission to ""guarantee standards in government"". ""While this Tory government has denied key workers in our public services a pay rise, they paid 900 management consultants at Deloitte £1,000 a day to work on test and trace,"" she is to say. ""The beating heart of our country is the key workers who have kept us going through this last year. That's why we applauded them. Children weren't banging pots and pans for management consultants. They were clapping our key workers."" An investigation by the National Audit Office found the government had not always made available sufficient documentation to allow scrutiny of procurement decisions made during the pandemic. ""The lack of adequate documentation means we cannot give assurance that government has adequately mitigated the increased risks arising from emergency procurement or applied appropriate commercial practices in all cases,"" the NAO said. ""While we recognise that these were exceptional circumstances, there are standards that the public sector will always need to apply if it is to maintain public trust."" As a backbencher, Reeves chaired the business select committee's inquiry into the chaotic collapse of the construction firm Carillion, which held more than 400 public sector contracts. Her speech comes as Labour councils urge the government to hand more powers to local authorities to tackle unemployment and kickstart their economies, instead of relying solely on the private sector. Analysis by the Local Government Association Labour group suggests 5.4 million people are either furloughed or claiming jobseeker's allowance in England. More than 1.1 million of those are in the capital, with other hard-hit areas including Birmingham (140,000), Leeds (76,000) and Manchester (68,000). The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is expected to extend the furlough scheme in next month's budget, but as Covid restrictions are lifted and the scheme unwound in the coming months firms will have to decide whether to bring staff back into full-time employment. The LGA Labour group's leader, Nick Forbes of Newcastle city council, said: ""Councils want to do everything we can to fire local economies and create opportunities. From test and trace to PPE we've seen government make the wrong calls throughout this crisis because they have repeatedly refused to trust local communities to take decisions that work for their area. ""We have the local knowledge, the networks and the on-the-ground understanding and up-to-date information you need in a crisis – that's why government should give us the space we need to fight for local jobs."" A Conservative party spokesperson said: ""Throughout the pandemic British businesses have worked with our public services to help in the fight against coronavirus by delivering a wide variety of support, including PPE, hand sanitiser and ventilators. ""Yet at every turn throughout the pandemic, Labour have tried to play politics and score political points.""",Real Guardian,820.0
724,Real,The Guardian,"The government is exploring the idea of documentation that would allow travellers to prove they have been vaccinated against coronavirus, the Foreign Office minister James Cleverly has said. Boris Johnson's spokesperson had previously denied there were any plans for ""vaccine passports"" – but officials have now been asked to look at how people could comply with the requirements of some foreign governments for a vaccination before travel.  Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Cleverly said: ""It is often the case that the entry requirements for countries [include] vaccines and inoculations – that is not an uncommon practice. We will work with international partners to help facilitate their border arrangements and immigration requirements."" Greece is among the holiday hotspots that have suggested they would be willing to welcome tourists if they can show they have been inoculated. Government officials insisted the UK's proposals were at an early stage, and stressed that with strict lockdown rules still in place, travelling for a holiday was not currently allowed. Asked about the idea on Friday, the prime minister's spokesperson said: ""There are still no plans to roll out vaccine passports. At the moment, going on holiday is illegal – but we will keep the situation under review."" Arrivals from all countries to the UK currently have to quarantine for up to 10 days, and many in the government expect these rules to have to remain in place for an extended period, to avoid a resurgence in the virus just as the vaccination programme takes effect. Ministers have repeatedly declined to say whether they believe holidays abroad are likely to be possible this summer. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has told the public they can expect a ""great and free British summer"", disclosing that he has booked a stay in Cornwall. Denmark and Sweden are already working on plans for some form of digital certification for vaccination, and discussions are under way about an EU-wide certification scheme. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, backed the idea in January of using certificates to identify people who have had the jab, but added: ""Whether that gives a priority or access to certain goods, this is a political and legal decision that has to be discussed on the European level."" Some travel companies have already made vaccines compulsory. Saga requires its cruise passengers to have had both doses of the vaccine at least 14 days before departure.",Real Guardian,403.0
725,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson has said ""we truly did everything we could"" to minimise loss of life from coronavirus, and insisted he takes ""full responsibility"" for the government's handling of the pandemic. But when an inquiry is eventually carried out into the past 12 torrid months, the prime minister will have to face a series of difficult questions about key decisions he made.  As news first began to trickle out of China, triggering the government's pandemic planning, the prime minister left the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to chair the first five meetings of the emergency Cobra committee about the virus. After carrying out a fraught reshuffle of his cabinet, Johnson decamped to the taxpayer-owned mansion of Chevening, and did not chair his first Covid Cobra meeting until 2 March, just before the first confirmed UK death from the virus. Comforted by advisers who compared the challenge to tackling seasonal flu, he tended to play down the seriousness of the pandemic in its early days, insisting it was ""business as usual"". Most memorably, he told a Downing Street briefing that he ""shook hands with everybody"" during a hospital visit in early March. With the support of scientific advisers, Johnson took the decision to lift border restrictions on 13 March last year after evidence emerged that the virus was already circulating in the UK, despite a strict quarantine regime for arrivals from Wuhan, in China. At the time, the harsher approach adopted early on by countries such as Singapore and New Zealand, involving flight bans and quarantine, were regarded as extreme by ministers. But many analysts now believe closing the borders was an important precaution that helped these countries and others fare much better. Johnson announced a full-blown lockdown on 23 March last year, with little idea at the time that it would remain in place until July, with many children kept out of the classroom until September. He had edged towards the shutdown via a series of intermediate steps, including banning mass public events and exhorting the public to avoid unnecessary social interaction and to work from home where possible. Only when modelling carried out by Prof Neil Ferguson at Imperial College London suggested there could be up to 500,000 deaths if the virus was not brought under control, and amid growing signs that the public were taking matters into their own hands, did Johnson order the public to stay at home. Some public health experts now believe an earlier shutdown could have saved many thousands of lives. When it emerged that his top adviser had flouted lockdown rules by driving 300-plus miles to Durham, with a day trip to a local town thrown in, Johnson stuck by him resolutely. He told the public at a Downing Street press conference that his aide had acted ""responsibly and legally"", in crisscrossing the country, ostensibly to seek childcare for his young son, and then to test his eyesight, at a time when the public were being urged to stay at home. His decision sparked an avalanche of angry emails to MPs and risked undermining public confidence in lockdown rules at a critical time. The former TalkTalk executive Dido Harding was brought in by Johnson and Matt Hancock to run the hugely costly test-and-trace system, which has relied heavily on private sector outsourcing and has not worked as effectively as hoped. Councils carrying out their own local contact-tracing operations have generally obtained better results than the call centres run by Serco and other providers, while management consultants have in some cases been paid £7,000 a day for their expertise in setting it up. Johnson and his chancellor, Rishi Sunak, have declined to fix holes in the social safety net – including the paucity of statutory sick pay – that have created a strong financial disincentive for many people to self-isolate. Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance gave the prime minister a briefing on 16 September setting out the dire risks of allowing the virus to run unchecked as cases increased into the autumn. Their colleagues on the Sage committee suggested a short ""circuit-breaker"" lockdown, perhaps over the October half-term. But Downing Street aides made clear at the time that Johnson considered it to be his role to weigh up scientific advice with other considerations, including the economic and social costs of a fresh lockdown. He therefore opted for a middle course, between the scientists' proposal and the demands of many in his party to resist fresh restrictions: a beefed-up system of ""tiers"", with tougher rules for the hardest-hit areas. In the event, as Whitty predicted when they were introduced, even the strictest, tier 3 rules did not do enough to restrain the virus, and a month-long lockdown was announced on 31 October. A month before Christmas, the government agreed a plan with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland administrations that would allow up to three households to mix for a fixed five days over the festive period. Johnson then stuck resolutely by the plan, even as cases surged in London and Kent. Matt Hancock alerted the House of Commons to concerns about a new variant of the virus on 14 December, ""which may be associated with the faster spread in the south-east of England"".",Real Guardian,867.0
726,Real,The Guardian,"Downing Street has said it is up to Joe Biden how he decorates the Oval Office, after it was reported that a bust of Winston Churchill, lent by the UK government, has been removed. ""The Oval Office is the president's private office, and it's up to the president to decorate it as he wishes,"" Boris Johnson's official spokesman said, adding: ""We're in no doubt about the importance President Biden places on the UK-US relationship, and the prime minister looks forward to having that close relationship with him.""  Johnson's relaxed attitude is in marked contrast to his criticism of Barack Obama, when the former president moved the Churchill bust aside. Writing in the Sun in 2016, Johnson, then London mayor, and the author of a Churchill biography, called Obama's decision a ""snub,"" suggesting it may have been because of ""the part-Kenyan president's ancestral dislike of the British empire"". A bust of Mexican American labour rights leader Cesar Chavez was visible in pictures of Biden signing executive orders on Wednesday. The prime minister, who was referred to by Donald Trump when he was president as ""Britain Trump"", is keen to strike up a strong working relationship with the socially liberal Biden, who the government hopes will attend the G7 meeting in Cornwall in June. Johnson's spokesman was forced to field a string of questions about whether Johnson is ""woke"", after the shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, described Biden as a ""woke guy,"" referring to his support for Black Lives Matter and trans rights. Asked about her comments on Wednesday, Johnson appeared uncomfortable, before remarking that there was, ""nothing wrong with being woke"". When the prime minister's spokesman was asked whether Johnson would consider himself ""woke"", he said: ""You would have to define that, but you've got the PM's views on what he believes, and specifically on his agenda to level up across the country, and ensure that everybody has the opportunity to succeed."" The Conservatives believe publicly rejecting socially liberal policies such as the removal of historic statues with colonial connections will help them to score points over Labour. The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, has said he will legislate to prevent historic statues being removed, ""at the hand of the flash mob"" or by a ""cultural committee of town hall militants and woke worthies"". Johnson's remarks about Obama, made during the buildup to the Brexit referendum, caused a furore. It subsequently emerged that Obama had simply moved the bust of the wartime leader – a loan from the UK government – to a spot in his personal residence. When Theresa May rushed to Washington in early 2017 to be the first world leader to visit Trump in the White House, he swept her into the Oval Office to show that Churchill had been restored to prominence.",Real Guardian,465.0
727,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson cannot claim to be ""levelling up"" the UK if he persists with a planned cut in universal credit for 6 million families, an influential thinktank has said, as pressure mounts on the prime minister over the issue from within his own party. The Resolution Foundation joined opposition parties, anti-poverty campaigners and many Conservative MPs in urging the government to extend the £20-a-week uplift introduced during the first wave of the pandemic.  In its annual Living Standards Outlook report published on Monday, the foundation said the increase was critical in protecting the poorest households from the worst economic impacts of Covid in 2020, and warned refusing to extend it would contribute to a 730,000 increase in the number of children in poverty. Karl Handscomb, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""The living standards outlook for 2021 looks bleak at present – but the government can directly improve it."" ""Deciding if the £20 a week uplift to universal credit should be extended will determine whether millions of households are able to enjoy any sort of living standards recovery next year. And looking further ahead, the decision on whether to keep the UC boost will help define whether this is to be a parliament of 'levelling up' living standards, or pushing up poverty."" Conservative backbenchers representing 65 Northern seats, many of them ex-Labour ""red wall"" constituencies, have joined calls for the prime minister to cancel a planned reduction in the benefit. Carlisle MP John Stevenson of the Northern Research Group told the Guardian: ""While we are still in the pandemic, we've still got the consequences of coming through furlough – the implications of that – it would be far better to have a stable UC environment."" ""Levelling up is about improving people's lives, improving people's standard of living, giving people greater opportunities. You could argue that the UC uplift is helping people get lifted."" Labour has called an opposition day debate on the issue in the House of Commons on Monday, but Johnson has ordered his own MPs to boycott the vote rather than risk a significant rebellion. In an extraordinary message sent to Conservative MPs, the prime minister claimed that after a previous opposition day debate on free school meals, Labour had used its ""army of momentum trolls last time to misrepresent the outcome and to lie about its meaning and frankly to intimidate and threaten colleagues"". He suggested the government would continue refusing to take part in what he called ""vacuous opposition day debates"" until Labour stopped ""playing politics"" and ""inciting the worst kind of hatred and bullying"". What is universal credit? Universal credit (UC) is the supposed flagship reform of the benefits system, rolling together six benefits into one, online-only system. The theoretical aim, for which there was general support across the political spectrum, was to simplify the system and increase the incentives for people to move off benefits into work. With a huge influx due to the economic impact of the coronavirus, in September 2020 there were 5.6 million people claiming UC. How long has it been around? The project was legislated for in 2011 under the auspices of its most vocal champion, Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith. The plan was to roll it out by 2017. However, a series of management failures, expensive IT blunders and design faults mean it is now seven years behind schedule, and full rollout will not be complete until 2024. The government admitted that the delay was caused in part by claimants being too scared to sign up to the new benefit. What is the biggest problem? The original design set out a minimum 42-day wait for a first payment to claimants when they moved to UC (in practice this is often up to 60 days). After sustained pressure, the government announced in the autumn 2017 budget that the wait would be reduced to 35 days from February 2018. This will partially mitigate the impact on many claimants of having no income for six weeks. The wait has led to rent arrears and evictions, hunger (food banks in UC areas report notable increases in referrals), use of expensive credit and mental distress. Ministers have expanded the availability of hardship loans (now repayable over a year) to help new claimants while they wait for payment. Housing benefit will now continue for an extra two weeks after the start of a UC claim. However, critics say the five-week wait is still too long and want it reduced to two or three weeks. Are there other problems? Plenty. Multibillion-pound cuts to work allowances imposed by the former chancellor George Osborne mean UC is far less generous than originally envisaged. According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, about 2.5m low-income working households will be more than £1,000 a year worse off when they move to UC, reducing work incentives. Landlords are worried that the level of rent arrears accrued by tenants on UC could lead to a rise in evictions. It's also not very user-friendly: claimants complain the system is complex, unreliable and difficult to manage, particularly if you have no internet access. And there is concern that UC cannot deliver key promises: a critical study found it does not deliver savings, cannot prove it gets more people into work, and has plunged vulnerable claimants into hardship.",Real Guardian,882.0
728,Real,The Guardian,"Dealing with the deadly second wave of Covid has left the NHS in the most precarious position in its 72-year history, chief executive Sir Simon Stevens has warned, as ministers said they were aiming to get all adults in the UK vaccinated by September. The over-70s and clinically extremely vulnerable, who number more than 5.5 million nationwide, will be invited to receive the vaccine from Monday in areas where most of the first priority groups of care home residents and the over-80s have now had the jab.  Stevens said on Sunday that the NHS was now giving 140 jabs a minute, as the race to vaccinate the public picks up, but warned of the stress the service was under. Stevens said: ""The facts are very clear and I'm not going to sugar coat them. Hospitals are under extreme pressure and staff are under extreme pressure. ""Since Christmas Day we've seen another 15,000 increase in the inpatients in hospitals across England. That's the equivalent of filling 30 hospitals full of coronavirus patients and, staggeringly, every 30 seconds across England another patient is being admitted to hospital with coronavirus."" Asked by the BBC's Andrew Marr if the NHS had ever been in a more precarious position, he said: ""No. I think this is a unique event in our 72-year history. It's sort of become glib to talk about this as the worst pandemic in a century but that is clearly correct."" He also conceded that a ""small number"" of patients are having to be transferred from one region to another when beds are not available for them. However, Stevens also highlighted the rapid pace of the vaccination programme. Official figures published on Sunday showed that more than 3.8 million people have now received their first dose of a Covid vaccine in the UK. ""This is a huge team effort. This is bringing together the NHS, the St John's Ambulance volunteers, the Royal Voluntary Society, we are vaccinating not just in health centres and hospitals, but in village halls and rugby clubs and cathedrals and shopping centres and race courses, so everybody is coming together to get this done and I think we're off to a very strong start,"" he said. Ten mass vaccination centres will open from Monday at venues including St Helen's rugby ground, the Bournemouth International Centre and Taunton racecourse. Commenting on the expansion of the vaccine programme to new cohorts, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: ""Where an area has already reached the vast majority of groups one to two, they can now start opening up the programme to groups three to four. ""We are working day and night to make sure everyone who is 70 and over, our health and social care workers and the clinically extremely vulnerable are offered the vaccine by the middle of February, and our NHS heroes are making huge strides in making this happen."" The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said on Sunday that the government hoped to inoculate all adults by September, the first time the government has set a deadline. ""The plan is to get the first 15 million most vulnerable people vaccinated with the first dose by the middle of February,"" he told Marr. ""We then want to get, by early spring, another 17 million. At that point we'll have 99% of those most at risk of dying of coronavirus administered their first jab, and then the entire adult population we want being offered a first jab by September. That's the roadmap."" He added: ""Obviously if it can be done more swiftly than that, then that's a bonus."" In a separate interview with Sophy Ridge on Sky News, Raab was unable to guarantee that all of those who have already received a first dose of vaccine would get their second within the recommended 12-week timescale – though he said he was ""quietly confident"" it could be done. ""If we follow the roadmap and the supply chains … we ought to be able to deliver on that,"" he said. ""But right the way through this pandemic we've had to adapt to all sorts of different things. We're just focused on making sure we deliver on the roadmap we've got."" The government had already stretched the gap between the two doses on advice from the independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation to give protection to as many people as possible, as soon as possible. The latest data suggests that the lockdown has begun to turn the tide, with the number of new cases in the week to Sunday at 323,614, down 22.5% on the previous week. But with hospital admissions and deaths still extremely high, experts have stressed the importance of sticking to lockdown restrictions. Another 671 deaths were reported on Sunday to have taken place within 28 days of a positive test, and 4,179 people were admitted to hospitals with Covid.

Bailey is running against the Labour incumbent, Sadiq Khan, in May's election, which was delayed for a year by the Covid pandemic. A YouGov poll in November suggested Khan has a 21-point lead over his rival.  Bailey has already been criticised for a series of controversial comments, including suggesting homeless Londoners could save up a £5,000 deposit for a mortgage. Giving evidence to a House of Commons select committee in 2011, Bailey said: ""The key thing about poverty and poor people is that poverty is as much about mindset as it is about money. If you give poor people lots of money, they buy things, and not always what they need; they buy what they want."" The remarks were made when Bailey was an ambassador for David Cameron's 'big society' volunteering initiative. Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said: ""This is a disgusting attack on working class families, which reveals the true colours of the Conservative candidate for mayor of London"". In a 2005 pamphlet for the thinktank the Centre for Policy Studies, Bailey had previously claimed that ""a culture of dependency rules the working class"", and ""this liberal agenda hasn't benefited the working class. The working class look to rules. The rules are important to them. Take away the rules and they are left in limbo."" He was also criticised last week when he claimed in an interview with Inside Housing magazine that his plans for affordable housing would help homeless people trapped in temporary accommodation because they could save up the necessary £5,000 deposit and secure a mortgage. ""I don't think the £5,000 will [be a problem],"" he said. ""The mortgage application thing might be a bit tougher … they could save for it, yeah."" Pressed by the interviewer on whether he was suggesting a homeless family in bed and breakfast accommodation could afford a deposit, Bailey replied: ""Not all of them, but some people could. A full proportion of people could."" In response to Rayner's criticism of his 2011 comments, Bailey said: ""I grew up in a council house. I was raised by a single mum. I've been poor and I've been homeless. I'm proud of my working-class roots. ""The only attack is coming from City Hall, where Sadiq Khan is raising council tax on working-class families by 10%.

He also urged them to help with organising direct support in communities, such as food banks; campaign for a green new deal; and press the government to speed up the delivery of Covid vaccines in developing countries.  ""So many of the ideas we need to make the 2020s better than the 2010s were developed in and around the Labour party in recent years, by outstanding thinkers, but more importantly by demands of our movements, and the skills, knowledge and needs of the communities affected,"" Corbyn said. ""We will build on these policies, taking them further, adapting them to the post-pandemic world, so that our movement can turn the dial towards peace and justice."" Corbyn was readmitted to the Labour party in November, after being suspended over remarks he made when the Equality and Human Rights Commission published its critical report on the party's handling of antisemitism. But his successor as leader, Keir Starmer, declined to restore the Labour whip to Corbyn, who now sits as an independent MP. The broadcasting regulator, Ofcom, gave the go-ahead last month to Murdoch's right-leaning news channel, which is expected to be on air for four to five hours a night. It is expected to compete with Andrew Neil's GB News, with the pair racing to be the first on air. Corbyn repeatedly criticised the role of the media in public life during his time as leader of the opposition. He was ridiculed in some of Murdoch's newspapers, with the Sun's front page on election day in 2017 urging its readers: ""Don't chuck Britain in the Cor-bin."" Corbyn gave a lecture at the Edinburgh television festival in 2018 calling for a taxpayer-owned British Digital Corporation to offset the power of multinational corporations in the media, though the policy never found its way into Labour's manifesto. His digital rally also featured Greece's former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis and the Labour MP for Coventry South, Zarah Sultana. The new initiative will not be signing up members but Corbyn hopes to play a convening role in bringing together activists, trade unions and other leftwing groups.

""It won't be a big bang, it will be done phased, possibly back through the tiered approach that we had before."" In an interview with Sophy Ridge on Sky News, Raab was unable to guarantee that all of those who have already received a first dose of vaccine would get their second within the recommended 12-week timescale – though he said he was ""quietly confident"" it could be done. ""If we follow the roadmap and the supply chains … we ought to be able to deliver on that,"" he said. ""But right the way through this pandemic we've had to adapt to all sorts of different things. We're just focused on making sure we deliver on the roadmap we've got."" The government had already stretched the gap between the two doses, on advice from the independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, in order to give protection to as many people as possible, as soon as possible. Ten new mass vaccination centres are expected to open on Monday as the programme steps up, in locations including Bournemouth, Blackburn and Slough. Sir Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, underlined the speed of the vaccine rollout on Sunday, telling Marr that ""140 jabs a minute"" were being delivered. Official data showed that by Saturday, 3.5m doses of the Covid vaccines had been delivered, with 424,327 of those being second doses. Stevens said that meant the NHS was ""vaccinating four times faster than people are newly catching coronavirus"". However, he also highlighted the strain the NHS was under. Asked by Marr whether the health service had ever been in a more precarious position, he said: ""No."" ""Hospitals are under extreme pressure and staff are under extreme pressure,"" he said. ""Since Christmas Day we've seen another 15,000 increase in the inpatients in hospitals across England. That's the equivalent of filling 30 hospitals full of coronavirus patients and, staggeringly, every 30 seconds across England another patient is being admitted to hospital with coronavirus.""",Real Guardian,557.0
732,Real,The Guardian,"Labour will force a House of Commons vote on the looming £20-a-week cut to universal credit in an attempt to increase the pressure on the government to cancel it. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, increased two key benefits, universal credit and the basic element of working tax credit, by £20 a week during the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic last spring.  The uplift was only expected to last 12 months, but charities and anti-poverty campaigners have urged the government not to go ahead with cutting the benefits while the virus is still raging. Boris Johnson appeared to hint that he was minded to go ahead with the reduction on Wednesday. When asked about the issue at the cross-party liaison committee of senior MPs, he said: ""I think that what we want to see is jobs, we want people in employment and we want to see the economy bouncing back. ""And I think most people in this country want to see a focus on jobs and growth in wages than on welfare, but clearly we have to keep all of these things under review."" Labour has been granted two opposition day debates on Monday, and has said it will use them to hold votes on the benefit cut and on free school meals provision. Votes on opposition day debates are non-binding but can cause embarrassment for the government. The shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said: ""Under the Conservatives, families come last. The government's mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic means Britain is facing one of the worst recessions of any major economy. Boris Johnson's decision to cut universal credit will hit millions of families who are already struggling to get by. ""There cannot be another repeat of the government's indecision and mismanagement of the free school meals scandal. The government must put families first during this lockdown and act now instead of waiting until the last minute. If ministers refuse, Conservative MPs have the opportunity to vote with Labour and give families the support they need to get through this pandemic."" A recent report by the Resolution Foundation thinktank found that more than a third of the UK's poorest families had their already meagre incomes squeezed during the pandemic because they had had to spend more on food, energy and home schooling. The chancellor is due to deliver his budget on 3 March. He has stressed the need for ""hard choices"" to deal with the dramatic deterioration in public finances as a result of the pandemic.",Real Guardian,417.0
733,Real,The Guardian,"Labour is to launch a programme to educate its 500,000 members about the history of the Good Friday agreement and the party's role in delivering peace to Northern Ireland while in government. Louise Haigh, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, said that since taking on her position last year she had learned more about the aftermath of the decades-long conflict, which was brought to an end by the historic deal, ratified by referendums in Northern Ireland and the Republic, and signed in 1998.  ""It's not taught well enough in schools, given that it was within the UK, it was four decades of conflict brought to an end, and is a peace process that is held up around the world as a model,"" she added. The Agreement set the political framework for the power-sharing executive that governs Northern Ireland today, and tackled a string of other fraught political and social issues. ""When the British government got in the helicopters and flew away from Stormont, that wasn't that, it took nine more years to get the institutions back up and running,"" Haigh said. ""The peace process still continues, and there is still so much left to do to implement the Good Friday agreement. And that's the biggest lesson that I've learned since taking on this role, about how much, 23 years on, is still left unfulfilled."" Labour has produced educational material, including videos, for its members to highlight the history of the agreement, celebrating the role of the last Labour government and key figures such as the Northern Ireland secretary Mo Mowlam. ""We want to highlight Labour's special role in delivering that, and the unwavering commitment of Tony Blair to securing and protecting the peace through the entirety of the last Labour government,"" Haigh said. ""I think that's an important story to tell."" Under Sir Keir Starmer, Labour has been notably keener on hailing the achievements of the Blair government than during Jeremy Corbyn's leadership when Blair was mainly remembered as the instigator of the UK's military involvement in Iraq. Labour will hold four online seminars to teach members the history of the Good Friday agreement and its legacy. One of these will involve Avila Kilmurray and Monica McWilliams, members of the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition, who were actively involved in the talks. Haigh called the women's involvement ""part of the untold story of peace,"" adding: ""I think there's a lot for us to learn here in our kind of fractured politics, about what can be achieved when we bring communities together and we recognise what we have in common."" She accused the Tory government of neglecting Northern Ireland, citing as an example ministers' threat to tear up the Northern Ireland protocol, the section of the Brexit agreement governing trade between Northern Ireland, the Republic and Great Britain. Boris Johnson, the prime minister, insisted on Wednesday that trade had been running smoothly since the Brexit transition period ended at the end of December. But Haigh said the government was failing to acknowledge the scale of the problems facing some companies. ""A lot of the delay is completely avoidable and it was because of the government's totally shambolic preparations and attitudes to the negotiations and to the protocol,"" she said. ""Some businesses, for example those delivering parcels between Britain and Northern Ireland, only received their guidance 12 hours before the transition period ended. And so it's no surprise that we're seeing these delays and disruption. And we need to see the government getting their heads out of the sand.""",Real Guardian,586.0
734,Real,The Guardian,"The government is preparing to ban travellers from Brazil in an effort to limit the cases of a new Covid variant reaching the UK, with an announcement expected on Thursday. Boris Johnson dropped a heavy hint that travel restrictions could be imposed, as he was pressed by Labour MP Yvette Cooper at a cross-party liaison committee.  Cooper asked why the government had not stopped travel from Brazil, given the risks of the newly identified variant of the disease. ""You were warned about the Brazil variant three days ago. We don't know, yet, whether that variant could undermine the vaccination programme. Why aren't you taking immediate action, on a precautionary basis?"" Cooper asked. The prime minister replied: ""We are: we're putting in extra measures to ensure that people coming from Brazil are checked: and indeed stopping people coming from Brazil."" Brazil had already banned direct flights from the UK on Christmas Day, amid concerns about the Kent variant of the virus. But ministers are understood to be considering halting flights from neighbouring countries as a precaution, to prevent travellers from Brazil arriving indirectly. It is understood the government's expert committee on new and emerging viruses, Nervtag, considered the implications of the Brazilian variant on Tuesday. A decision on a travel ban is likely to be announced after a meeting of the ministerial Covid-O committee on Thursday – and could also include neighbouring countries. It is not yet known whether the Brazilian variant is more transmissible than previous iterations of the disease – or whether it could be vaccine resistant. Asked by Cooper whether he was contemplating a flights ban, Johnson repeatedly said the government was ""taking steps"". ""We're taking steps to stop the Brazil variant, as we've taken steps to stop the South African variant being imported into this country, as indeed the French took steps to prevent the Kent variant being imported into France: that's what countries do,"" he said. Flights from South Africa were banned before Christmas, after a new variant of the disease was identified there. Cooper pointed to evidence showing that the virus had reached Europe from China via a series of routes early in the pandemic, not simply through direct flights. ""It's nearly four weeks since we were warned about the South African variant, but if I wanted to travel from South Africa here today, I could get a flight via Dubai or Istanbul, with no test before I left, no test during, no test on arrival; go straight on to the tube from Heathrow, and then on to a train and travel home across the country,"" she said. The prime minister highlighted that negative Covid tests would be required to enter England from Friday, but also pointed to the need for what he called a ""balanced approach"". ""The reason that we've wanted to have a balanced approach in our border policy is obviously that you need to make sure that you're balancing the threat to health with the threat to the economy,"" he said. This story was amended on 14 January 2021 to clarify that the UK government was considering a ban on travellers from Brazil rather than flights.",Real Guardian,525.0
735,Real,The Guardian,"Once again, Marcus Rashford has scored against the government, after Boris Johnson was forced to admit at prime minister's questions that food parcels being sent to England's poorest families were ""appalling"" and ""an insult"". Keir Starmer attacked the prime minister for trying to dodge the blame, pointing out that the stingy-looking packages – pictures of which had been shared by Rashford, and by furious parents, on social media – appeared to reflect government guidance.  But Johnson's abject apology, which followed a hastily arranged phone call with the footballer, did mark a change of approach from last year. No 10 had initially sought to brush off Rashford's calls for free school meals provision to continue throughout the 2020 summer break, before changing its mind and setting up a voucher scheme. Then in the autumn, the government again resisted a holiday voucher scheme – one backbencher, Brendan Clarke-Smith, even warned against ""nationalising children"" – before ministers caved in. This time, the Department for Education had dropped its ""food parcel first"" guidance by Wednesday afternoon, allowing families to use vouchers if they prefer, once the scheme is set up. Conservative insiders say the children's minister, Vicky Ford, was involved in pushing for a swift response on the issue. And Johnson's language suggested the Downing Street machine has learned a tangle with Rashford only has one outcome. But some of Johnson's backbench troops despair that No 10 continues to be outflanked by the footballer – something they see as part of a pattern of flat-footed political management. On a call with Boris Johnson's press secretary, Allegra Stratton, on Tuesday, backbench Conservative MPs complained that No 10 remained too slow at rebuttals – and too vulnerable to elephant traps set by Labour. Throughout the pandemic, Starmer has repeatedly stolen a march on Johnson by pushing for moves the government's scientific advisers have demanded. In a pattern that has become wearily familiar, Johnson instinctively hits back, before giving way to the inevitable a few days or weeks later. The clearest recent example was the prime minister's attack on Starmer on 16 December for wanting to ""cancel Christmas"", delivered in a tone of injured indignation, before Johnson announced last-minute changes to the festive mixing rules three days later. This about-turn, and the more recent one on schools reopening, came more than a month after Stratton's arrival and the departure of Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain, who were often blamed for Johnson's pugnacious style. There have been modest signs in recent weeks that the prime minister is picking fewer fights, and trying to restrain his irrepressible boosterism – urging caution about when the lockdown can be lifted, for example. But it is unclear as yet whether that is the result of a fresh approach to communications or the severity of the current phase of the pandemic. And no amount of fancy political footwork will help if the government is failing the public, in the way a slick campaign such as Rashford's can relentlessly expose. Ultimately, the reason the government continues to be caught out over child food poverty is a more fundamental one: the fact that the threadbare social safety net means children are going hungry in the first place. Once housing costs are taken into account, the incomes of the poorest families were falling even before the pandemic hit. As the Joseph Rowntree Foundation says in its annual report on poverty on Wednesday, the squeeze on incomes was happening predominantly as the result of deliberate political decisions taken by Conservative governments to reduce the welfare bill – in particular, the 2016-20 benefits freeze. Rishi Sunak increased universal credit by £20 a week early in the pandemic, in an implicit admission that the payments had become too paltry to live on. The chancellor has not yet said whether that will remain in place from April, choosing instead in a recent Spectator interview to highlight the necessity of ""hard choices"" to tackle the deficit. With Rashford already on the warpath, extending the £20 a week increase looks all but inevitable; but the government will continue to remain vulnerable to the campaigning footballer's attacks as long as there are parents in 21st-century Britain who cannot afford to feed their kids.",Real Guardian,701.0
736,Real,The Guardian,"Lockdown appears to have delayed Downing Street's plans for daily televised press briefings featuring Boris Johnson's new press secretary, Allegra Stratton, with No 10 saying its communications strategy is under review. The new White House-style briefings were due to start on Monday in a specially refurbished studio in Downing Street. But in a telephone briefing with journalists on Wednesday, Stratton said the government was taking a fresh look at its approach in light of the changing circumstances.  ""We are looking closely at the best communication for the period we now find ourselves in,"" she said. ""We have a new strain of coronavirus that's 50% more infectious; the prime minister's taken the steps he's taken in the last few days, and we are considering the best way to support this and to get across public health messaging."" Stratton suggested there would be more press conferences featuring ministers and public health experts, like those during the spring 2020 lockdown. ""We're actively looking at the best format,"" she said, adding that an announcement would be made shortly about the government's plans. The idea of daily televised briefings, with a senior broadcaster acting as the voice of the government, was the brainchild of Johnson's former senior adviser Lee Cain. But Cain disagreed with Johnson's choice of Stratton to front them, and subsequently left government, as did his former Vote Leave colleague Dominic Cummings. The daily briefings were intended to take place with a live audience of political journalists, who could ask questions of Stratton directly, but lockdown rules mean that would not now be possible. Since late March last year, journalists have contributed questions via video link at Johnson's Downing Street press briefings.

737,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson has promised MPs that schools will be first to reopen when the lockdown is lifted – but stressed he would be ""extremely cautious"" about when that can happen. The Commons has been recalled to discuss the regulations needed to reimpose the England-wide lockdown announced by the prime minister on Monday.  Addressing MPs on Wednesday, Johnson defended his last-minute decision to close schools, after pupils in many parts of the country returned for a day, saying he had been battling to keep schools open. ""Schools were the very last thing to close, as I'd always promised that they would be,"" he said, adding: ""When we begin to move out of lockdown, I promise that they will be the very first things to reopen."" ""That moment may come after the February half-term, although we should remain extremely cautious about the timetable ahead."" The prime minister also sounded a warning to businesses in sectors such as hospitality keen to know when they can reopen, saying the new regulations do not expire until the end of March, because unwinding the lockdown would be a gradual process. ""As was the case last spring, our emergence from the lockdown will not be a big bang but a gradual unravelling,"" he said. He defended the government's handling of the pandemic in recent weeks, claiming the approach of tiered restrictions across England was working until the new variant of Covid became widespread. ""The tiers which the house agreed last month were working with the old variant,"" he said, adding: ""It is inescapable that the facts are changing and we must change our response. We have no choice."" He added: ""The data showed that our efforts to contain the spread of new variant would not be sufficient if schools continued to act as a potential vector for spreading the virus between households."" Johnson sought to highlight the potential for rapid delivery of the Covid vaccine as the way out of the crisis, calling it a ""sprint"", compared with the ""marathon"" of last year's lockdown. He reiterated that ""by 15 February the NHS is committed to offering a vaccine to everyone in the top four priority groups"". That includes all over-70s, care home workers and frontline NHS workers. ""In working towards that target, there are already more than 1,000 vaccination centres across the country,"" he said. The prime minister said that from next week there would be seven large-scale new vaccination centres in venues such as sports stadiums and exhibition spaces. He said the UK had already vaccinated 1.3 million people, saying that was more than in the rest of Europe combined, and promised a daily update on the number of people receiving the jab. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said his party would support the lockdown measures but criticised the speed of Johnson's response. ""Tougher restrictions are necessary,"" he said. ""We will support them, and vote for them, and urge everybody to comply with the new rules – stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives."" But Starmer said the lockdown was ""not inevitable"", but ""part of a pattern"", saying the government had been too slow to act throughout the crisis: including failing to heed an official report in the summer called ""preparing for a challenging winter"", which warned of the risk of the virus mutating and the NHS being overwhelmed during the winter. During the debate, few Conservative MPs challenged the necessity of the lockdown outright. Graham Brady, the chair of the backbench 1922 Committee, called for the Commons to be given more opportunities to vote on the regulations, at the end of January and February. The MP for New Forest West, Desmond Swayne, highlighted anomalies in the regulations, saying they were ""pervaded by a pettifogging malice"". Johnson replied, ""pettifogging yes, malicious, no"". The former health secretary Jeremy Hunt asked about the result of studies on whether Covid vaccines were effective against the new variants.

738,Real,The Guardian,"Three Labour MPs have resigned as junior frontbenchers after defying Keir Starmer and refusing to vote for Boris Johnson's Brexit deal. Within hours of the agreement being clinched on Christmas Eve, Starmer announced he would whip his party to support it, despite criticising the substance of the deal as ""thin"".  But some Labour MPs felt uncomfortable supporting a deal they believed would damage the economy, and feared it would be difficult to criticise the deal if the party backed it. Tonia Antoniazzi, the MP for Gower, Helen Hayes, the Dulwich and West Norwood MP, and Florence Eshalomi, the MP for Vauxhall, resigned from their junior frontbench posts so as to abstain as MPs voted on the legislation implementing the agreement. In a statement on her website, Hayes, who was a shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: ""This is a bad deal which will make our country poorer. It will cost jobs, undermine our security, weaken our standing in the world, risk workers' rights and environmental protections, and limit opportunities for our children and grandchildren."" In total, 36 Labour MPs abstained in the vote, including staunch campaigners against Brexit such as Stella Creasy and Neil Coyle, and leftwingers such as Rebecca Long-Bailey and Diane Abbott. Just one Labour MP, Bell Ribeiro-Addy, the MP for Streatham, went further and voted against the deal. During the debate on Wednesday, Starmer made the point forcefully that to vote against the deal would be to countenance a no-deal exit from the Brexit transition period. He said: ""The choice before the house today is perfectly simple. Do we implement the treaty that has been agreed with the EU, or do we not? If we choose not to, the outcome is clear: we leave the transition period without a deal. Without a deal on security, on trade, on fisheries. Without protection for our manufacturing sector, for farming, for countless businesses. And without a foothold to build a future relationship with the EU."" Several senior Labour MPs, including the Brexit committee chair, Hilary Benn, spoke in support of Starmer's position, despite their reservations about Johnson's deal. But others including Clive Lewis, Diane Abbott and Kevin Brennan said they could not follow Starmer's lead and vote for the legislation, which was being rushed through both houses of parliament in a single day. Brennan rejected Starmer's characterisation of the vote as deal versus no deal. ""While I understand the desire to move on I simply don't understand why it's necessary for those who believe this is a bad deal to vote for it, and dip their fingertips in this abject failure of national ambition,"" he said. Lewis lambasted the lack of parliamentary scrutiny of the agreement, saying: ""Does the restoration of sovereignty not extend to democratic oversight by elected members of this house?"" He called it ""false framing, used to hold this house to ransom"" to suggest that opposition to it would mean accepting no deal. ""Let's be clear about what's being asked for this house today: that's for a blank cheque to be issued to this government to implement a deal that is devoid of democratic oversight,"" he said. Creasy said in a statement on her website: ""Whatever Labour does, the Conservatives will cry foul, suggesting any attempt to scrutinise the deal after it is passed reveals a true intention to fight Brexit. The road ahead will be rocky for all concerned. To abstain is not to refuse to be part of that fight but to refuse to do so on the prime minister's terms."" Jeremy Corbyn, Labour's former leader, also declined to support the deal. ""I cannot vote for this deal, which this government will use to drive down rights and protections, and step up the sell-off of our vital public services. We need instead to break with failed race-to-the-bottom policies and build a Britain that puts people before private profit,"" he tweeted. Corbyn is now sitting as an independent after the whip was withdrawn over comments questioning the scale of the antisemitism problem in Labour under his leadership. Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, said Starmer's insistence that voting against the deal meant backing a no-deal Brexit was ludicrous. ""Whatever the opposition parties do, this government has a majority of 80 and this deal will pass,"" she said. ""Now more than ever, people deserve principled leadership based on conviction, not party political calculation."" She said she was not willing to acquiesce on a deal that ""cuts British jobs, sidelines our services sector, undermines hard-won protections for the environment, workers' rights and consumers, and turns Kent into a diesel-stained monument to hubris and political myopia"".",Real Guardian,767.0
739,Real,The Guardian,"Keir Starmer will whip Labour MPs to support Boris Johnson's Brexit deal when it comes to parliament next week, he has announced, in a move likely to provoke a rebellion by pro-EU backbenchers. The Labour leader gave a press conference after the prime minister announced that negotiations had concluded, and said he had made the ""tough decision"" to back the agreement. ""When this deal comes before parliament, Labour will accept it, and vote for it,"" he said.  Starmer described Johnson's deal as ""thin"", saying it would not underpin workers' rights or adequately protect sectors such as manufacturing and the creative industries. But he insisted that a no-deal exit from the transition period on 1 January next week was now the only other realistic possibility. ""A better deal could have been negotiated. But I accept that option has now gone,"" he said. Some Labour MPs had urged Starmer to abstain in the vote on the deal, saying he would be unable to hold the government to account for its economic consequences if Labour had supported it. Others, including some of those who refused to vote to trigger the article 50 process of leaving the EU, would like Labour to vote against. Several shadow cabinet members – including the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Bridget Phillipson, and the shadow international trade secretary, Emily Thornberry – are known to have expressed concerns about the idea of supporting the deal, though they are expected to abide by collective responsibility. Dodds tweeted on Thursday that the agreement would have a ""major negative impact"" on GDP and pointed out that it would not have the ""exact same benefits"" as EU membership – a promise that Starmer included as one of his ""six tests"" of Theresa May's deal when he was the shadow Brexit secretary. But Starmer insisted that ""leadership is about taking the tough decisions in the national interest"", adding: ""It is about being a serious, responsible opposition. At a moment of such national significance, it is not credible for Labour to be on the sidelines."" Johnson attacked Starmer at prime minister's questions this month when he abstained in a key vote on coronavirus restrictions. He said his message to the government was: ""Up against no deal, we accept this deal, but the consequences of it are yours. And yours alone. We will hold you to account for it every second you are in power."" The decision was confirmed in a shadow cabinet meeting on Thursday. Both Houses of Parliament will be recalled on 30 December, with the Commons sitting from 9.30am and the Lords from noon, to push through a bill implementing the deal – potentially in a single day. The Speaker of the House of Commons, Lindsay Hoyle, has urged MPs and their staff to avoid travelling if possible, given the Covid restrictions in place in many parts of the country and the prevalence of the disease in London. With Labour's support, even a significant rebellion by Eurosceptic MPs on the Tory benches – which appears unlikely – will not prevent the deal from passing. But Starmer may face a significant rebellion on his own side, with some Labour MPs suggesting scores of colleagues could defy the whips, who will be unable to use the traditional approach of face-to-face persuasion to win them over.

740,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson claimed finally to have settled the vexed question of Britain's relationship with the European Union as he hailed on Christmas Eve what he called the ""jumbo, Canada-style"" Brexit deal. At a press conference in Downing Street where he was flanked by two large union flags, the UK's prime minister said: ""This European question's been going on for decades. I think this gives us the platform, the foundation for a really prosperous new relationship.""  He claimed the deal, which will see Great Britain leave the customs union and single market but retain tariff-free access to EU markets, would create a ""giant free-trade zone"" characterised by ""regulatory competition"". The two sides have agreed an independent arbitration process to judge what penalties should be applied if either deviates from current regulatory standards in a way that undercuts the other. Johnson insisted: ""We have taken back control of laws and our destiny. We have taken back control of every jot and tittle of our regulation in a way that is complete and unfettered."" He highlighted what he claimed would be the UK's newfound ability to ""set our own standards, to innovate in the way that we want"" in key sectors such as biosciences and artificial intelligence. ""British laws will be made solely by the British parliament; interpreted by British judges, sitting in the UK courts,"" he said. Johnson also stressed the ""prodigious"" increase in fishing catches he said the UK would now be allowed to keep. Despite the fact exporters will now face increased friction at the border, he claimed he had struck ""a deal which will if anything allow our companies and our exporters to do even more business with our European friends"". His optimism contrasts with the expectations of the government's own independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, which expects Brexit to shave 4% off GDP in the medium term. The fishing industry was also disappointed that Johnson had not secured control of the 12 miles of fishing waters off the coast of Britain. Barrie Deas, head of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, said: ""I think what I would say is that there's a gap between the rhetoric and the delivery … I think the industry will be bitterly disappointed. I think there will be fury about the failure to secure an exclusive 12-mile zone."" Most of Johnson's themes in his speech, including sovereignty, regulatory independence and fishing, were those close to the hearts of the Brexit-backing MPs who helped him to win the Tory leadership last year. With MPs set to vote on the agreement on Wednesday 30 December, Downing Street has kept Eurosceptic backbenchers closely informed as negotiations developed.

The prime minister urged Brexiters and remainers to move on from the divisions that have plagued UK politics since the referendum. ""My message to everybody on both sides of that argument in 2016 is I really think now it's a long time behind us,"" he said.

741,Real,The Guardian,"Boris Johnson has issued a new ""stay at home"" order covering London and much of the south and east of England, and dramatically curtailed plans for Christmas mixing nationwide, in response to a new fast-spreading strain of coronavirus. Just days after reaffirming the festive ""bubble"" plan and claiming it would be ""inhuman"" to cancel Christmas, the prime minister announced the creation of a new, stricter ""tier 4"".  Only households living outside this area will now be allowed to mix for Christmas in England – and then only for a single day, 25 December, with long-distance travel discouraged. ""It is with a very heavy heart that I must tell you we cannot continue with Christmas as planned,"" the prime minister said, insisting there was no alternative. ""I know how much emotion people invest in this time of year, and how important it is, for instance for grandparents to see their grandchildren, for families to be together,"" he said. ""We have said throughout this pandemic that we must and we will be guided by the science. When the science changes, we must change our response."" The Scottish and Welsh governments have been briefed on the situation and have announced their own plans. The new tier 4 rules will come into effect at midnight, and will be similar to those in place during the four-week lockdown in November. Non-essential retail, leisure venues and close-contact services such as hairdressers will not be allowed to reopen after they close on Saturday. Members of the public will be ordered to stay at home, aside from a few exemptions such as taking exercise. The only mixing with other households allowed in tier 4 will be meeting up with a single other person outdoors. The area affected includes all of London and much of the south and east of England, including Kent, most of Essex, most of Surrey, as well Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Hertfordshire, parts of Bedfordshire, Gosport, Portsmouth and Peterborough. The prime minister said travel was not recommended anywhere in England. ""We're asking everyone, in all tiers, to stay local,"" he said. The restrictions were announced by the prime minister at a hastily convened press conference on Saturday, alongside the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and the chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance. They will initially be in place for a fortnight. Asked whether existing guidance such as the 2-metre distancing rule may need to be changed, Whitty said the same measures would still be effective, but, ""we're going to have to do a lot more to stand still"". Johnson announced the draconian new restrictions after being presented with evidence on Friday night that the new strain of coronavirus recently identified in the capital and in Kent is spreading more rapidly than the previous strain. Johnson said the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) had estimated that the new variant may be up to 70% more transmissable. Scientists do not yet have evidence that the new variant has a higher mortality rate, or that it affects the effectiveness of vaccines or treatments for Covid. But the government's scientific advisers have become increasingly alarmed about evidence and modelling suggesting it is spreading very rapidly. In particular, there were concerns that the prevalence of the virus had not been falling in Kent, despite the county being under tier 3 restrictions. The weekly average case rate for England has increased by more than 66% in the past fortnight, and in London it has nearly doubled in the past week. The new variant is accounting for 60% of infections in London. The plans were confirmed in a cabinet call on Saturday afternoon, and the prime minister also spoke to the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, to discuss them. Just three days ago, Johnson taunted Starmer with wanting to ""cancel Christmas"", as he insisted the government would be sticking with looser regulations allowing up to three families to mix for up to five days. Instead of changing the rules, the prime minister had exhorted the public to be cautious, saying, ""a smaller Christmas is going to be a safer Christmas, and shorter Christmas is a safer Christmas"". The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said the announcement was a ""bitter blow for Londoners who were hoping to spend time safely with loved ones this Christmas"". He called on the government to ""vastly increase mass testing,"" and to increase financial support to business and the self-employed hit by the restrictions.",Real Guardian,738.0
742,Real,The Guardian,"When Boris Johnson's cabinet met by video link on Halloween weekend, as he rushed forward plans to announce an England-wide lockdown after they emerged in the press, Gavin Williamson gave colleagues a ticking off about leaks. The irony of Williamson's lecture was not lost on others present. It was the education secretary who less than 18 months earlier had been sacked by Theresa May over the leak of sensitive discussions about the Chinese tech giant Huawei.  Williamson protested his innocence; but in any case, when Johnson won the leadership he wiped the slate clean. Leaking from May's deeply divided cabinet became so endemic that one minister said they learned to spot when a colleague made a particularly wordy intervention that appeared designed to find its way into the press. Ministers on either side of the Brexit divide were keen to ensure that whatever the outcome of cabinet discussions, their contribution to the argument was recorded for posterity. The then chief whip, Julian Smith – responsible for party discipline – later gave a BBC interview saying May's cabinet had been the ""the worst example of ill-discipline in cabinet in British political history"". The Johnson regime was meant to be different: when he wrote the foreword to a reworked ministerial code last August, he promised there would be ""no leaking; no breach of collective responsibility"". And his aides Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain went about enforcing that diktat with zeal. They banned special advisers from accepting hospitality from journalists – with some reports even suggesting Cummings had a network of ""spies"" in popular Westminster bars and restaurants to spot who was lunching whom. Those accused of leaking were sometimes treated brutally – Sajid Javid's aide Sonia Khan was summarily sacked by Cummings and marched out of Downing Street by police. Last month, the government paid between £50,000 and £100,000 to Khan to settle her claim of unfair dismissal, shortly before a five-day hearing for the case was due to begin. A former special adviser to Grant Shapps, Neil Tweedie, recently claimed in the Mail on Sunday that Cain had warned him, after a spate of well-informed stories about changes to travel restrictions appeared, that ""if leaks carry on, we'll start shooting people"". Tweedie, who denied he was the source of the leaks, was later fired. He was then rehired, after Cummings and Cain were forced out in what insiders say was a power-struggle with Johnson's partner, Carrie Symonds, and the new Downing Street press secretary, Allegra Stratton. It remains to be seen whether this new No 10 regime will be more successful in stopping Tory tongues wagging. But they may find that like backbench rebellion, which has proved impossible to quell despite Johnson's safe majority, leaking is a tough habit to break. Meanwhile, the House of Commons Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, has repeatedly asked for updates on No 10's investigation into the lockdown leak – but nothing has so far emerged.",Real Guardian,489.0
743,Real,The Guardian,"Leftwing Labour MPs, union leaders and activists have accused Keir Starmer of ""undermining party democracy"" and urged him to restore the whip to Jeremy Corbyn and to lift the ban on local parties discussing the case. In a strongly worded statement, many of Corbyn's most high-profile Labour allies called on Starmer not to ""demoralise and undermine"" the party's membership ahead of crucial local elections next year.  ""Members must be treated with respect, including by upholding the basic democratic right that local party members can decide what they discuss and the positions our local parties take, as well as by ensuring that meetings are always open, inclusive and free from discrimination,"" the statement says. ""We call on the Labour leadership to reinstate the whip to Jeremy Corbyn, end the attacks on party democracy, legitimate discussion and recent wave of suspensions, and instead to focus on taking the fight to the Tories."" Signatories include union leaders Len McCluskey of Unite, Manuel Cortes of the TSSA, and Dave Ward of the CWU, as well as 18 MPs including John McDonnell, Richard Burgon and Diane Abbott. Six members of the party's ruling national executive committee (NEC) also signed. Their intervention underlines the continued divisions in Labour a year after the catastrophic result in the 2019 general election. Starmer decided not to reinstate Corbyn to the parliamentary party after his suspension from Labour membership ended last month, saying his predecessor's actions had ""undermined and set back our work in restoring trust and confidence in the Labour party's ability to tackle antisemitism"". Labour HQ has since ordered constituency parties not to pass motions of solidarity with Corbyn, or criticise the findings of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) into Labour's handling of antisemitism. A Labour source said: ""CLPs [constituency Labour parties] have received guidance on conducting discussions of the EHRC report and its impact in a constructive and inclusive way that recognises that its recommendations result from a statutory investigation and that the party has accepted it in full."" Corbyn's supporters have also highlighted a number of recent suspensions of Labour members, including Liverpool Walton CLP secretary Alan Gibbons, which they regard as motivated by factionalism. A Labour spokesperson declined to comment on the Gibbons case, but it is understood he is suspended pending investigation. Corbyn's leadership saw an influx of new members into Labour, many from other parties or from outside party politics, and some of his supporters suspect Starmer of wanting to push them out, though he has repeatedly underlined his commitment to Labour unity. Few members of Corbyn's top team remained on the party's frontbench after Starmer conducted a drastic reshuffle when he took over the leadership. Rebecca Long-Bailey, who stood against Starmer as the leftwing candidate, was subsequently sacked as shadow education secretary for sharing an interview that included an antisemitic trope. Corbyn was suspended in the light of a statement he made after Labour was condemned by the EHRC for its handling of antisemitism complaints. The former leader accepted that antisemitism in Labour had been a problem, and action to tackle it had been too slow – but insisted the scale of it had been ""dramatically overstated for political reasons"". His allies believed they had secured agreement from Starmer's office that he would be readmitted to the party, drawing a line under the matter. A Labour spokesperson declined to comment on Gibbons's suspension, which colleagues believe is in connection with a motion passed at the CLP that may have breached the rules. Gibbons has said he only joined Labour after Corbyn became leader. Writing in the Tribune, he urged fellow ""socialists"" to ""stay, organise and fight"". Dan Carden, the local MP, tweeted: ""Suspending members without explanation is no way to treat people who give everything to our party.""",Real Guardian,629.0
744,Real,The Guardian,"Labour will appoint a Jewish advisory board to help oversee the creation of an independent disciplinary process to respond to incidents of antisemitism. The party announced the change, which is part of an overhaul ordered by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, after the body found it was responsible for three breaches of the Equality Act when dealing with complaints of antisemitism among members.  It has now published an ""action plan for driving out antisemitism"", which the EHRC agreed could be placed into the public domain. In it, the party commits to drafting a new process for dealing with complaints by April next year, and implementing it as soon as possible after the 2021 party conference, which would need to approve the changes. An advisory board of Jewish stakeholders will be appointed to consult about the new system, and Labour will report back to the EHRC regularly about progress. In a foreword to the document, Angela Rayner said: ""We failed the Jewish community, our members, our supporters and the country. That is why we must act to drive antisemitism out of our party and change the processes, structures and the culture of the party to ensure Jewish people feel safe to return to their political home. That requires more than just words. It requires action."" Other changes planned by Labour include ensuring the offices of the leader and deputy leader have no involvement in overseeing individual cases, and creating a culture that encourages members and staff to feel able to challenge inappropriate behaviour and, where necessary, to complain. Labour has promised to tackle the backlog of antisemitism complaints. The party also plans to strengthen its social media guidelines – a move that could potentially lead to more members being disciplined – and to improve due diligence on the social media accounts of candidates. The EHRC welcomed Labour's report. Alastair Pringle, its executive director, said: ""The Labour party has produced a comprehensive action plan that meets the recommendations made in our investigation report. It will take time to rebuild the trust of the membership and the public. This is an important step in the right direction. We are satisfied these changes are realistic and achievable and we will continue to monitor and work with the Labour party so this plan is adhered to."" While the measures were drawn up in response to the antisemitism report, they will also cover other complaints. Rayner said: ""We will be establishing an independent process to investigate complaints of antisemitism, Islamophobia, racism, sexual harassment and any discrimination based on protected characteristics."" The publication of the EHRC report in October sparked an internal Labour split after Jeremy Corbyn responded by saying the scale of the problem in the party had been ""dramatically overstated"" for political reasons. Corbyn was subsequently suspended from the Labour party. Three weeks later he was readmitted by the ruling national executive committee but Keir Starmer declined to restore the whip, so Corbyn is now sitting as an independent MP. That decision has infuriated Corbyn's supporters in the party, including his former frontbench colleagues Diane Abbott and John McDonnell. Labour's general secretary, David Evans, has banned MPs and members from expressing solidarity with Corbyn, or criticising the EHRC's findings at constituency Labour party meetings. The leftwing campaign group Momentum responded by accusing Evans of ""yet another disturbing attack on the rights of members to democratically discuss matters vital to the party"". Momentum is calling for the Labour general secretary to become an elected post. Evans was Starmer's preferred candidate for the job. Corbyn was also able to secure the post for his pick, Jennie Formby.",Real Guardian,602.0

Chancellor Rishi Sunak is braced for a major haggle for the goblets, but he can now only find himself spiralling ever tighter against the shelves. The soaring cost of fuel stands amid mounting fears of a second lockdown, this one sooner rather than later. The Chancellor is going green with a one-off invoice for a tank filling up unexpectedly fast-food restaurants and drink-driving thieves on 30 March. It is understood that the price of ethanol, the main fuel for ethanol, has soared by nearly a penny a litre since June. Demand has soared so much that Downing Street is mulling a giant crackdown. Part of the Plan B exemption for ethanol producers is due to be lifted in time for the Regional Fuel Efficiency Bill due before MPs in December. But soaring fuel prices have put enormous pressure on families and businesses. Business boss Geoff Barton,81, said: ""As we go into our post-petroleum years ethanol and petrol are THE go-to vehicles. ""If ethanol is taxed at 40 per cent, ethanol is a regulated product.

The move will allow some businesses in hard hit areas to reopen, but will also give the benefits to businesses in wealthier areas to recover as much as necessary to stay onside. Mr Sunak will today say: ""Take for example the steel industry, which has lost millions of workers. ""They rely on wages of minimum wage of zero, and can then receive a salary of over £9 an hour – ridiculous. ""Now, as the biggest economy in the world, we have had the worst hit. ""Consider the food industry. 50,000 workers are out of work over the last few days. ""They are also facing huge shortages of high quality beef and lamb.

The National Fuel and Seap Transport Authority said last night: ""The public have been assured that NHTSA marshals will be able to respond to a report of a diesel crisis – a claim which we confirm to the Committee on Privileges and Immunities is entirely false. ""As a long-standing voluntary organisation, we believe that the Government's externalities must be sought in collaboration with the MHTP and Cabinet Office."" MHTP boss and former transport secretary Tim Davie said: ""There is only one way around it – Cabinet or administration."" He also criticised the NHTSA for insisting on wearing masks when they stopped policing. The MHTP is currently in the middle of a major reform before the whole sector gave in to mask wearing. It began compulsory mask wearing in schools last month but is expected to last until July. The NHTSA said they were transparent about the amount of diesel in the air and gave the greenlight to officers to wear face masks. But last night civil liberties groups criticised the claims. Adam Brooks, Justice Secretaryhips, told The Sun: ""Since hyperinflationary disorder began, the uptake of masks has been rapid. ""This work demonstrates that the time since August 1 has been ripe for a rapid and nationwide public health response. ""The NHTSA have carefully considered all the evidence and, as a result, they seem to think it plausible that their new face mask design would be controversial. ""However, concern over the use of masks in London continues to be a topic of considerable controversy. ""The NHTSA have been told that masks do decrease the risk of contracting Covid-19, so it's not surprising that they are concerned."" But Mr Brooks hit back: ""I hope that the NHTSA think twice before giving a talk about something that seems to be growing more and more in body mass/incidence."" He added: ""It seems that the more we talk to people who see the data, the more convinced we are that the data is correct. ""We see cases all over the place – in hospitals, in practice - of being blown up or blown up by aerodisc in flight. ""It's ridiculous. It seems almost every day brings more cases. It's ridiculous to think that getting people to a clinic and having surgeries is tomorrow."" His plea was echoed by senior Conservative MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith, who urged: ""Cut it. Cut it."" The former Tory leader warned: ""The NHS should be a commonsense right-to-buy right here in our country."" And he said: ""The more we are able to buy into it, the more people will want it. ""The more we can persuade people to go on being NHS patients, the more people will want it. ""There is a reason why we have the free school meals, the charity funding the holidays. There isn't a reason why our schools are not being directed to open on Boxing Day."" Despite his opposition to compulsory vaccinations, Mr Duncan Smith told the BBC: ""I strongly deny that there's a vaccine, I deny that it's necessary for this task. ""I deny that it's required education in this country. I deny that it's a potential bright spot.

""We will not forget the time when Mitch McConnell created this battle between good and evil and when he united his staff and Cabinet to form a plan to defeat the Government."" The Labour leader said that with so many pupils leaving university without a proper plan of action they are being ""betrayed"". He said: ""The sad truth is that the Education Secretary has been a banker, a multimillionaire and a tinkerer. Nothing compares with the loss of life, where that precious young child cannot continue his education or receive the attention and support he deserves."" Mr Johnson joined Chancellor Rishi Sunak in proposing the UC cut in next year's school budget - which will be cut by 25% - and suggested it could be paid for by scrapping the 30-year plan. The Chancellor had told the nation that £5 added to schools budgeted for this year was unaffordable. The Chancellor told the nation: ""You can't spend on a school the investment needed to improve the curriculum is in the school budget to be affordable."" The Government is already spending £1.6bn a year on UC but the plan which the Government plans to announce today will be compared to what it will cost the NHS in the event of a NHS collapse.

After months of being ""bizarre"", the Government is finally admitting that it could be that we don't need to hike energy prices as soon as we reopen the economy. Labour has branded the plan ""bizarre"" and ""out of touch"" with the needs of businesses.

Mr Johnson will face the toughest questions yet on his handling of the pandemic as a result of Mr Cummings' long-awaited showdown with the Commons science and health committees. For weeks he has been engaged in a bitter tit-for-tat with his former closest adviser over leaked text messages and key decisions he made as Covid rates spiralled. In the most serious blow to Mr Johnson's authority there were also claims that he intimidated doctors into dropping their offer to admit their patients ahead of next week's election report. Health Secretary Sajid Javid is expected to ask MPs to back his demand that all NHS contracts awarded to the companies facing financial difficulty be signed off by 2020. Mr Javid wants to sign up, rather than to order, more contracts before the end of the year. His deputy said: ""It's a negotiating tactic. They seek to take us for fools and so they make it sound like they want to rip up the contracts. ""If they want to rip up contracts then they need to understand that we will back them up with full details and power to change them.

Boris Johnson has warned that a sudden fall-out of the Brexit agreement with Northern Ireland could happen as soon as Covid. Ministers have been warned that second-guessing plans for a Northern Ireland-style border could happen as soon as EU leaders meet. The Prime Minister said: ""We're going to get along so much better than we've ever been before."" And he dismissed suggestions that he is preparing to ""rip up"" the Britain-EU relationship. After the première of May 17, the PM will leave for Ecuador on Monday meaning he could try to get on the London timetable. A deal could not be struck before the summer break which also saw Sykes open a UK-Mexico border. But EU officials claimed that Mr Johnson was ready to accept the Canberra PM's claim for patience and possibly kill us all. A No 10 spokesman said: ""We are confident of securing a smooth deal for our country and our people. ""We are confident of persuading the European Commission to reverse its decision and allow for the possibility for a new round of vaccine restrictions."" But Mr Johnson's own Covid talks have been accused of taking place earlier this month and May 17. One European diplomat told the Mirror: ""It's ridiculous. ""It shows that the minds of the EU are not developed"". Brussels has already delivered a lengthy offer of leverage to try to force Mr Johnson to change its position. Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney told EU diplomats in London on Monday they had to treat the offer as ""a slap in the face"" to Boris Johnson's commitment to extend the vaccine to June 21. EU diplomats believe that they are now in a position to round up, or ""rip up"" the offer of a second jab, after objections from the UK Government. EU diplomats told the British Government they had to ""use their judgement"" and that they should consider the letter instead. After weeks of humiliation, the EU has finally kicked up a process for stepping up proposals. A document obtained by the Mirror showed EU officials are currently working on a letter to the Government offering their views on the matter. The letter, obtained by the Mirror, reveals that the UK Government remains opposed to the spread of the virus in ""high places"" including in schools, hospitals, and in cinemas. It also continues to push for a vaccine passport system for France as it attempts to strike a deal with the EU. EU diplomats also believe that France is still the only country not to have received a letter from Brussels warning it of a possible risk from a jab.

There is also still ""unprecedented"" delay in adding India to the UK's existing ""extreme"" list of ""high risk"" countries.

No10 said he would ""tick each boxes"" and ""increase the threshold"" for holding reporters up at Westminster to avoid prosecution. He insisted that it would mean ""more trouble for the policeman than it will for me"". Mr Johnson did give the Prime Minister exclusive access to Parliament which no other officeholder has ever had. And he dismissed the Commons tactic of having its members vote remotely from the House of Commons. In a blow to the spirits industry, the PM had told MPs there was no point having two ""off the hook"" MPs who are ""responsible"" for their constituents. Treasury insiders said there was ""not much I can do"" about breaking the law by voting remotely from the House of Lords. In a scathing report, the Telegraph reported how New Health was busted up between June 23 and August 5 last year after some 14,000 households had their Covid health plans derailed. The post-Christmas restrictions sparked fury and public outcry as they brought the UK's cases for Covid-19 in four days. Mr Johnson told the Commons during his visit to the Commons chamber that MPs should ""hold their breath"" over new restrictions until the case rates for the second wave of the vaccine are better. He promised he had a plan ""in the next few weeks"" to help the thousands of vulnerable people who still cannot vote with their head. But with smoking rates still low and millions of people living in houseguests and remote areas facing restrictions, it looked like the only feasible way to help them was to have our second wave of restrictions curtailed. Only 14 people died from smoking-related causes last year, which was 14.4% higher than the previous year. Sadiq Khan, who led the campaign for a second time to be allowed into Parliament, claimed it was ""a little bit late"" to act. The PM had told MPs he was not prepared to take on all restrictions at the same time. ""I'm not prepared to take responsibility,"" he said. ""We've run out of money, we've run out of ambition, we cannot just make an independent decision based on one supplier."" Mr Johnson's no-confidence said: ""I don't think it is any longer just us and BAE Systems. I think also we have to go beyond justFE.""

Ministers are likely to announce a decision on the plans last November, just days after earning their Tory heartlands a positive response to the pandemic. Cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg told MPs the Government would ""learnively"" update the entry criteria for Brits coming to the UK to ensure they are fully vaccinated. The Foreign Secretary told MPs that Europe's vaccine roll-out suggested the UK could not only guarantee vaccinations for its citizens, but would also be able to offer them ""special"" support. Vaccines CEO Patrick Dujarric said the UK had ""days, not hours"" to get a grip on the situation and could take other measures to help drive down arrivals. But he added: ""It really does risk us getting a significant lift in the next weeks and months"". Government insiders suggested Mr Rees-Mogg could block any restrictions by saying the Government had to make a ""hard decision"" on the Five Eyes agreement, which banned both UK and EU countries from doing business in the EU. That move would mean easier measures such as sanctuary states and visa blockades in the EU.

But Mr Johnson has put forward two alternative measures for parents who could be hit hardest by the soaring rates of infection. He said: ""We will do everything in our power to help people who have been provided the ability to travel abroad, and we will do everything we can to help people who have been vaccinated or who are planning to vaccinate."" The winter months will also be limited to primary school children and adults in England, as the Government moves to keep pupils in place until June 21. Scientists have claimed that the predicted split during the first year of the new National Health Strategy aims to be ""virtually non-existent"" for certain social regions of the UK. Deputy PM Dominic Raab said last night: ""It's almost too late to avoid the virus. ""There are going to be critical periods during the pandemic where case rates are going to be really, really high. ""That's why I think it's quite scary."" He suggested that if we ended up looking like we're still looking like it a ""journey hell"" for many people, then it was too late. Mr Raab added: ""The fact is that the Government knows this doesn't look very good for young people, that it doesn't look very good for young people, and that it doesn't look very good for young people at all."" Labour has said it would be a ""huge mistake"" to scrap the changes after they were made because they could make the situation worse if young people continue to be under threat. Mr Raab added: ""The fact is that the Government knows this doesn't look very good for young people, that it doesn't look very good for young people, and that it doesn't look very good at all."" The changes to the Teaching for Leaders programme will be brought in under a split Government. The TUC has found that almost a year after the drop-out figures were recorded, 33% of those leaving education failed to meet their academic and pastoral targets for two years after they returned. The failure of many schools to meet their targets has prompted fears that some schools are shutting or are going into legislating cases instead. While this is unlikely to change today, the Government is said to be confident that the academic and pastoral teams will step in and help us to get it right."" It comes as figures yesterday showed the UK's daily GCSE exams for all youngsters fell to lowest on earth in November There are still 22 exams being offered in schools across the country, but in which children were last month told they could only get two years of Covid exams. There are also two that were unavailable to some children last July and August, but are now needed. There were a further 14,000 children off school in September. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is refusing to bring in another 8,000 Covid exams this summer, and is said to be unwilling to the British Education Leaders' Group's call for more support for the demand for compulsory Covid exams. Writing in the Telegraph, Mr Williamson said: ""We've had enough of the excuses the Government has. ""From delivering on the school success accrual accords, to refusing to invest in the toughest Schools Act 2030 and inaction on the front line in tackling the crisis."" He added: ""The hypocrisy from this Government knows no bounds. ""It goes without saying that students from deprived backgrounds should have access to quality education and support, and should have access to quality careers advice."" From the Tories down to her side, there was even anger in the Tory ranks with some Tory MPs suggesting that Labour should stick with the disastrous arrangements provided by the Health Secretary. Tory MPs have threatened to vote against a motion to keep the payment - which they believe is essential to keep pupils in the classroom - unless there is more work to do to address the problem. A further threat comes in the wake of the Labour Leader's pledge to ""repeal and replace"" the act with a ""fundamental change"" such as extending school hours. While no two MPshed formulas for action were carried out, Labour has put forward a desire to see the Commons act now so that MPs can return to Westminster for a vote. In the event, the Government did return to Westminster for a vote on the changes on November 15. But it remains unclear whether that will happen, with the proposed changes only appearing on the back of a motion.",Gen Mirror,852.0

Let's focus on jobs, jobs and the economy  Boris Johnson has been saying for weeks  [Labour, Tories & unions] - the Prime Minister will today try to move on from the damaging saga that began with last year's Brexit. Boris Johnson tried to rip up Britain's divorce from France as he walked away from a summit with French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House. The Prime Minister had insisted that France was not part of the ""Last Hours"" tour and could not be held responsible for the ""foul disruption"" at nightclubs and gigs last night. As he left the summit Downing Street was reported to be gathering dust under unimpressed staff. No 10 was said to be unwilling to help Mr Johnson get his message out. One source said: ""They're having to change their approach. They're not having much of a plan."" The PM has been warned that more staff shortages will lead to confusion and anger among the Tory left. Boris Johnson tried to rip up Britain's divorce from France as he walked away from a summit with French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House on Tuesday. Mr Johnson said he was ""very optimistic"" that Brexit negotiations could be concluded today - despite fierce criticism from his own Tory backbenchers. The PM put his stamp of authority on the French President by promising to be an ""intolerable crime"" but Britain was ""not willing to stand in their way"". No 10 was said to be willing to accept that leaving the EU would be ""irresponsible"" and ""irresponsible"" for our peace and security. It would therefore require a change of the Brexit deal. Brexit minister Lord Frost issued a veiled threat that if France and Germany pulled out then the EU would ""have to withdraw"". Mr Johnson's remarks come after French President Emmanuel Macron threatened a ""pinochet order"" response against the UK if he left office. Brussels has delivered a foreign policy mauling since France and Germany kicked off their fourth wave of migrant surges last month, with Western sanctions designed to exert an influence on the bloc. But Mr Johnson's departure has sparked concern in the corridors of Government as to whether the UK will remain a ""red wall"" or a ""green wall"" in the South China Sea. After days of dragging his feet, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab threw a press conference in the Queen's Speech mired in controversy. However, the Labour leader painted a picture of a Government that is ""lost in the waters"" as they try to figure out how they can best help the world's poorest people. He told the BBC: ""The world is turning against us, people are angry about the Afghanistan policy and the Iraq policy, but we have no business being silent. ""We have got to be clear that the line is very clearly that we cannot and should not be silent. ""We are not alone in this. There are all nations around the world trying to build safer, more responsible green spaces. ""But we are not alone in this. ""We must do everything we can to help those who wish to leave."" Mr Raab also claimed that the ""end result"" of Brexit would be a spike in cases highlighting the difficulty of getting around our shores. Asked if he meant by saying ""we can't be held back"" like Germany is, he said:  ""We should be very, very strong. We can't be held back."" The PM finally admitted that German Chancellor Angela Merkel was not exactly known for her ""open"" attitude towards freedoms. He told the US President: ""Tom [Nadal] Keynes was a brilliant economist. But he was also a free man. Can we make free trade a fact, then suddenly be accused of being soft on crime? ""There are many, many things that can go wrong together,"" he added. It is the second time in as many weeks that the UK has stepped up tensions with Germany over our railway links. The PM has also suggested that France may not want to fund its mandatory vaccination programme while Britain is in a vegetative state. On Thursday, Mr Johnson told MPs the Government would have to act sooner if vaccines fail to curb transmission in the UK. He said: ""I think it is not possible for the Government to delay the benefits from this vaccine rollout through to the autumn."" The Health Secretary refused to rule out another lockdown next winter when he left for a holiday in Spain. But he was unable to say whether that would be easier than existing lockdowns in Europe.",Gen Mirror,767.0

Confirmed dead include people infected with the Indian variant, pregnant women and girls and pregnant women and mothers-in-law. Organised cremations start today and are likely to continue for some time. No 10 has denied that the figures are wrong and that the crisis is connected to Brexit. The PM has insisted the problem is down to ""more people coming in from the Continent"". But Mr Johnson told the Speaker that Canada, which has high obesity rates, was ""not on the list"" but that ""more people"" had come in from Europe to visit family. And he prompted disbelief among Conservatives. ""Why are they killing people off because they found a way around them?"" he asked. Mr Johnson added: ""We will fix it. We will bring it into the 21st century."" It is the second Government in less than 24 hours to announce that Britain has decided to leave the EU. The first leaving gracener was Theresa May's Brexit deal which she said would be ""a mauling seat"" for trade. The Government had been pressing ahead with a temporary agreement with EU countries after the June 23 referendum alleging that it was ""on the cards"" for years. But Mr Johnson said today: ""We cannot continue to have the arguments that are being made today, the phenomenal achievements which are pulling us down this road, are not being made in a practical way. ""These are serious times that require serious action. ""We are not isolating cities because they are no longer economically viable, they are also making them very difficult for us as a multinational company."" Under the deal, different EU countries would work together to create ""trade deals"" that threatened to overwhelm the UK with trade deficits. Britain would join the US in the latest trade deals after a series of poor deals struck by Republican President Donald Trump were scrapped. Mr Johnson said: ""The point here is not tariffs, it's cooperation. If you want us to do trade deals with you, you have to do them with us."" Earlier, the PM had insisted he was ""not interested"" in renegotiating the deal which he had negotiated with President Barack Obama. He has instead proposed ""onetising"" the talks so that the UK can get a better deal from US firms after years of infighting in the White House. Trade Secretary Jody Day warned that tariffs - taxes on imports - are not on the table because China is a ""next best friend"" for the UK. She also revealed that the UK has ""very serious question marks"" about whether the extension of the UK's territorial claims in the South China Sea will be able to be considered as a legal basis for a military attack on the US mainland. Next biggest is Amazon's $144bn strike capability, which it says it enjoys ""unconditional"" access. But the tech giant - which has developed submarines, destroyers and landmines - says it is ""easily available"" for strike action in the South China Sea. Mr Johnson took charge of the shipbuilding plant when it went into shut down in November - and asked Amazon to buy more land as it began to re-open in the region. But the British PM lost the trust of workers there after he revealed that he had turned down the offer of a permanent base from Amazon to build the controversial military tech. The PM also accused the EU of putting British interests above those of their European partners. Here we learn that the EU is backing a new wave of Russian military intervention in the region which could lead to the loss of Amazon land. The plant that makes the anti-ballistic detectors in the Indian sub-continent is Amazon's biggest business and has seen financial results that indicate it could struggle to compete with Russian new cruise missiles. The EU has indicated that it would be a ""very difficult decision"" but the UK could stay in place for another year to ensure that they can strike at the heart of the country to stop development of nuclear warheads. There are fears that the EU may want to consider Amazon's huge trade surplus with the UK - minus the cost of doing business with it. But the British Government could threaten to take over the business assets of the EU when it expires in June. A trade deal with the US is also understood to be very much on the table despite Boris Johnson's promises. But the Mirror understands that France is prepared to consider Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's request for British firms to move to the European Union - even though they are not subject to the UK's commitments there.

Unite is opposing the idea that children should simply get a penny from their teachers as long as they don't take home the pittance they earn as virtual free school meals. The union's British Institute director Alastair Campbell added: ""The idea of private school vouchers for post-teachers is ridiculous."" The Department for Education has said that whole-school maths and science exams can now be free for all pupils.

Unite is representing NHS nurses in the Domestic Abuse Squad who say they are being threatened with demotion. They want the pay increase to end so they can be classified as ""pre-departure"" nurses. The last thing NHS staff are going to be told is that they will not have to worry about demotion when they return to the office. Around 36,000 domestic abuse reports a day are false and the number of officers are set to rocket this year. Labour has announced plans to CGMP a campaign to understand the real reason for the cut - and provide a way of seeing it after polls close. Over 125,000 nurses worked last week as a whole week shift, down from nearly 120,000 a day for 16 weeks ago. They found that some members were forced to isolate, others sickened, while pregnant women and children had to nurse back to home ward. Some staff even had to be evicted. The party has planned an advertising campaign to highlight the promise of support for Boris Johnson and the investment Johnson gave to the NHS. It also plans to take a 50% stake in Covid Healthcare, worth £42.8bn, worth a huge increase.

But Chief Executive of the Children's Society of America Rand Wishart warned that all parents would ""go dark"" as a result of the triple threat. Last week the union chief said the vaccination programme was ""bone-arding"" and that it risked confusing children with adults. Mr Wishart said: ""The message from the Government is really, really difficult. ""There's a need for quick action. We don't want our children to die from something they don't agree with."" The Government has already spent more than £800 million on the scheme with many delays and inertia. Mr Wishart added: ""What does that say about the future? We have got a vaccine programme that is going to be different this year than the one we've had this year."" Vaccine hesitancy among young people has decreased. In those aged 18 to 21, it almost halved from 9 per cent to 5 per cent. The numbers of Omicron cases are comparable with the previous year. The findings suggest it is ""of prime importance"" that young people get their own vaccine after checking with their local NHS department. Dr Lenny Henry, general secretary of the NASU, said: ""The situation has got so bad now that we need to be pretty confident about that. ""It's not only about Health Secretary, it's also about our young people. If we can get them vaccinated, we will be in a position to provide them with everything we can to help them make a full recovery."" Vaccine hesitancy has decreased in all age groups except young people. It also increased in all racial and ethnic groups except young people. The hesitancy of young people to have the jab also decreased in all age groups except children 16 and over. Doctors are now more cautious about the jab than at any time in their history. The findings are an improvement over the July 27 survey that showed the majority of people (68%) would support the Government's plan to provide vaccinated secondary school children with the vaccine. The teachers' bill would still be paid by the school meal plan but would be replaced by a new, less-fairer plan that allows the school meal to cover the Vaccacard tuition. The Government could, however, reintroduce its controversial ""One Free Schools"" voucher scheme for a total of £10,000 per pupil over three years, worth £10,000 for every pupil vaccinated. The JRF, which will be split equally between schools, said the Government's funding proposal ""makes no sense"" and will cost the hard-won vaccine rights of over 5million pupils over the next five years. The scheme was introduced in the run-up to last Christmas's election with huge pledges from the Tony Blair and George Eustice campaigns.

The right thing is for the government to act now, and to accept the budget and act on it today."" In his budget speech last Wednesday, the chancellor said he would create ""poverty pay"" that would cover the rising costs of farming and other sectors. Pledging to make sure ""we don't have to switch economies"", the chancellor said: ""When we bring jobs back, we'll have enough money to feed the economy and save the families who have worked so hard over the pandemic. We can't have enough of working, and we can't have enough of saving people's time."" Removing the antisubordinate system of redundancies was a deliberate political decision, as the Labour leader was acutely aware until Starmer moved to different days. 1963: Labour members' strike for the first time More than a decade later, the phrase ""new society"" revealed itself as the dividing line between the disparate sides of the Conservative vote. As well as being widely used by George Osborne to describe what was then the Conservative party, the new antisocial personality rules only applied to Osborne-era policies. That meant tackling the problem of antisocial behaviour – bad faith – was not on the agenda. Meanwhile, the economy was still recovering from the Covid pandemic, and the sanction for breaking the rules under the Communities and Social Security Act of 2010 was being rolled out to schools across the country. Despite the new face of the Conservative party, the antisocial personality, Paul Stephenson, the shadow cabinet office minister, was the latest former Conservative leader to question the party's approach to tackling the problem of antisocial behaviour. Michael Gove was notably absent from the PLP's conference last Wednesday because, as Johnson said at the time, ""we have a new motion coming down on Thursday that will be a motion machine for antisocial behaviour."" However, fellow Labour MPs Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn have been campaigning for him to be considered as a potential prime minister, to help those in need, to argue against Keir Starmer's radical immigration agenda.  As well as Galloway, Starmer announced he would create a committee to discuss the country's concerns before the winter months come to an end. Labour has so far declined to rule out an attempt to move Galloway into number two on the short list of potential ministers, after the former prime minister Paterson resigned over sexual harassment allegations. Alex Allan, the Labour MP for Streatham, who has supported Curtice's candidacy, tweeted on Friday morning: ""If Stephen Amess is saved from death by being attracted to by a stallion, I would be willing to wing it."" He also repeated his insistence that the government does not ""pull the rug out"" from under fallen ministers – though he did not specify what that might include. The silence from Starmer's office has alarmed some in his own party who believe the prime minister must deal with the issue of sexual harassment more intently. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow cabinet Office minister, tweeted on Saturday morning: ""Keir has not pulled the rug out from under Keir Clarke-Symonds yet. He is sticking with him because he knows what he stands for."" Some ministers, including the chancellor, are also baffled by the scale of the breach of trust issue. The original intention of the agreement was to allow a select group of public figures to disclose personal financial information, but the government changed the rules to ensure such disclosures would not trigger a response from the Electoral Commission. David Cameron's predecessor, Theresa May, struck a deal with the data mining company Deepas that allowed it to automatically generate figures for parliamentarians and other influential figures, much of them parliament employees. Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May, has neverbeforehad a session with a corporation that manufactures MP-branded personal protective equipment.

As he arrived in White Hart Lane this weekend, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, was delivering a major reshuffle across the government as he imposed a series of draconian measures including a complete end to the planning system.  The plans, which will be put to a vote next week, will be helpful in setting out what Labour's planned spending cuts will look like, and whether they can be allocated £1bn of the £36bn planned plans' likely target. Its spending priorities will then be carefully marked – with social care, which the government is doubling, and other high-cost areas the government hopes can be home to the UK's first genuine digital music festival. Cameron will keep clearances for both the medical profession and the NHS but is expected to be asked to back away from plans to increase immigration. The former permanent secretary to the Treasury Nick Macpherson told Times Radio this week immigration was once again on the agenda at Labour's conference in Brighton. ""We want to change the minds of heartsets and minds wide,"" he said. ""Covid is the key change and we're the party that brings the best out of it, that works for every single aspect of our country."" He said a Labour government would carefully consider whether its border policy fits the national interest. ""We already think that our border policy is a good thing, but it will have to be a good thing for both the country and the economy,"" he said. Seema Malhotra, the director of research at the Foundation for an Honest Economy, said: ""The living standards outlook for 2021 looks bleak at present – but the government can directly improve it."" She stressed that the odds were always against the idea of a global deal, but the climate was likely to be much worse than currently envisaged. ""If the odds are against it, Labour will surrender,"" she said. The renationalisation campaign group Momentum told the Guardian it would act on this week by briefing the government directly. ""We believe that the policies that we're considering Monday's package will give us – with the support of Labour – to take the next step on the road to universal credit,"" Momentum said. ""We are seeing evidence of support from the industry and trade unions – and particularly from staff and student groups – showing that the benefits we are claiming are sufficient to keep us going."" The transport secretary, Robert Jenrick, has also backed the wider plans, although he insisted nothing was ruling out a switch to the cloud. Jenrick told MPs on Thursday: ""Nothing is preventing us from taking this step further, but it is important we can take this step on the road to zero emissions. ""I think this is just the beginning. We need to think about how we move beyond just megacorporations."" In a separate interview with Sophy Ridge on Sky News, he defended the government's handling of the pandemic in recent weeks, insisting there had been no unilateral action by the industry either directly or indirectly.

Instead, he highlighted the misdemeanours that could accompany a 30-day suspension from the UK – such as public toilets and unvaccinated people, for example. ""The nature of the virus means it is not possible to separate out the ringleader, who in turn is unable to remove the mask,"" he said. ""The government must remove the criminal element quickly, and solely by executive order."" Johnsonren brushed off claims that he and Theresa May were trying to shoehorn some powers in together, insisting they were.

The Institute for Government (IfG) think tank had warned on Tuesday that the high number of infections could undermine the vaccination programme.

The UK has a Genre watch committee, chaired by the former Conservative cabinet ministers Greg Clark and Jeremy Hunt, who are liaising with other G7 countries on how to improve market access. Johnson said: ""This is a great opportunity for us to put our best forward as a potential future global leader. With what we have done so far, we may well come away with better results than we had. ""I just think now we should really look at how the business [renaises] – how the business is doing, and whether it is making money."" He said the G7 could come up with a new contract of ""at least £100m/yr"", for example. As before, the UK will host the Copenhagen summit at which to decide how many world leaders can attend. Discussions are likely to begin again this week with the aim of establishing a ""global summit de co-operation"" of climate and agriculture leaders, and securing some form of free trade deal with the US. There has been scant diplomatic effort to reach an agreement at summits like the 2010 Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow or the 11 June summit in Washington. Johnson said he was concerned about the risks of developing countries taking on the challenge of choking off the transition to net zero. ""We have got to be bolder in the way we are going to make this happen. And the world has got to be more cautious about pushing the boundaries of this. ""I just worry that it's becoming bandied about, that the only real way forward is if there are still lingering tensions."" Johnson has been forced to acknowledge during his US visit that a trade agreement with the US would be a good moment to boost trade between the two countries, but declined to confirm whether there would be any progress made until the deal is concluded.

""I don't think the prime minister has done enough to prevent this happening more frequently,"" Johnson said. He cited the fact that the UK has fewer hospitals in the first wave of the pandemic than had been expected, saying: ""We are having to step up to the plate."" Johnson conceded that a ""huge amount of work"" is being done throughout the pandemic, but stressed that it was critical that the right measures were not taken in the first place. He said the government had set out clear plans for the coming weeks. ""We have pointed them out to the public at the appropriate stage, and they have accepted that there is no imminent risk of a danger of the virus mutating,"" he said.

While Leadsom will no doubt be heavily influenced by the conference results, his ability to launch policy shifts and develop what he thought was a winning deal may help him to win over new members quickly. And it may also open up the opportunity for him to draw more new members to the party, who have a much harder time filling out the shadow cabinet if the electorate is not persuadable.

After May's deeply disappointing result in the Brexit referendum, the Treasury was notably absent from the press conferences and briefings, aside from a few short stories, such as the Heretofore Unemployed Unite leader's dire explanation that his actions could undermine the party's ability to exist as a collective. There have been modest signs in recent weeks that the public are beginning to forget about the nasty bits, such as Boris Johnson's boastful Twitterseduction of the junior health minister's private life: and the much larger drip of abuse from a Sun newspaper independent staffer. But this week's Tory conference has been carefully manoeuvrevered to give themselves a chance to boast about their electoral successes, instead of to take a conscious and transparent decision to support them in the upcoming contests. Having failed to materialise overnight on Saturday afternoon, Johnson's ""levelling up"" pledge has proved much more difficult to deliver. Levelling up is a phrase that has endured a string of reputational damage control measures throughout the pandemic, all of which have at times appeared fruitless. Vaccinations are now regularly extended, at latest prospectus lengths and possibly even indefinitely, to boost turnout. Meanwhile, with almost all of the campaigning in the race to succeed Cameron foul played by Dominic Cummings, the policy questions remain persistently acute. Even before Maddow's lockdown-busting speech on Saturday, the attempt to overhaul the electoral process was having an impact. The devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have all announced they will review the electoral arrangement to ensure they achieve their overarching aims, and a string of cases have already been reported burglarising individuals' phones. Johnson's official spokesperson has insisted no plans have been changed, adding that ""nothing has changed"". His official spokesperson has also repeatedly denied - and UKRT has been repeatedly denied - that there are any plans for a ""Brownout"" of any sort, with the public being instead given a vote on the legislation as originally planned. Government insiders are infuriated by the drip, drip of accusations from the former adviser, whom many believe failed to fully grasp the implications of the pandemic until it set in motion last spring, long before he became leader. The latest disclosure by a cabinet department concerned with the handling of the pandemic is the reopening of the elections manifesto, which was automatically withdrawn after a backlash from Tory MPs. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, has confirmed the reopening will take place. Javid said: ""We're setting out the surest way forward, because if we follow the rules, we'll certainly move on."" The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, also confirmed on Saturday that Mohamed Ashrawi had been temporarily banned from the UK from entering the press room during Boris Johnson's reshuffle. The pair met for the first time on Friday, and the first evidence that the prime minister has a plan was delivered when faced with the challenge of deleting it from his website. As Johnson prepared to introduce the bill to parliament on Monday, the cabinet announced that legislation would be passed, entitled the Care Act 2015, that will give families the power to make savings from the next general election by allowing the government to use the money raised by having a vaccine phased out. There was no mention in the bill of the possibility of aćhen, meaning ""no more vaccines"" – but Dominic Raab was unable to guarantee that his provision would take effect immediately. ""We are still working through the implementation details, but aćhen, meaning 'no more' is definitely a possibility, but we are working closely with the health secretary, to see what the best implementation may be,"" he said. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, who was once expected to be a potential leadership candidate, has been attacked relentlessly by Johnson and his chancellor, Rishi Sunak, over the past year after the civil war in the Yvette Cooper camp. On 13 May, Johnson gave her the go-ahead to introduce the legislation as he set out a cautious first step through the Covid crisis. He said: ""What I don't think it is, is the definitive brand-changing change in the government's approach. The boldest thing we can can can be to treat this as nothing more than a scorecard game."" He then went on to say that no political party had succeeded in changing the rules – though the independent political consultancy Vote Leave had its own version of the phrase ""political impossibility"". Johnson's fellow union leaders gave him a pass when they set up a common position on common ownership, but the prime minister felt the need to try to reassuring leaders at their next destination, including the Cop26 climate summit, that they were doing so safely.

Since the summer, isolated cases have been more frequently and cronyism in the party has become even more evident. The party has been particularly keen not to take a leaf off its predecessor's stick, after Yvette Cooper's plea for unity at the height of the Omicron crisis.  As Starmer's team awaited the results of a ""spin"" test on whether to hold a general election, the shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, was among the scores of journalists who have flooded into the Guardian to urge the public to ""stay at home, protect the NHS and improve public health messaging"". The Medical Association of Britain (MAB) said the announcement on Wednesday was a ""gamechanger"", as MPs continued to be exposed to the Omicron wave on Wednesday.  ""It is entirely fair to say that this current wave of public health pandemic is a chink in the government's armour which they are going to have to close,"" said Deborah Mattinson, assistant commissioner for NHS services. ""It appears somewhat remote that we are today, being at the cutting edge of this, but the plan we are presenting is the cutting edge of this and it's only right that we can now hold together the fragile foundations of our society,"" she said. As well as being widely used by Clinton in 2016, the ""Stronger Together"" slogan became a political slogan until recently, when it came under different names from supportive to crybabyobscura to callousclerotic.  Priti Patel has come under particularly prominent attack since she was filmed making small talk on a phone call with the health secretary, Sajid Javid, suggesting there may have been up to 20,000 infections among staff in her office. Since Johnson's announcement of a 1.25-percentage-point rise in national insurance contributions (NICs) in July, pressure on the government to increase benefits has been palpable. Some backbenchers have called on Starmer to use the veto over legislation benefiting the rich, such as the one Gina Coladangelo signed up to. The New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) has called on the government to look at reforming the health service – particularly how Rishi Sunak can be more effective at getting people into workwear. Last month the president of the European commission, Ursula Von der Leyen, called on the government to brace for a resurgence in infections as the off-year pandemic turned its attent. The prime minister's official spokesman has insisted the Omicron transmission was the product of a single event, which was ""not a variant Omicron variant"". But Giuseppe Mariani, the prime minister's new health secretary, has declined to say whether the government can fall back on its earlier promises. He told the parliamentary Labour group it would be ""premature"" to say ""this is the result of a single event"", because of the ""variantity"" of the virus.  Mariani said data about the prevalence of the variant was not yet available, but it was ""highly likely"" that the new strain is already present in general and noticeable in the form of loud popsicles such as those seen in the capital this week. ""As well as being a great way to show that the government is serious about avoiding a repeat of the last crisis, this week may be just the moment we can get the government out of a bit of a jam this week,"" he said. Unlike last spring, when Sage scientists were unsuccessfully pressuring Boris Johnson to order a ""circuit-breaker"" lockdown, the makeup of the British public were Sugar and Javid, two of the seven most recent terms for which data is publicly available. Johnson's spokesperson said his decision was ""based on evidence presented to the government at the mid-week open house"". When the health secretary said he did not yet have the data, he was met with boos from the public, who later recalled that the prime minister had already said he had not been the first who regretted the decision to send the message to the population. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been dogged in recent months by questions about how he will answer those questions, given that he was health secretary under the Jeremy Corbyn government. Asked repeatedly on Sky News whether he would reveal any details of how the government will construct the complex sounding board, he was repeatedly asked the question again on Sky News on Wednesday, and declined to give a concrete proposal. Instead, he said he would like journalists to take a ""long, hard look at themselves"" at the decisions they have made.

As the party's membership surges in the coming weeks, the former Labour administrations minister will say that a new set of rules will inevitably be used to ""tune"" existing restrictions.  ""The time has come for us to make the best use of our new skills, to bring about a new, more integrated future,"" she will say. ""We live in a digital age where people are rapidly identifying as digital moves, and the transmission of our knowledge is being blocked. At the same time, we are seeing evidence of rapid changes in technology, and the potential for transformative effects.""  Starmer will argue that the new regulations – which will come into force from 21 June – are needed to prevent the government from continuing to allow up to three households to mix for up to five days, and 4,000 Covid cases from 15 June. ""The Conservatives have moved so far this week by making Boris Johnson's health service appear chaotic and dangerous,"" he will say. ""Now it seems clear that the only people actually doing things dangerous are the Conservatives. Addressing this threat using the new, sensible regulations that are being imposed on us all is the wrong priority for Ministers. Instead of trying to restrain our economy, we should be making sure that our production and use of technology is being allowed to flourish."" He will argue that the new regulations will mean a big change in the legal status of ""Covid"" access, where all adults can have a test result so they can be more closely watched, but the Conservatives have undermined the country's ability to weather the Covid crisis. ""The best thing that can happen when we're able to follow the lead of the US and Australian strides forward in this regard is that we can start to think about things towards the new, higher strongly recommended three-mile stretch of the road that will eventually become the new Eden Project,"" he will say.

Johnson has been widely expected to clarify that his government is solely concerned with the compensation people can receive for driving. But after the Oxford/AstraZeneca ruling, and a series of tweets and documents leak attempts, the prime minister has cut across the idea that the £20-a-week increase in universal credit proposed by the government amounts to a tax hike on incomes too. Allies said the cut, which will come into force after 10 years, will mainly impact on taking down the wall in the wake of the next general election. ""The government is looking at all things tax, so this is a fairly straightforward cut,"" said one. But one government source conceded that ""nothing is concrete"" and that ""nothing is certain"". As well as wrong-footed by the welfare state and outflanked by sky-high energy bills, the £20-a-week cut to universal credit amounts to a slew of tax increases ready to go ahead next month, Tory backbenchers said they will be bitterly disappointed not to see them through. Referring to new plans to make flexible working the default, Sunak said: ""This would be a good time to think about moving to a life of flexible working, so that everyone can enjoy the benefits of flexible employment."" However, Sunak's arrival as health secretary did not guarantee that he will be able to meet the end of the deal himself.

838,Generated,The Guardian,"Buck plug. The culture secretary, Priti Patel, who has been consistently sacked by her boss, over the past year or so, is now safe from pay cuts as she seeks to focus on writing a book. Apparently, after reading the recent expose by the Committee Against Corruption, she was not expecting this. The Committee Against Corruption is a part of the wider Labour party, and is chaired by the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell. Several of the key figures mentioned by Young Labour in a recent profile – including international trade secretary Liam Fox, who was sacked by Theresa May for breaching the ministerial code – have had close Tory connections. However, the substance of the relationship did not quite match up with the caricature of Johnson as an outriders target. Indeed, the serious crime bill finally passed by the House of Commons on Wednesday was barely concealed by the government. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, was openly asked by a shadow cabinet member what he would do if asked a question by a constituent about travel. ""I would say, do you planning to move forward?"" the constituent replied. ""Yes, I am very familiar with the area,"" replied the health secretary. Like many before him, he had barely concealed the fact that he was carrying a £200 bill on his shoulders. Unlike many before him, the deposed former prime minister was not going to lie about being scared: he was extremely, very scared. Indeed, his instincts were to try to flee the country as quickly as possible – if they could, therefore they had to. The international trade secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, was recently due to deliver her speech at the dinner of the government's new economic adviser, Matthew Doyle, on Downing Street.  But by Monday, as news first began to trickle out of China, and as the government's concerns about the country's food supply began to wane, the official position was that things were getting really scary for the staff of the DVLA. Johnson was, by then, well aware that he was bringing in his reshuffle party chief, after the departure of Dominic Raab, as well as furious about the way the local elections were being played out, with many of the traditionally Conservative voters who turned out in the referendum. There were also fears that the new foreign secretary, Liz Truss, might try to turn the conversation into a political weapon, by making her appear uncomfortable or unrepresentative of the new government. The DVLA was effectively handed the gunplay card on Monday, with the Lib Dems expressing concern that Truss was intervening in the matter so fervently. Johnson's deeply divided cabinet were furious about not being consulted in certain moments of crisis, and some are fretting that Johnson may have become too powerful once his top aide, Andrew Bridgen, and the new foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, take over critical roles. There has been much speculation about what will happen when Johnson does not make his threats of violence necessary to deliver on promises made during the buildup to the Brexit referendum. News about Truss's tax rise accelerated after the Brexit referendum, and have barely come up as he tries toilus his way out of crisis. Johnson's health and social care plan was comfortably passed by MPs on Wednesday, and was comfortably passed by the government on Thursday. However, the government's indecision about what the tax increase will do is partly explain the wide-ranging embarrassment caused by the £20 a week increase in universal credit in the early days of the Brexit transition.  At the time, the prime minister was planning a budget of ""kamikaze"" proportions, and into the future, and that meant cutting the budget ever further. Johnson fancied himself as the masterful curator of cultural memorabilia, but the government's most recent record of making real-terms cuts to welfare was £13bn in the year to March 2020.  When the new health secretary, Sajid Javid, announced that the proceeds of the tax cut will go to help the poorest households, everyone from homeless people to parents, the chancellor directly quoted Matt Hancock's slogan, ""I hate the bit about universal credit why are you getting rid of it when you get rid of it the family hubby?"" Being an orphaned child in a care home made him vulnerable to the isolation and neglect of his older brother and sister. His parents faced no shame about their behaviour during the early days of the pandemic. Being brought up by his brother's parents, he said, ""He didn't do much of the school-age game, but he did make a big impression on the classmates."" Little more than nine years later, however, Hancock says he has a personal issue that Peter Kanani, the health secretary, Michael Gove's new chief adviser, will not readily dismiss as political. ""Angela is very good at distance running, but she doesn't quite deliver the heights of Peter Kanani,"" he says.",Gen Guardian,820.0

There was also a jolt of optimism after the historic vote on vaccine regulations.

But Conservative backbenchers John Redwood and David Cameron boastful politicians have complained that they have a litany of excuses for not having enough control – including the expense of setting up a lab in a foreign county and of course of course of course of course of course – to tackle the virus. And Johnson's relaxed attitude towards the ""yin and yang"" of the pandemic suggests the public are beginning to accept that the ""quad"" of senior ministers who control him as a player – Dr Paul Johnson, who is neither a vaccine guru nor a vaccine guru, and who other days I half-jokingly asked: ""Is everything OK, is everything OK because everybody is racing to get a jab?"" At other times in the week, the prime minister has tended to be more focused on health than politics – so perhaps that is partly to reflect the anaemic mood in the UK. But the sheer scale of the challenge makes it difficult to view this as a favourite, nor would I expect it to be devoid of challenges. The Covid vaccination programme is complex, with the government's own separate advisory paneling upstart Rishi Sunak's institute to make the final decisions about when the programme should shift to a more in-depth understanding of the virus. Johnson's spokesperson Jackie Baillie insisted on Thursday that the prime minister remained 100% committed to the plan for a ""secure, well-funded, and resourced"" response to the pandemic. But Johnson's spokesperson said he remained acutely conscious that the next general election might be at an ""early"" point, when the government's finances are well and truly reformed.

But the Labour leader has added to the growing list of those being urged to stay at home after being refused entry to major venues. Boris Johnson's official spokesperson has insisted that venues with the largest crowds topping up the largest spectator pools were the most likely to have opened the previous month, adding that these groups were particularly likely to be attending weddings or other receptions in crowded indoor venues.  Other notable moves include setting out that venue-based data will be made available on an international performance-science index, and the creation of a new ""tier 4"" entertainment sector controlled by two independent entities. These will allow music venues to compete with museums and galleries, and sports venues to welcome team matches. The creation of such a system will also open up the opportunity for tech companies to showcase their expertise in the sector to potential customers, potentially further increasing the opportunities for the local economy. ""We are pleased to allow admitted sportswitchers to compete with professional matches via the new VIP service, as we accelerate into the winter,"" said the spokesperson, asserting that the scheme would introduce a US$100m (£73m) bioreactors industry.

But the government's own experts have warned that the policy will remain unpopular with some Conservative MPs, who have a hard time tuning in to watch the match.

Winning the Chesham and Amersham byelection would also signal that the Tories have deposed the Corbynite brand which was once regarded as badge of office. Elections sometimes feel self-fulfilling – and in this case, being elected in the Hackney square on Monday night was also proof of that. But by throwing his weight around Cop26 concerns deep in his heart – and after accusing Starmer of ""undermining his rule"", even Starmer's most ardent defenders conceded it would not have happened without the aid of expensive goodwill. Backbench allies claimed as many as 40 letters sent to Starmer's MPs from campaign committee members were the first to suggest they would back a leadership candidate, writing: ""I think he would be a great prime minister to fill the void left by Michael Gove."" Some backbenchers even suggested they might be willing to gamble on a new shadow cabinet member, in the hope that someone fresh out of the shadows could emerge who could match the sharpness of his leadership. Meanwhile, without the draw of an already crowded out shadow cabinet, Cooper's supporters said she would retain the power to set the party's policy agenda, from party conference, and to tell the party's story to the electorate. ""You'll have a really good opportunity to do a Speakers' Debate: you'll have the opportunity to make your case visually and emotionally, tell them the issues you care about them and their families, and get them through this,"" said one frontbencher. ""We'll then have a fully televised debate, with Tweed and fish being pandemics protagonists, with other dramatic accounts."" But few in the parliamentary Labour party believe the expanded role of parliament in Starmer's case should be made available to potential supporters. Despite more than 4,000 of his We the People pledges made during the 2019 general election, many remain pressing for the party to focus more on the public's directly suffering, instead of on taking actionable steps. A spokesperson for the Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, said: ""We support transformative policy that works for all of us. But we must be careful about understatement, because the gap between the lines between different people and their impact is too big. ""We must now accept that living in areas affected by the pandemic is going to be very difficult for some, as those in remote and isolated circumstances. To act in the way we have in Cop26 is not an appropriate response."" The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said on Sunday that the government was hoping Monday would be the ""last day"" for Glasgow City council and urged the public not to be gloomy about news of the cancellation of the council tax increase. ""Celtic is going to be very, very sad news,"" he said on Sophy Ridge. ""Covid is very, very difficult to get wrong. It's a sad state of affairs."" In his NBC interview, Johnson again resisted a repeat of the widely derided pause in trying to resolve the differences between the UK and the EU, insisting he was ""learning from the mistakes"" of the Covid crisis. ""There were a variety of ways of doing this, how to reach different people and to communicate with different people, and to be able to talk about different things without having to find the same thing again,"" he said. The prime minister repeatedly emphasised the importance of the EU maintaining the customs union with the UK, insisting: ""We keep the important things in common, including the fact that we have laws and we act on them. We have an agreement, a protocol, about how we want to operate within the protocol."" He was speaking in Downing Street, not No 10, as it was being heavily tipped towards Friday's final assembly vote. Johnson was speaking in person as he flew in from New York on a government jet, as he pressed ahead with setting out the country's stance as the season approaches. The prime minister had previously stressed the importance of maintaining the ""level headed approach"" that had helped the EU maintain its high levels of connectivity during the pandemic.",Gen Guardian,820.0

Farmers supplying UK exporters with PPE will also be able to expect to be granted final entry to EU member states on Wednesday, the foreign secretary Matt Hancock has said. As a backbencher, Hancock was the latest senior party figure to question the government's approach to managing the pandemic. The failure to take immediate action after a lambasting of Hancock by the MP James Cleverly on the Sunday edition of ITV's Wales Service appeared to suggest the prime minister has a new ""black book"" for government when it comes to dealing with the crisis. When Downing Street was asked on Tuesday whether Johnson had a new ""search and rescue"" strategy, saying it remained to be seen whether he could manage the surge in cases, Hancock said: ""We are simply having a look at this: is there anything we can do to alleviate the burden on the NHS?"" He added: ""Could we be doing something different? Perhaps we can."" The health secretary is also expected to press the government to set up a new, test-and-trace system, to allow people to get their drugs in bulk instead of going through a separate company. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been touring Europe this weekend in the hope of getting a grip on to what he could call the situation in Northern Ireland, where there is ""real potential"" for the virus to be tougher, and to get away from its ""comfort period"". He will meet the new prime minister, Theresa May, in the Oval Office, and will hold a series of meetings with the new health secretary, Sajid Javid, at No 10.  While pessimistic, the health secretary's recent comments about the risks of reopening could give political breathing space for Robert Jenrick to take a crack at lifting the 0.7% tax on imports of Scottish wine.  Speaking to the FT, he said his colleagues in the wine department had made their voices heard. ""We all want to get back to where we want to be, but doing so will require bringing more capital to the wine industry and, crucially, to the wine hubs across the country. ""We have also got to be bolder and bolder in what we're doing – and nobody wants to be blind to what the costliest restrictions will bring,"" he said. Jenrick, who is also the former shadow chancellor, Chris Whitty, is the author of a blogpost calling into question the government's approach to the early days of the pandemic. ""The pandemic was born out of the centre, not the back of it; and the centre didn't just lie in the back of the government,"" he said. ""The virus spread very rapidly through the south, as it did through the north-east. The virus then reached England by air mail, and England was hit particularly hard by the electoral defeat of the last decade. ""The former head of the Licensed Practitioners' Association, David Lidington, recently summed it up quite well in great detail in his excellent book, The Virus and the Health: The Good, the Bad and the Cares."" He called it ""the virus that brought us food banks, our neighbourhood punchbowl and our rave hub"". Perhaps more controversially, he claimed it helped to explain the persistent slogan, ""Get Up Late Brexit"", after the Brexit party stood its ground in the face of furious opposition. Looking forward to 2020, Leigh Rhoy, the co-chair of the leftwing Socialist Campaign Group, who has supported candidates in local elections, said on Twitter that ""if that means we need to, we have got to get up late Brexit."" The MP for Streatham, Jess Phillips, was attacked for announcing a new date for booking a holiday in the UK, hours after the government announced plans to clear up indecency allegations made against a former male masseuse. Rhoy tweeted that he could not support the decision, before citing Johnson's ""sprint"" word. The Speaker of the House of Commons, Lindsay Hoyle, intervened to urge MPs to behave calmly, and tweeted: ""Those of us who don't behave badly need to get ourselves out of this."" Tweedies darling Jess Phillips is regarded as a strong contender for the Christmas card, after her suspension for her role in the national humiliation of 2013. But McSweeney said she was ""scapegoating"" at the scale of the backlash against her last week, which she said appeared to be caused by younger people. ""It's completely up to people's minds.

Vaz announced a full-blown investigation into the events that led up to the events that led up to the Cornish seat being vacated by the murdered MP Jo Cox. His statement reopening was one of the few moves Fordes made during the illness period to remove a member of the public, including MPs Rob Roberts and Diane Abbott, who had called on him to resign. However, critics have pointed out that the decision to bring a peer into the party had already been widely tipped for victory, and that the decision had been blocked by the new leader, Theresa May. Vaz's critics have also highlighted a series of changes made to the parliamentary sleaze bill since he came into power, including the removal of key figures such as the barrister Piers Corbyn.

When it came to the general tax bill on Wednesday, the chancellor flatly refused to consider it to be a separate tax bill. As he arrived in Washington by train from New York, in a rare public appearance since taking over as finance secretary, the prime minister repeatedly and graphically detailed the complex arrangements governing the economy of daily life.  Under the headline ""Budget this year, how we spent our money"", the chancellor accompanied the prime minister on a private jet on Wednesday, and gave him a tour of the new academic college, the UK Inside Schools.  The new college is being created to prepare for a sharp increase in the number of secondary school pupils coming to university in the first waves of the pandemic, as the health secretary, Matt Hancock, weighs up whether to cut school extracurriculars to boost vaccine uptake among the next 35 million. But the government's language has become increasingly cautious in recent weeks in the face of increased concern among scientific advisers about the impact of the fast-moving crisis. The chief medical officer for England said on Thursday that the world had changed, and that the best course of action was to increase the number of groups taking up the offer. ""I don't think the government can ignore the fact that there are already a million people using care homes, and the millions of children in need of help."" In his budget speech on Wednesday, Hancock said the government's aim was to ""make sure that never again will we be in a country of immigrants … we create the conditions for a better future for everyone who comes in, and we nurture the traditions and the networks that hold people together"". He claimed that by that autumn, with 5.5 million choosing to stay in the UK, the number would reach 10.3 million.

849,Generated,The Guardian,"– A cross-party coalition of senior MPs including former president Joe Biden and new trade secretary Liz Truss is keen to widening the coalition's potential votes in the coming byelection contests in the south of England, claiming victories that would put the party on course to lose. Truss, who was a trade secretary under Clinton, has made clear she wants to spark a ""green industrial revolution"", tackling the climate crisis and creating hundreds of thousands of jobs in clean energy. With the next general election likely to be held in 2023 at the earliest, the Labour leader is expected to raise questions about the party's character. After a chaotic 48 hours of briefings and counter-briefings, reports emerged that the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, had been approached by a veteran of the Blair years, who was said to be mulling a comeback. It is understood that he discussed the prospect of a role in a meeting on Friday, with the party's chief whip, Nick Brown, believed to be in place. Meanwhile, the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, is under pressure from within Labour to serve in the dustbowl of government itself, as her hand is often washing off beneath the surface of ill-tempered disbelief. The reshuffle came as Starmer's team were still hammering home the message that he and Angela Rayner were committed to tackling the climate crisis – but the change in the country had been deeply ingrained in Labour long before Starmer took the helm.  One Labour source said: ""There's a drumbeat of sleaze that's happening all the time now, and that drumbeat is becoming harder and harder. It's almost like they've taken the cake: now they're making it to the top."" They cited the case of the former work and pensions secretary James Brokenshire having admitted to MPs last week that he oversaw a series of inappropriate comments, some of which were made to female colleagues and even included a huger character line such as ""Hang on, we love you a bit more!"" – suggesting, for example, that his predecessor Dominic Raab was using the cloak of parliamentary privilege to do his bit for the party. Other recent examples of cronyism include the Conservative MP Owen Paterson's promotion to shadow homes minister in 2013, and the home secretary's job in 2014. However, the clearest recent indication that the Labour party is taking a fresh approach to fundraising came from Labour's West Yorkshire headquarters this weekend, with 400 of the party's dedicated supporters attending the annual party events.

850,Generated,The Guardian,"Unemployment in Northern Ireland has been cut by three percentage points in the past month, the latest official weekly survey of 1,000 adults by the UK government has found, as the economic impact of low-wage outsourcing became a political football.  The survey, used to shape the 2017 EU-Canada trade deal, found that the most Conservative MPs had a majority of 57, enough to override the Brexit majority in a few states. Instead of just waiting until 2022 to make the changes, the Conservatives seized on the idea that workers such as nurses and the well-educated weren't worth the risk, and that leaving too often out of reach was a time-honoured institutionisation of the profit system. As well as wanting to tackle sectors such as work, the Tories also recognise the importance of cutting bureaucracy – and of reassuring the public that things are really getting better, is taking a page out of George Osborne's playbook. Councils lack of effective regulation schemes all too often blame their leaders, and the process by which the prime minister used to hammer home the message that the economy was moving in the right direction only strengthened the sense that it was the people creating the economy – not the firms – who were the beneficiaries of the UK's generous free trade deal. Yet asctors and other healthcare workers are not dissapointed by the numbers, while allies of Starmer have been warning for months about the damaging impact of outsourcing in key sectors. And the recent announcement by the cabinet office that will soon become the government's third annual report describes prospects for a ""Baghdad-only"" winter, with the cold front expected to make its way over to sunny Cornwall over the weekend.  But the government may yet find itself – as so many times during the pandemic –gobbled up by a constituent thread. The wintering, which includes curtailing the use of anti-sleeping drugs, cutting public spending and avoiding costly agreements with EU countries, is a perfect example of this phenomenon happening across the government. Yet government insiders believe the pandemic represents a much wider problem, one that encompasses as well Johnson's deeply divided cabinet.  When discussing the challenge in January, Starmer repeatedly underlined the need for ""hard choices"" to deal with the pandemic in its early days. ""We've come to the point in the past 20 days where hard choices have to be made in order to contain the spread of the virus,"" he said, stressing the need to protect life-and-death choices made by staff. ""We've come to the point in the past 12 months when people need to be careful because sometimes the transmission of the virus is very rapid, and the sphere of their everyday lives is very much wider than we are."" Comme toujours, une même union, une même détermination à agre, said he would not be pinned down on when formalities will be available – but he made clear that he was keen to stick to the political process. ""We are already seeing what he called 'variants of the disease' that are getting better, and which we're trying to control,' he added. He did not specify which variants the government must now take on, however. Lyall said he would not be drawn on new variants of the disease. ""I can't tell you the stories, the stories are the different about Johnson, the data the facts don't match,"" he said. ""You've got the stories about Covid, about the chancellor's statement, and about the resurgence in the vaccination programme. But the story is, the data is not going to match what's currently being worked on in detail, and there's a reason for that. But we'll just have to see what the prime minister says."" Johnson's flexible rota-statements have also ""shifted"" into the promise that they will ""max out at 80% or more"" in some cases, rather than relying on current predictions of 80% or higher. But the government's scientific advisers have become increasingly alarmed about the idea of making it impossible for a once-pitching group of zealots, led by George Osborne, to overpromise, and inadvertently reduce the public's confidence in the country's vaccination programme. The government believes the cap on how many vaccine doses residents can take at a time, which is expected to be announced in the coming days, has set a worrying example for parents. As well as being able to hand out more confidence, the polarity of the notifications means that any impact on cases could easily overwhelm the NHS.

The UK had been sceptical about giving the order more details, but ministers appeared to be about to take the hint when asked about the issue earlier this week in New York. Johnson's official spokesperson was asked repeatedly by a member of staff about a series of questions from a member of the press, one of whom was seated in the back of the plane. The prime minister was standing directly in front of him when he was asked the question. ""Mexico, the UK and Australia all work very closely on the same programme, and you've already seen progress made in the United States and in Europe,"" he said.

After Johnson's remarks about universal credit being ""worth it"", many on the left were keen to know whether his apparent outrage over the government's mishandling of the Northern Ireland protocol was fading. The former shadow chancellor George Osborne echoed that sentiment when he said the UK risked falling behind in the developing world. Johnson's comments about the DUP appearing to have taken on ""any individual who has hoofwear"" also appeared to be dismissed as ""a lost cause"". One seasoned Labour campaigner lamented: ""Boris is going to be very pleased about this, with his boosterish tendency to overpromise and outright lies."" The former shadow chancellor John McDonnell went further, suggesting Johnson had shown ""an unmistakable intention to undo the good work that was done by the last Labour government"". While Dodds' committee chair, Emily Thornberry, was cheered on to sack by Corbyn, many of the same commentators who have praised him throughout the Jeremy Corbyn crisis have dismissed her as completely unnecessary. Despite the febrile mood, a constructive Brexit deal seems unlikely while the government is still in the know about the terms of reference and the low turnout expected from the 2019 general election. Meanwhile, with Conservative rebels warning that they will boycott the cabinet meeting if ministers back off on net zero, Starmer may have alienated a small number of key figures before the parliament erupted in fury. NEC members from all five of the Corbynite factions gathered at Heathrow on Friday for a critical hearing, and witnesses described mask-wearing and loud shouting among party staff. They called for Starmer to be stripped of the whip, along with most senior party officials, for leaking the confidential Department of Health and Social Care report on the social distancing app Threshold, used by millions of people. The whip is highly flexible, with those who breach it the worst case being ordered to repay them immediately. Several senior Labour MPs wereas announced on Saturday evening, with the whip withdrawn over the Department of Health and Social Care scandal.

But the departure of a number of longstanding aides from far more politically perilous fronts may vindicate Starmer's concern about the damage done by the Covid wave, and the potential for epidemics to persist. One senior Tory source said: ""The truth is that directly aligning the leaderships is impossible. The only viable way forward is through a shift to leafy seats like West Yorkshire and the North West, where there is widespread disillusion with the direction of travel and a keen sense that things are not going to get any worse.""  Starmer's team say they are acutely aware that the 2019 general election will be one of the most difficult of the remaining parliament-and-government years, and that preparing for it will take time. And they say they are also optimistic about the prospects for reform – though they are surprised by the scale of the virus justetax challenge. ""We've never really been at war with ourselves. Now, with the right policies, we can make sure that we restore the confidence of the towns and regions that George Osborne said they needed to build an economy 'to be remembered',"" said a ""lieutenants"" group. One senior Tory described Frost's departure as a ""joke"". ""He thought he was enforcing the rules on him, but in fact he's been filling them with his fellow babblers,"" he said with a laugh. The official data suggest the Unite spokesperson conducted 100,000 online tests between 2020 and 2021 – quite likely through the Loyalty New Modurance System, used by companies who hold user data. She tested whether backing out of potentially costly reforms to the social security overhaul while maintaining the party's rule-breaking rule-breaking rule-breakingism was still plausible. ""The poll results are in – and as we indicated in the last step, there are now 40% of the public supported the process,"" he said. ""Now the big question is, do those who are now in power continue to be effective guardians of the rules on behaviour, or do they not?"" He then went on to call the process ""a long way towards the delivery of building blocks for a new economy"", adding: ""We've won the Churchill Amendment, so that's enough for now."" Turnout in the 2019 general election was only just over the 50% legal threshold for triggering article 50, but Starmer's radical reshuffle had already caused alarm among some traditional Tory MPs. The former shadow chancellor John McDonnell has warned that the party's structures are vulnerable to sabotage from outside interests.

One such class action is being brought by former employees of Vote Leave, which Vote Leave believes is rife with conflicts of interest.

The party announced the radical overhaul of the system last month, which was criticised at the time as unnecessary and created a tight circle of senior figures.  The announcement was made as Williams, the new shadow home secretary, spoke about the ""clashes"" between MPs and staff as they dealt with Berry's resignation. The news that Labour was to announce a radical overhaul of the way the social care system is being run hit Chuka Umunna, the party's former adviser, tense on the national crisis. ""I don't like the way he looked at it: 'You took the initiative,' "" said one exasperated Labour staffer. ""He looks at it this way: 'I intend to work with him and get the job done,'"" said another who knows what's expected of the MP. While the Corbynite campaign group Momentum has hammered Conservative MPs for their reluctance to back the government on social care issues, few colleagues think the shake-up is necessary – but some MPs feel it is time to put the brakes on political campaigning. In a joint statement on Tuesday, the two campaigns agreed to look at how the £20 a week uplift could be made possible. ""We can now begin to put the last pieces of the puzzle in place,"" said Johnson's spokesperson. With a majority of MPs Labour could secure the right to elect a deputy leader, but the party's new leader is now the object of jeers from Tory MPs and MPs on the frontline of the pandemic. Keir Starmer attacked Starmer at prime minister's questions this week for failing to make an impact, claim that said Labour had been swept out of the dark days of the reform drive. But Johnson's power over the party is apparently untrammelled. Any plans for a new trade policy were pulled from the agenda in Wednesday's meeting of shadow ministerial keygroups meeting. The shadow cabinet still hopes to push the boundaries of reform in the coming months, including repealing the so-called ""metacarp"" – putting sub-groups on the same footing as their MP cohorts. The shadow cabinet still hopes to push the boundaries of reform in three areas: levelling up, expertising the government on the next wave of tech investment, and bolstering the police presence – something the government is likely to announce at a later date. ""We are confident, based on data, that next week will be the most crucial milestone yet,"" said a Department of Health and Social Care source. The spokesperson for the prime minister did not specify which areas the government would move the most, though he did not rule out closing the social care system altogether. The policy forms part of a wider approach, already under review by the independent adviser on health inequalities, Kathryn Stone. She laid out a five-step levelling-up plan in early March, which she said would allow the public to – under binocular – at least some of the resilience that comes with poverty. Johnson's spokesperson has frequently compared the challenges of the 21 June reopening to the dramatic economic impacts of bombing Syria, citing the need to relieve the public of the ""challenges of filling the void created by the crisis"" and of excavating for a better site.  But in light of the stark differences between the two approaches, some backbench Conservatives are keen to see the prime minister acknowledge his role in the early days of the crisis. Ed Davey, the chair of Conservative backbench MPspeak unit, said: ""This is a good moment to start to acknowledge that he was entirely with the decision-makers in Cabinet Office, and that he was entirely with the parliamentary bodies that signed off on it."" As the health service recorded its strongest single month since the end of last year, however, Conservative MPs sounded empty and predicted a general election would be almost certainly never called. Even before the national mood turned against Boris Johnson, however, there was already a clear threadbare picture of competence – as well as the mounting costs of running a third wave of Covid. Matt Hancock's statement that the government would ""go down in history as a broken promise"" was made before the knotty negotiations had begun, when reporters were calling for comment. When the economy minister, Tobias Ellwood, pressed back against the prime minister's promise of tax cuts or another welfare cut, the prime minister's spokesperson repeatedly sidestepped the question of why such a big deal was necessary. ""There are, you can imagine, the deep issues that this country faces,"" he said, adding: ""There are also the simple facts: that is not an easy decision.""

In a recent vote on preparing for the next ""big thing"" in January, the Lib Dems overturned the majority to attract Patrick Starmer as an challenger. However, his deputy, Angela Rayner – a member of the government's travel select committee – is calling for an infrastructure fund to be created to back social care. Recent research by the consultancy WPI Strategy has suggested the fund could be worth £500m over the next decade. Recent research by the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe hopes to link increased investment in green technologies with a more sustainable environment. Starmer's spokesperson frequently touts hisvy of green technologies, including solar, wind and biofuels. But the Treasury has repeatedly highlighted the difficulties in getting those technologies to market, and the backdrop of a national energy plan. Rishi Sunak was last seen on security grounds in the wake of the publication of the critical draft legislation, which resulted in the cancellation of several government plans. Johnson's spokesperson frequently touts his green credentials – he was born in Leicester and went to school in nearby York, before taking a degree in sociology and a trade degree in Manchester.  He took a one in six on-the-ground exam last month, and has been closely monitoring his performance, given that he took a last-minute lashing from the former Business Secretary Lee Cain. At Wednesday's press conference, Johnson directly challenged Sunak to a maverick phrase: ""do as the Eclipse says!"" – asking him to ""fix what works"". Echoing the message from May, who was then the shadow health secretary, said: ""I believe what the government has done is they have to think very carefully about how they meet the requirements of the brief that they are proposing to give us."" While the plan has received less media attention than many of the plans announced by Sunak, for now it appears to be gaining prominence across the political spectrum. Johnson's spokesperson repeatedly pressed Starmer on the potential downsides of the scheme, including the fact that it could lead to a ""cost-cutting"" problem. ""If we look at what the costs are, and the improvements we've seen, and the gaps in services that we've seen, and the disruption that that has caused, and the age of many people, it is well over a decade. And if we look at what ails us, and the opportunities that we've seen, and the need for action – and the opportunities are there."" Asked if he was concerned about the risks of the plan being introduced imposing fresh restrictions, he said: ""It's a cost-cutting mistake to cut services; it is a misstep to neglect the most essential core of services that people have got to think about this for themselves. ""The age of many people is over, it is time for us to think about the long-term the problem head-on.""

Hodgson, the MP for Washington and Sunderland West since 2010, replaces Carolyn Harris, who resigned earlier this week amid claims that she had stoked up tensions between Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner.  As Starmer's parliamentary private secretary, her job will be to liaise between backbenchers and the leader's office. Some MPs have complained in recent weeks that they felt neglected by Starmer's team. Hodgson will also bring understanding of the north-east, where Labour lost the Hartlepool byelection last week, and the Midlands it lost her own byelection last week. Her intention is to build on the work of Michael Gove, who is a fan of the Labour leader's and has been involved in a number of high-profile decisions. The reshuffle of Starmer's parliamentary private secretary was the latest fallout from the resignation of well-known figures including the chief whip, Andy McDonald, who made significant policy decisions during the pandemic. Travellers are likely to raise questions about Starmer's leadership as well as the direction of his rule-breaking cabinet. The leader's rule for the time being is just that – of breaking election pledges.

The OECD's latest average global tax burden is £68,000, but many of the companies briefed by the OECD on Wednesday suggested it could be much lower, at £44m.  After Wednesday's meeting, Johnson told the prime minister they would discuss the progress of the negotiations and the future of the agreement, including whether to order more jets from low-tax countries. But he insisted no decision had been taken at the summit: insisting ""nothing has changed"". No 10 sources insisted Johnson is still unconvinced the agreement must be implemented, and that it will be tough ""way to go"" on to frustratingly obvious misunderstandings. Cop26 chair Alok Sharma travelled with Johnson to the US, as the UK steps up diplomatic efforts to secure a deal. Johnson will hold a string of bilateral meetings with fellow leaders, and said he would be pressing them about ""coal, cars, trees and cash"".

He said it would be ""premature to discuss details"" and would be ""premature to give an indication of our new relationship"", underlining the fact that it had existed since the transition period. Just three months ago, Johnson said he had not yet decided how he would implement the policy, but it appeared to have been a ""joke"" to avoid having to announce a new air ambulance buy-in period. The policy was examined over a longer period of time, including during the Ukraine crisis, when the government was concerned about the risk of inflation getting out of control if air passenger licensing were to continue to be introduced across many homes. The government was also keen to draw attention to its plans for an ""urgent necessity"", to ensure the country remained within reach of its target of having 100,000 charging stations by the end of the year. The air passenger licensing system, which is being examined across the country, is meant to allow individuals and businesses to avoid the need to pay for a huge new levy to cope with the virus. Gove last week conceded that one in five people in England did not have the vaccine by the end of next month, but insisted the burden of the change had been ""balanced"". The pressure from political analysts about what will happen if the government cannot manage the pandemic on time has left the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, being questioned by Labour MPs about plans to introduce vaccine passports for nightclubs. The Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, who has been pressing for them to be made compulsory, said: ""Vaccination is a key part of protecting the NHS, police and civil servants. It is essential that we are not allowing any part of the government to be dishonest with vaccination.""

Approximately 35% of those surveyed signed a petition writing to the party's chair, Allegra Stratton, to let the name MATURE be the deciding factor in the matter. Starmer's position as health secretary is heavily dependent on the outcome of discussions on behalf of the British Virgin Islands authorities of whether to reimpose lockdown rules in the wake of the G7 summit. The Labour leader has already been approached for a role on behalf of the British Virgin Islands authorities, who are investigating the conduct of Boris Johnson's stay in the UK. Boris Johnson's official spokesperson has so far declined to comment on the case, which has sparked alarm in the royalist plotcong. However, recent leaks about Johnson's financial affairs have also revealed highly embarrassing details about the prime minister's personal life.  Ministers and their close aides have at times been caught on the wrong side of the Atlantic, as they try to avoid judgment after a widely watched BBC interview in which he was directly asked about the leaked report that criticised him for his private life. In the BBC interview, also recorded earlier this week, Johnson was asked about the leaked Equality and Human Rights Commission report on the G7 summit. The commission report found that the UK had promoted groups such as the CBI and the European Research Group (ERC) above its oversight responsibilities. The government is facing a legal challenge to the EHR findings, which were widely viewed as a repudiation of Boris Johnson's role as UK's leading advocate of an EU-wide ""license to practice"". The prime minister was last seen in a tweet sent out on Sunday evening, alongside the slogan ""help the British Virgin Islands prepare for a vaccine rollout"". Johnson had previously denied that he was considering a go-ahead from the government's annexed Covid roadmap, claiming – instead – that the prime minister was merely pointing out the ""vast majority"" of Virgin Islands nationals already wished to settle in the UK. The government is facing a series of legal claims about the invitation, which was sent without consulting the companies that run it. The prime minister himself has tended to be among the more cautious cabinet ministers on questions of transparency, rarely jockeying for job titles or internships. He was forced out of his job as chief whip in Theresa May's government. Questions were also raised about the style of rule-breaking that accompanied the prime minister's fateful, six-hour scramble to get across the Danubian summit – before being whisked to a mansion in May through awan-Covid visa. Johnson's official spokesperson has insisted the prime minister remained ""100% committed to the path he wrote & carried out chosen throughout"". Johnson was recently plagued by a string of scandals, most notably the furlough scandal, which put him in power without any formal declaration of intention to power. But he was, and remains, in a difficult position as the state of affairs in the EU, where a rebellion by Brexiters could undermine attempts to sideline the public. The EU's point-man on EU communications, Maroš Šefčovič, had suggested last week that the public could attend a ""pause in the growth of the flu'', allowing two days to discuss the progress of the campaign before trying to arm themselves for the autumn. The Department for International Trade (DIT) has produced a routine flow of prototypes during the festive period, and the UK is expected to spend £5bn on a legal defence so far. The DIT has also produced a series of reports on the potential impact of the coronavirus pandemic on coronavirus-19. All this makes it a blunter and more revealing document than reports of a previous coronavirus pandemic, which also claimed the life of David Cameron. But it appeared carefully to spell out the government's intentions throughout on Tuesday. As Boris Johnson set out this week's autumn and winter plan on Tuesday, the government will start to unravel as the pandemic exploits many of the vulnerabilities in existing vaccination programmes. It is expected to start the year with a significantly higher death rate than last year's. At the same time, however, the weaknesses in the vaccination programme mean the government is likely to be able to come up with some inspirational new vaccines in the coming months.
