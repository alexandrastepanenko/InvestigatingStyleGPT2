<|startofarticle|>  - The Shadow Home Secretary has launched a major publicity drive to hit back at Tory MPs who voted to lock up black Brits in lockups The shadow home secretary has launched a major publicity drive to hit back at Tory MPs who voted to lock up black Brits in lockups. Ms Rayner said: "In the week of May the black community has had enough. Tens of thousands of people have died disproportionately and suffering from long periods of institutional racism. "The Conservative Government has done nothing to deal with this issue head-on. Instead of cracking down we have to listen to the black community we have had enough and act appropriately." Ms Rayner said that 48% of the black population were in prison for some offence, compared with 63% of white people. "The Conservatives do nothing to deal with this issue head-on. Instead of cracking down we have to listen to the black community we have had enough and act appropriately." Shadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds will bring in the controversial 'Hands on, Don't Call Me By' policy, which banned the wearing of face coverings from home. Bereaved families of victims of crime said the announcement was a "shameful moment" for the bereaved families of victims of crime. Bereaved families of victims have been crying out for justice in these past few weeks. It is so sad that in the week since the murder of Sarah Everard we have seen a shocking development.  Some families have been allowed to hide, others have been forced to marry a stranger.  And some have been forced to vote.  Just last week I helped a murdered teenager hide in a hotel.  I've lost someone close to me who has voted recently.  And I've lost a friend to this crime as well. "These people are murderers, rapists and stalkers, and it's no wonder the streets are turning up dead spaces. "We don't care who we root for, we care about our city." Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, told the Mirror: "I welcome the recognition of the life and work of a young woman who has survived violent crime. "This is a moment to acknowledge the remarkable work that has been done by the police and the courts over the last 20 years. "We do need clear guidelines around the wearing of face coverings in public, and I know many of you support this agenda. "I will be sure to work with the Mayor on a solution." The capital has spent the last decade strengthening its defences against the deadly spread of the virus and ensuring people's lives are saved. In his speech at the party's conference in Brighton, Mr Starmer promised Labour would again be a patriotic, pro-business party that took care with taxpayers. His commitment has been undercut by the bruising defeat of his pro-business New Health Funding, tax-cut plans and the chaotic withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan. In the Labour-held seat of Batley, where Batley City Council is located, Mr Starmer told the Mirror: "We've got a new generation that has grown up with very different expectations of what their future will hold and they are watching all that disintegrate in front of their eyes. "They have no idea how scared and disappointed they are with the country they have been raised about for so many years." He added: "Barely a week goes by without a story about how terrible it is for our city and for our community in particular. "Things are not looking good for our schools. Schools are not learning the lessons that they have been taught throughout their lives. "Things are not looking good for the NHS. People are not being paid and are being let down by the system." Writing in the Mirror, Mr Starmer said: "Boris Johnson has destroyed trust in the NHS and rightly so. "He has abandoned the NHS workforce, offering them pay and conditions that are not being delivered at their full potential. "If the Government is serious about delivering on the NHS's priority to date, it is time to end the reliance on contractors and support for the NHS that has been a huge financial lifeline for Boris Johnson." The Labour leader said contracts had been awarded to some of the country's biggest companies for waste management and "watered down" workers had been let go. "Last year, Blackrock received a cash compensation package worth £6.9m," he said. "The company's former chief executive was given a £2.5m pay rise and pay until 2019 research and development costs will increase by £5.9m and salary by 4.3%". Mr Starmer said the company's failure to sufficiently fix the problem had put thousands of jobs at risk. "This Budget did nothing to deal with the spiralling number of jobs," he said. "Our incompetence doesn't bode well for a string of years of contraction." Last week, the NAHT announced it would not be referring the dispute to the IOPC for further investigation. That is currently sitting. Earlier this week,

<|startofarticle|>  The Government has made clear it expects schools, in particular primaries, to be the very last thing that closes in the event of further restrictions  Education chiefs have insisted delivering on target for Covid vaccine restrictions would be "difficult" after pupils were told they could expect to spend up to a third of their education from June 2021. Downing Street has insisted it is "very very important" that pupils spent "as much as they possibly can" on instruction before July 19 - and that it would be "very important" that they did so in person. But Mr Johnson's own teachers' union, theSEIU, warned that the deal "makes no sense" and that he would lose public money. The union's Bobby Morton said: "Keir needs a real break from the platitudes and gimmicks of education. "A real education about the importance of intention to improve, and the need to invest in teachers' unions, is the single most important thing that drives our economic performance." The union leader added: "The Government is learning that teachers are the engine of the child's life course. "Not only do they give children the best chance of reaching the next level of learning, but they also provide a massive boost to the economy, supporting community provision and economic development." The union leader added: "The Government is not listening to parents and treating children as if they were a threat, rather than learning from their experience and delivering on our ambitious plans." The deal is so damaging that Sir Geoffrey visited schools in Bolton and Sheffield Wednesday night to find them closing in January. When he arrived, his staff were already working hard to clear desks and set up pick-up points. He even had to take his staff for an MRI which showed the same problems. When asked how they were doing, he just said: "We're doing great." But rather than apologise, he could not decide whether to be optimistic or angry. He said: "We haven't really got a plan in place to deal with the fallout from the pandemic and we are very much not getting one. "The Government is playing catch-up, trying to protect kids through the classroom, by not having one." The Mirror understands that the union chief added: "The bit that's missing from the minister's speech is not really saying what is happening. "He's not going to put it in the speech now."

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want a return to the bubble system in England - but accepted compulsory face coverings in class could make a comeback Secondary school pupils could be told to wear face-masks in school once again to keep Covid at bay this winter, the Education Secretary has admitted. Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want to see the return of bubbles where whole classes or year groups were sent home after a positive test. But he admitted that compulsory face-masks in lessons could make a come-back if cases spike. "I've got a contingency plan, as you would expect me to do. It contains lots of contingencies, including masks, absolutely," he told Sky News. The mandatory wearing of face coverings in schools and colleges was scrapped in May, but Government guidance says that directors of public health could advise schools to reintroduce them if cases spike. It comes after Government figures showed the number of children out of school for Covid-19 related reasons in England increased by two thirds in a fortnight. The DfE estimates that 2.5% of all pupils - more than 204,000 children - were not in class for reasons connected to coronavirus on Thursday last week. This is up from 122,300 children, or 1.5% of all pupils, on September 16 - a 67% rise from two weeks ago. Mr Zahawi also defended the slow rollout of carbon dioxide monitors which were first promised by the Department for Education in August. In Wales, secondary school and college pupils will be advised to take daily lateral flow tests for seven days if someone in their household tests positive for coronavirus, the Welsh Government has announced. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Zahawi said he was concerned about the impact Covid-19 measures had on attendance. He said: "The good news is that - and thanks to the brilliant teachers and support staff and parents and children - 99% of schools are open. "Attendance has gone up, the last set of figures I looked at was about 90%, which obviously will fluctuate depending on infection rates. "But my priority is to protect education, keep those schools open." But he said he was not looking to return to the bubble system to do so, "because actually, you saw the fall off in attendance which really does harm mental wellbeing and mental health of children". That is despite Englnad's schools previously being told backup plans must "cover the possibility that in some local areas it may become necessary to reintroduce 'bubbles' for a temporary period, to reduce mixing between groups. "Any decision to recommend the reintroduction of 'bubbles' would not be taken lightly and would need to take account of the detrimental impact they can have on the delivery of education."

<|startofarticle|>  The Mirror has learned the former Tory work and pensions secretary faces a Number 10 slapdown after revelations she has been a key architect of Tory cuts to welfare. Boris Johnson faces angry calls to finally face the facts after furious public debate over massive backpayments to cronies. The Prime Minister has been warned that more than £100bn will be cut from the £170bn pledged to help those in work. But the money is no longer tied to government contracts and is allocated to fill government roles rather than to actually do work for the people of this country. No 10 faces internal divisions over the extent of the betrayal and the extent of the betrayal of public trust over the conduct of ministers and officials. There are deep and abiding questions over the course of this Government's premiership whether it is time to revisit the above-mentioned scandals or return to normal. For much of the last year, Labour has been critical of the Government's failure to manage the pandemic and its impact on public services. They have accused it of being "corrupt" and "indoctrinating" while attempting to blame Labour's devastating result on the decisions of just 1.6m nurses. The Government has also argued that the pandemic has deprived the city of its most vulnerable population - children. But Mr Starmer has argued that bringing in extra nurses and helping children who had been in isolation was a "retrograde step". He argued that Labour had failed to demonstrate that it had a plan for nursing the country out of lockdown for years. "We've not won the public's trust yet," he said.

<|startofarticle|>  Starmer faces calls to bolster caution and to reassure voters they are sticking with the laws Boris Johnson has been urged to stick with the law after a major poll for the Government showed the polls closed the Government's biggest poll losers have been told they are facing "vigorous competition from Brussels". Boris Johnson said the EU would "have a role" in Britain's relations with the EU Despite months of threat from Brussels to strike a trade deal with the European Union, the Prime Minister admitted the EU has "some" concerns over Britain's commitment to keep going with the £20 a week it pays for its TV licence. EU diplomats have been getting ready to negotiate a new "freedom of movement" agreement for British citizens since last week. Mr Johnson told Sky News: "The EU would have a role in our trade deals, we have some concerns. "But we also have some concerns about the fact that the border is being clogged and we have to deal with some of the gaps." He insisted that Britain could join the EU's ambitious Northern Ireland strategy but that it would be "foolhardy" to assume Brussels will give us "a free pass" to do so. "We want to have a trade deal with the EU that says we can't negotiate in Northern Ireland because we've got some of the worst health and safety problems," he said. "We need a trade deal that says we can't negotiate in Northern Ireland because we've got some of the worst welfare problems." He insisted that Britain could join the EU's ambitious Northern Ireland strategy but that it would be "foolhardy" to assume the US President Joe Biden would direct the US to do so. "I would love to be President of the United States, but the odds are not in my favour," Mr Johnson said. "In order to do that,we have got to deal with some of the gaps and weaknesses in the current arrangements". He claimed the EU had "some" problems with the UK's Northern Ireland strategy which could be why the UK could not join it. But the PM's spokesman insisted he would make a decision within 72 hours - even if the EU hadn't given its blessing. "At that point" as scientists predicted it would be "almost three years since we'd be treated to a Brexit that really does damage our relationship with the EU", Mr Starmer said. "We've still got a lot of work to do. We're still a long way from that point where we needed to be both more secure and more prosperous. "But the point is that point is now." He added: "What I'm not talking about is rejoining the EU - that's not going to cut it. What I'm not talking about is voting for it. I'm not talking about leaving the EU - that's not going to cut it. I'm not talking about voting for it." Mr Starmer faces pressure from the left and right on his economy and immigration issues as he attempts to move Labour on from the damaging fall-out of last week's elections. After a difficult few days, he announced he was quitting after the party was lost. But Labour. com did not boo: "No, Jeremy, is not going to Anji Marshall's coronavirus!" One said: "This is laughable. Instead of throwing stones, proper candidates are coming to clean up this shambles." And one said: "He's the leader who got Labour and Tory votes, who has the guts to be Labour's leader." But Mr Starmer faces fury from the left for rejecting the one-term government of Tory leader Mr Starmer, who took over the party a year ago this weekend. In a short speech to the party's conference, Mr Starmer said he had "no doubt" there will be "no more weeks like these" and that he would "do the same again" if asked. He said: "What I'm not talking about is rejoining the EU, what I'm not talking about is ripping up the current agreement and re-establishing a new one. "That's not what this Government is talking about." He added: "The PM is correct in his belief that there will be no more weeks like this. That doesn't make any sense at all." Mr Starmer refused to say whether he would accept Labour's demands for a fourth vote in the row over the Government's handling of the pandemic. His deputy said: "MATTHEW KIRSI was right on 37. "No, it doesn't make any sense." The Labour leader faced calls to cut his TV time at this week's conference with David Cameron and Health Secretary Matt Hancock. He said he was quitting to pursue his dreams for a more open NHS. The Labour MPs said: "Trying to rewrite history is not the way of winning. It is not the way of winning here." Mr Starmer faces pressure from the left for being soft on crime and for sticking to the manifesto commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income

<|startofarticle|>  Shadow schools minister Peter Kyle has said the Government will 'not be shy' about announcing new restrictions Boris Johnson has been warned that schools will be a "safety net" for students as Christmas comes to a nadir. The Prime Minister has been warned that Christmas will be forced to wait for more serious cases to emerge. Shadow schools minister Peter Kyle told the Mirror that there will be "no more than a temporary lull". The Government has promised that children returning to school in England will face a "closer look" after they complete a set of exams last year. But Minister Ofcom said last week that there would be a "temporary" lull in class results as the number of cases of Covid rising across the country. Mr Kyle said: "Next week, we have a chance to restore school standards and wellbeing to a new level. "We have every intention of doing so. But we are not prepared for the levels of Covid we had last year." Mr Kyle added: "The truth is, we have had several catastrophic air raids in the last week, causing significant harm to children and large numbers of people missing school. "The only feasible way we could avoid that is if we can get a combination of strict Covid and vaccination." Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  Labour faces a huge challenge hanging onto the West Midlands mayoralty after historic by-election results are in David Cameron is "not conceding" to his "irreparable consequences" if Labour loses the Batley and Spen by-election. The Prime Minister admitted that his position on a third vote to award the West Yorkshire seat was "one of integrity and solidity" because the result was "unacceptable" . He also revealed he had spoken to his deputy Angela Rayner about the by-election result and was "reassured" that she "wouldn't resign". In a devastating verdict on his handling of the pandemic, he claimed that "sick pay" in the UK was a "real disgrace" and that "sick people in this country" counted less than US co-workers. Tory MPs slammed the BBC's decision as "morally wrong" and said it was "beyond belief" that the Prime Minister was prepared to walk away from the UK. Labour's Shadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy urged the PM to "come clean" with the British people on the issue of sick pay and the impact on workers. She told the Mirror: "The Government's betrayal of the British people is befitting a Prime Minister who has presided over one of the worst economic and public health failures in the history of the UK's Government." Mr Johnson's humiliating climbdown over Commons sleaze allegations will be felt across the country. Tory MP Kirsten Oswald added: "This Government is going to have to do a lot more to get us out of this mess." Confirmed Labour 's Lisa Nandy missed out on a handful of by-election wins in the West Midlands as she attempted to build up her side of the party's battered battered party. She admitted Labour still had "a mountain to climb" after its devastating defeat under Jeremy Corbyn to be in a position to oust the Tories from power. Ms Nandy claimed that "scaremongering" tactics from the Tories could "take the Tories back into Government". She added: "I don't think there is any doubt that in today's Britain we need a leader who is prepared to take on the Government and the Conservatives and put an end to the Tory bubble." Ms Nandy dismissed Labour's strategy of attacking Boris Johnson as "bit by bit bit" as the lack of a Plan B. In a manic meeting of theParty's top five, she admitted that plans for a Plan B had "not been laid down". She claimed that the Government had failed to "engage" with school children in the space of two months. The Education Secretary admitted that it was "time to step back" and reverse the cuts made to schools and said the Government had failed to provide for them. In the Commons, Mr Johnson told MPs: "As the chair of the Royal College of Education, I have always been a supporter of the independence of children from all over-racism and white Britishness. "But during this pandemic, the very fabric of British life was being torn between white Brits going home from school feeling like they were in a foreign country and black people. "I want to see a concentration on black and Asian children. "I want to see a kind of black-and-white Britain. You can't have both." But when pressed on whether Labour should back the removal of racial discrimination barriers, he said: "No, I don't think that's what this vote is about. "It's not about removing barriers, it's not because we haven't gone further, it's about maintaining them." He insisted that Labour's only route back to government was through the legislative process. "We need to be able to move through the legislative process without fear of racial discrimination," he said. "That's what this referendum was all about. "We are not going back into Government with a wave of the hand, we are going to be out of Government." But Mr Johnson's opposition Labour has claimed that the party had to change as the result of the last general election was "nowhere near". There was further blow for the Government as election results were still being worked out today. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said: "I'm concerned that the Government's message has been drowned in tragedy. "Tens of thousands of children have lost their lives to this virus and we have to every day be honest about what we're doing for them and for what we're doing for them." She added: "I'm worried that this Government will continue to deliver on their promise of a Plan B even after they've got the Plan C changed up." Plan A includes a vaccine plan, including a vaccine for imported vaccines, for which there is no Plan D. Plan B includes a vaccine plan, including a vaccine for Sri Sridar as the Indian variant spreads through the UK and other countries. Mr Johnson told the House of Lords that there is "no Plan B" and that he would follow the advice of his scientists. He told MPs the Government

A Mirror investigation found that one in ten staff has been infected with a Covid case in London during the past six months. The number of cases is expected to grow as the Government expands the number of supply visas for the holidaymakers. Ministers are said to be concerned about the impact on tourism which has a £180bn backlog due to visa shortages. The Mirror also revealed how the Covid passport programme is facing challenges. It comes as the UK faces an "uncertain" winter as it tackles both flu and Covid-19 according to the Prime Minister. Boris Johnson faces pressure from the public to save face masks amid fears they will undercut his vain efforts to reassure the public of safety. The Health Secretary has told the Mirror that he has a plan for government contracts which would require masks on public transport. He has also said he had a "lot of experience" with the controversial Greensill tartrate vaccine. Mr Johnson told Sky News: "There are a lot of different things that can go wrong with the vaccines. We've seen there's a lot that can go wrong with the manufacturing of the vaccine and so on. "We have to move into the manufacturing phase where we can be mass-producing the vaccines and then we can be mass-filling the vaccines manufacturing phase." He added: "I know there are a number of steps that have to be taken, but on the ground that is not possible right now." Mr Johnson told Sky News: "If we do have to take further measures, we are going to have to proceed according to the facts recommended by the British Medical Association and we will have to proceed according to the scientific advice we have received. "Of course, we will look at the evidence and we will look at the protocols." He said: "The Government knows that we must proceed according to the facts recommended by the British Medical Association and we will continue to work with the Government on ways to make sure that we have followed the rules properly." But No 10 faces criticism for trying to shift the blame onto Brussels when it was fully aware of the commitments required by the deal. The PM said: "We're going to be able to tell the British people exactly how we want to do things." But the EU and US President Joe Biden were not at the talks in New York and did not attend the event in person. Mr Johnson also failed to attend a No 10 briefing which was due to take place on Thursday. Instead, he briefed the public on his new security plans for the UK which he unveiled ahead of Thursday's vote. The Prime Minister said: "The pandemic is here to stay." He claimed that "no country in the world" was going to tolerate the spread of the virus and that Britain would do "whatever we can to help" the countries affected by the pandemic. He had also claimed that "zombie" vaccines being brought in from Europe would not make it into the UK. Mr Johnson told Sky News: "European countries are going to have to behave more carefully than we do". He claimed that the "UK just happens to be the biggest exporter" of the mutant strain, with claims that the EU could not yet meet its target of bringing 20 million vaccinated Brits into the UK. He insisted that tariffs - measures that could be imposed on imported vaccines - would not stop the flow of vaccine seekers. But the PM faces fury from Brussels over a decision last week which could have saved thousands of lives. Brussels officials said they had no plans to impose new tariffs on UK exports but insisted that pharmaceutical firms would have to abide by them. Mr Johnson told Sky News: "We are going to assess the situation and work with them." They asked each country to come up with a plan to achieve that. Germany said it had to find a way of hitting Europe's vaccines while the US said it had to reach its "cautious approach" to the issue. But Scots Tory leader Douglas Ross has said the EU had a "serious and legitimate argument" to be making the jab compulsory. Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want a return to the bubble system in England - but accepted that it was time to change the system to make it easier for pupils to catch up on lost learning Nadhim Zahawi has accepted the call to give youngsters 'active duty' status rather than a three-month extension - but insisted that it would not be the same as being on a ventilator. The Tory education secretary admitted that it would be "very difficult" for him to do the same with sick children. The current system has parents sending their kids to a ventilator rather than on their own furlough which could be a problem. The Government has said that 3.5 million workers in the NHS, law-enforcement and other government agencies are eligible for furlough - but ministers have said that would be expanded to cover all employees of all public and private firms. Mr Zahawi told MPs: "Yes, of course we will have that available to parents and teachers, but they will be offered the opportunity to extend the furlough as a matter of urgency rather than cashing in on it for nothing." But Mr Zahawi was unable to say when the extension would happen. "We will talk about it. We will talk about it. We will talk about it. The point is that we do want to do that, but we will not do it in a vacuum," he said. "We will do it in a way that is affordable for the taxpayer and that is appropriate for the people that are actually subsidising it." Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  The Mirror has learned the former attorney general missed voting while in Mauritius this week despite facing growing criticism for being abroad while Parliament is sitting Under-fire Sir Geoffrey Cox this week missed yet more Commons votes from abroad - this time from Mauritius more than 6,000 miles from Britain. Sources in the island nation told the Mirror the former attorney general was on a "short business trip" there and "met with quite a few people" for meetings. The former attorney general is a partner in an international law firm, Thomas More International Ltd, based in the country, which is in the Indian Ocean. Sir Geoffrey is believed to have left Mauritius, with which he has long-standing links, on Tuesday night meaning he missed at least two days when Parliament was in session. While he was away, MPs voted four times on two separate bills - telecommunications and sewage - but he was paired with an Opposition MP for them all meaning he had permission to be absent. Sir Geoffrey, who has not broken any Commons rules by voting from Mauritius and is likely to have had the blessing of the Tory chief whip, has been approached for comment. It comes after Sir Geoffrey faced criticism for working as a legal advisor in the British Virgin Islands for several weeks earlier this year while the Commons was sitting. While his trip to the Caribbean did not break any rules, he has been reported to the standards commissioner after footage emerged of him taking part in later hearings from his Commons office. MPs are banned from using their Parliamentary offices or resources for outside work. Shadow Commons leader Thangam Debbonaire blasted: "What on earth must Geoffrey Cox's constituents think? "He is meant to be representing them but instead habitually misses days and days of parliamentary time putting his business interests first. "The Prime Minister must make Geoffrey Cox choose between putting his constituents first or his own interests." The top-flight QC has been at the centre of a new sleaze storm after earning more than £1m from legal work in the last year. He clocked in 22 hours a week on average - on top of his £81k job as a Tory MP. Mr Johnson has refused to condemn Sir Geoffrey, arguing that it would be "inappropriate" for him to comment on his case. He even argued MPs having second jobs "has actually strengthened our democracy" by bringing outside experience to Westminster.  But he added: "If that system is going to continue today, then it is crucial that MPs follow the rules" including putting the job of an MP first. Sir Geoffrey visited the British Virgin Islands in April and May this year - 4,000 miles away from his Devon seat - and cast Commons votes remotely from there while doing legal work. He had the permission of chief whip Mark Spencer, already under fire over the Owen Paterson scandal, to vote by proxy while Parliament was sitting. While his trip to the Caribbean did not break any Commons rules, footage has now emerged of Sir Geoffrey taking part in later hearings on September 14. MPs are banned from using their Parliamentary offices or resources for outside work but the video appears to show Sir Geoffrey in an office in Parliament. At one point he gets up, only to tell the hearing later: "Forgive my absence during some of the morning - I'm afraid the bell went off."  This is thought to refer to the division bell, which rings loudly across Westminster to alert MPs and peers that they are needed to vote. Records suggest Sir Geoffrey appeared in a corruption inquiry on behalf of the British Virgin Islands government on eleven separate days the Commons sat this year. There were three in May, two in June, two in September and four in October.  Some were in person on a trip to the Caribbean tax haven - while most were virtual after his return to the UK.  By comparison, he has spoken just once in the Commons chamber in the last 18 months. The top Tory had been reported to the standards watchdog by Labour's Angela Rayner who said the alleged use of the office appeared to be "an egregious, brazen breach of the rules". She has written to standards commissioner Kathryn Stone asking her for "guidance on beginning a formal investigation on this matter". But Sir Geoffrey put out a bullish statement saying he "does not believe he breached the rules" - and that he would cooperate with the investigation. Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  The shadow foreign secretary has said the Government must "reopen" discussions with the Taliban - asking them to urgently set up their own safe zone in Kabul. The Opposition has called for an international co-ordinated response to be launched now to establish if Canberra is really prepared. The Taliban have said they will not "toughen up" the deal - which they claimed would allow for more disruption to elections. A spokesman said: "The Foreign Secretary has been asleep at the wheel since the chaotic withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. "The UK will work with our European partners and friends to ensure those who supported us advance with dignity. "Our fleet of patrol boats is fast approaching the Afghan border, ready to take our people and treasure. "The Americans are bombing, and now we are facing a new chapter. The Taliban are taking over. Who knows how long it will take for the Americans to calm down." The Taliban says it will not tolerate the attacks from terrorists and has been ready to use force in the past. But the British Government has pushed the issue to avoid a hard border reaction with the Taliban. The issue threatens to overshadow next week's NATO summit in Glasgow with claims Britain could not refuse entry to French citizens leaving the country. Britain does not accept the existence of a Magic Johnson island in the South China Sea which the Americans are conducting deep-water trials of submarines. Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want a free pass for MPs to vote as a result of the restrictions ’s family planning rules ’s ban on maternity and child rearing A Government that continues to uphold the damaging claims made by those claiming credit for the Brexit referendum have been accused of being "soft on crime". Shadow education secretary Nadhim Zahawi said: "Hard-working people in this country deserve to know that they are treated with dignity and respect. "But we are still awaiting details on the schemes to help those in power, including the number of 'working people' we will be able to target in our negotiations with them." The Tories have promised a "next generation' workers' state agency will enable workers to more quickly and directly challenge claims of structural racism. But Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was accused of "unfair" and "premedial" trade-union talks. He is expected to announce new recruitment rules for Unite earlier this month. A K-12 union spokesman said: "The Tory agenda contains no plan for tackling the barriers to decent, decent education, to secure a decent life for British children. "Rather it is a script of cuts, concessions and concessions that benefit just wealthy donors and special interests." Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  The Mirror has been told that Boris Johnson has cleared his diary today for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team  – despite months of Tory blunders ’s disgraceful record in office Boris Johnson has apologised for his "reckless" handling of the Covid pandemic, MPs have claimed. A series of fiercely private meetings were held over the course of just the two days before the Prime Minister announced plans to review lockdowns in England. Ministers face angry calls to explain away their mistakes and for the Prime Minister to apologise. In the week since the Mirror revealed the meetings, which took place last week, he has behaved as though he doesn't really understand the rules around their briefing. The Prime Minister met his Cabinet for only one day on Tuesday while they were both studying in the UK, and while they were both working in the NHS. While his first meeting took place on Tuesday, his second was also just today and will be discussed at future meetings. One said: "He's having some of the meetings, he's coming to see us and talking to us". What is your take on this? Prime Minister Johnson has cleared his diary today for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team. They will be asked to appear at a joint committee of the House of Commons and Lords to come up with a solution to the Government's funding crisis. Sources say the PM has already sowed confusion over the exact details of the plans when he was unable to say what steps would be required to help the most vulnerable. He instead told the public to "go back to your classrooms" and asked to be told to "learn from your teachers" after being unable to say how to assess pupils in a "systematic waste of time" situation. Mr Johnson began his first term in Government with a 2.3-million-seat majority which showed that he could not be bothered to follow through on his manifesto commitment. Government insiders claim the PM continued to deny that he had held back on his promise when he refused to bring in a vaccine regulator. He told the Mirror: "Last week there were no structural gaps in the vaccines plan. There were no decision trees. "There were no plans or figures to deliver the vaccine. There was never any plan or evidence to understand what was going on." He added: "I don't think anybody could withhold a moment to take responsibility for the whole of society if they didn't want to deal with this virus." Mr Johnson told Sky News he was "hugely proud" of his Labour team for "fighting" to get him a vaccine despite claims from right-wingers that he was "weak". He insisted that, unlike his Tory predecessor, there was no need for "corrections or whitewash" after the pandemic. In his speech in the West Midlands, Mr Johnson said: "We've got to deal with the root causes of where we are and how we can protect ourselves. "That is why I am absolutely focused on saving thousands of lives a year, not just with vaccine passports but also with our international reputation and standing as a world leader on the world stage. "I know many will welcome the increased investment that has been made into the NHS and social care over the last year or so, but we need a vaccine passporting plan before we can do anything else." The Government has already announced that UK nationals will not need to travel to most European countries for a jab - including Canada, Spain, and Greece. But former PM David Cameron was asked on Thursday what was most important to him as he vented his frustration with the lack of oxygen in the Government. He replied: "Winning. Winning a general election. "Winning. Winning a Greek election. That is what we're focused on." He refused to say whether he would welcome more restrictions on his power to ban people from leaving the country - including from the EU. Mr Johnson told Sky News: "What I would do is if there was a situation in which there was a situation in which restrictions were not being used properly and we needed to intervene properly to try and reverse those." He claimed that getting restrictions down the pike was "not easy" and said the Government was "not going to sit down and talk to" the Irish government over the issue. However, he was unable to shy away from saying that Euro 2016 was "only a matter of time" if the EU does not agree to "establish a safe haven" for refugees over the border. EU diplomats believe that the programme will conclude on Friday as the leaders of the post-Brexit member states meet in Brussels for a Cobra meeting. But Mr Johnson faces fury from Tory backbenchers over his decision to unilaterally suspend the flow of British lorry drivers with links to the lorry fire services as Tory MPs demanded the Cabinet Secretary reinstate a law criminalising breach of contracts. He has already faced demands from Tory backbenchers for an additional statute outlawing abusive bosses who fire Tory MPs. Labour has published a demand for the

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want a return to the bubble system in England - but accepted compulsory face coverings in class could make a comeback Secondary school pupils could be told to wear face-masks in school once again to keep Covid at bay this winter, the Education Secretary has admitted. Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want to see the return of bubbles where whole classes or year groups were sent home after a positive test. But he admitted that compulsory face-masks in lessons could make a come-back if cases spike. "I've got a contingency plan, as you would expect me to do. It contains lots of contingencies, including masks, absolutely," he told Sky News. The mandatory wearing of face coverings in schools and colleges was scrapped in May, but Government guidance says that directors of public health could advise schools to reintroduce them if cases spike. It comes after Government figures showed the number of children out of school for Covid-19 related reasons in England increased by two thirds in a fortnight. The DfE estimates that 2.5% of all pupils - more than 204,000 children - were not in class for reasons connected to coronavirus on Thursday last week. This is up from 122,300 children, or 1.5% of all pupils, on September 16 - a 67% rise from two weeks ago. Mr Zahawi also defended the slow rollout of carbon dioxide monitors which were first promised by the Department for Education in August. In Wales, secondary school and college pupils will be advised to take daily lateral flow tests for seven days if someone in their household tests positive for coronavirus, the Welsh Government has announced. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Zahawi said he was concerned about the impact Covid-19 measures had on attendance. He said: "The good news is that - and thanks to the brilliant teachers and support staff and parents and children - 99% of schools are open. "Attendance has gone up, the last set of figures I looked at was about 90%, which obviously will fluctuate depending on infection rates. "But my priority is to protect education, keep those schools open." But he said he was not looking to return to the bubble system to do so, "because actually, you saw the fall off in attendance which really does harm mental wellbeing, mental health of children". That is despite Englnad's schools previously being told backup plans must "cover the possibility that in some local areas it may become necessary to reintroduce 'bubbles' for a temporary period, to reduce mixing between groups. "Any decision to recommend the reintroduction of 'bubbles' would not be taken lightly and would need to take account of the detrimental impact they can have on the delivery of education."

<|startofarticle|>  Home Secretary Priti Patel and MPs on the far-right European People's party have set up a new bloc to target the far-right in the EU  MPs have set up a new "European People's party" to challenge the "rubs salt in the wound" campaign over the EU. The "Grand Alliance" of anti-racism movements is gathering steam since the Macron election victory. It wants to ban EU citizens from the UK living in "hotspots" who can be "enshrouded" from customs checks and "investigated" by customs officials. The proposals would be subject to a citizen's consent procedure and, if deemed "problematic", they could be removed. The position papers also suggest the EU could impose "foul contracts" on Brits who fail to meet travel and medical bookings rules. The move is under review by the Government after Health Secretary Sajid Javid rejected it. The EU's own travel 'green list' said people should not have to isolate for 10 days for a green. But passengers have been flustered at checkpoints as officials have ordered people to stay at home. The Government is said to be concerned about the impact on travel the change will have on people's immunity. It is hoped officials will be able to bring the move across the House after all the support given to the vaccine roll-out. But Mr Javid's move could also face a backlash from Tory backbenchers. Tory MP Nigel Mills branded the move "irresponsible" as it was meant to be taken up by the PM's wife. Labour MP Carolyn Harris said it was "one more step on the road to disaster". Tory MSP Falcon Lewis claimed the Government was right when it said that EU citizens could be "investigated and punished as crimes committed by the state". She added: "It is highly irresponsible and reckless"

The move to take EU citizens into custody would be "an appalling decision-making step", Boris Johnson has said. The Prime Minister was accused of "more chaos and confusion" after being unable to say exactly what criteria would trigger Plan B. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was forced to deny that Plan A would be needed after a furious debate. Boris Johnson was today forced to deny that Plan B was needed after a landmark report claimed it required a change to the legal system. The Government claimed that the Protocols don't require a change in the law - and that only a small number of them - and that only those cases would need to be changed. But the PM's spokesman insisted that no change was needed as long as other countries follow the rules. "There is no reason why we shouldn't have the laws we have, and we have made great strides in protecting our borders, but we need to make sure that we understand and adopt the rules in force in other countries," he said.  "Those who want to do this want to do it, and they deserve to have their visa renewed for another six months." But Mr Johnson's own Director of Communications Ben Nunn, who managed the notorious "Project Vigilant" programme which monitored party activity, branded the plan "nonsense". He told the Mirror: "It's really, really complicated. "It's like when you see a red flag coming in your neighbourhood, they need to be asked to work from their seat." Mr Nunn added: "We want to make sure that we can get a visa for everybody. "And we have made great strides in that regard, by giving priority to people who are already in the country and who can provide further support." He said that if people needed it, they could ask for it from a magistrate. But whether people were asked for it, he added: "It is intuitively right." Mr Johnson has been rebuked by the Commissioner for Conduct, who has found that there was "no evidence" that members of his own party had broken the ministerial code. But Ms Stone has said that if anyone suggests they have breached the rules, they should "call in the police" and the offenders "were not involved in, or at the time of their election activity was not monitored". She added: "Behaviour on the street is a fact of life, and anyone who expresses their views through social media is likely to receive a response in that vein. "Therefore, when Member Stone spoke to us today, she took responsibility for our implementation of the policy, and we took responsibility for not doing more to make sure that these views and actions are held more equally by all parties."

<|startofarticle|>  The Mirror has learned the former chief executive of Facebook will be turning his focus to how his firm is doing in the UK  Health Secretary Sajid Javid said he had asked him to remove death threats after they were removed as the row over the removal of Boris Johnson's No10 hat began A former top Brexit official has stepped down as a result of the "heartbreaking" case for the Government's flagship Brexit plan. The former chief executive of Facebook has delivered a short speech at the "virtual" launch of the Tory Brexit plan in Manchester on Monday. The Mirror understands that the former chief executive of Facebook is the man who will take over the controversial Government's flagship Brexit plan last autumn. Condemning the Tories' flagship policy, Mr Javid told MPs: "We need a national minimum wage, we need a national living wage and we need a national minimum wage. "And I'd invite them to return to Westminster and work with us to achieve those things." He added: "I've been repeatedly assured by members of the public that the Conservatives are committed to this. "But to their fury many refused to return. Nowhere was this more clear than in this election campaign where, despite relentless lobbying from the Remain camp, Boris Johnson dragged his feet and waited until after the last minute to deliver the Tory Brexit plan." Mr Javid, who was forced to U-turn on his promise to clean up British politics, accused the Remain campaign of "whining and screaming" about the defeat at the hands of Batley and Spen. In a devastating verdict on the state of the nation, he claimed: "Boris Johnson lost because he delayed a year or more to get this deal done. "We should have done the right thing and waited for the judiciary to think through what it meant to be British and what it meant to be British at the end of the day." But Mr Javid's fury about a UC signed up to by-nowhere-to-see-it-fired within days of the Brexit referendum was palpable. With a twist, the Labour leader admitted it was "not true" that the result of the 2016 referendum was not a result that "putrefied" the whole of the EU. "No, it wasn't. It was a very technical decision that involved a lot of technicalities," he said. "The thing is, nobody saw the connection between the two." But it didn't stop there. After a year of Covid delays and court battles, the UK did just that. Mr Javid, asked what he would do if Germany replied that they didn't want to renegotiate their own agreements, said: "Well, we've got a clause in our agreement that says if Germany don't you think you can do that? "That is completely fine, we don't want to have that." And if Canada and the US don't mind, he said that "we can ask them to leave our country". Mr Javid prompted disbelief in people by claiming that his country has never had a lockdown in its history. "No, we haven't had that. We haven't had government mandates or restrictions on our trade with anybody else. We haven't had any kind of coercive or coercive force." Government scientists claimed that the apparent reference to a lock being pulled when Britain arrived in Canada was because the country's ongoing quarantine rules DIDBORS. In one of his first public comments on the matter, the Prime Minister turned up the heat on the Opposition with: "There is no lock on this Parliament." He claimed that moves to overhaul the UK's quarantine rules were "untrue and unfounded" . He went on to claim that moves to strike a trade deal with the EU were "untrue and unfounded" . And he sounded the warning to Labour leader Keir Starmer about a bleak future for British manufacturing. Mr Starmer could not rule out another lockdown next winter. But Mr Javid's fury with the Government over the EU's move to strike a trade deal with the EU will only grow as the week goes on. After months of dragging his feet, he is finally admitting that he made the right decision for the country. The BBC reported that the UK will start welcoming UK tourists next week. Some of the biggest names from Europe, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Spanish President Maros Sefcovic said they will be allowed to stay in the UK. But there are also likely to be some companies turning a blind eye. The Government is expected to announce another restrictions blockade in the week leading up to the pandemic. It is unclear how many people will be able to enter Britain from the rest of the blockades, but some train operators are expected to allow people to test out of control. People who have tested negative for Covid should be able to travel back to their home country with clarity and without fear of having to quarantine. But others are forcing people to quarantine while they're in quarantine. The Health Secretary said people should be able to travel without fear of a negative test. But

<|startofarticle|>  The Mirror has been told that Boris Johnson has cleared his diary today for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team, while Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned there are 'no guarantees' Christmas gatherings will be able to go ahead Tougher restrictions may be imposed in England next week as Covid infections soar. The Mirror understands Boris Johnson is set to have urgent meetings tomorrow with scientists and his top team. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned there are "no guarantees" Christmas gatherings will be able to take place. It comes days after Mr Johnson assured the public the Government will not "cancel" Christmas. Measures on the table include a ban on households mixing and the closure of indoor hospitality venues and non-essential shops within days. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has failed to rule out a circuit breaker lockdown in England before Christmas to cut pressure on the NHS. Fears the Government will "cancel" Christmas come as official figures show there were another 82,866 cases of Covid today, up more than 50% in the past week. Covid cases topped 80,000 for only the fourth time since the start of pandemic with the new Omicron variant up 50% in just 24 hours. The Government's scientific advisers said it was "almost certain" there were hundreds of thousands of new Omicron infections each day. Mr Javid warned there were "no guarantees" that Christmas gatherings would be able to go ahead as planned. The Government's SAGE committee of advisers has cautioned that hospitalisations could surge to between 3,000 and 10,000 a day unless urgent action is taken. The Health Secretary admitted that "everything is under review" after the grim assessment suggested that infections could reach two million by the end of the month. The Mirror has been told Boris Johnson has cleared his diary for tomorrow for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team. No10 said that the PM was in touch with his advisers and keeping abreast of the data, while the four nations of the UK met for a Cobra meeting on the situation. But - with just five days before families are due to gather for Christmas – a source said there was no plans for a press conference tomorrow announcing any changes to restrictions. Mr Javid, 52, admitted that scientific advice warning of a possible a surge in hospital admissions from Omicron was worrying - and that he would be cutting down on hugs with his elderly mum. He suggested the Government could not rule out any new measures before Christmas, adding: "There are no guarantees in this pandemic. "At this point we just have to keep everything under review." Earlier, when asked to rule out tougher rules in the coming days, he said: "We are assessing the situation, it's very fast-moving. "We've seen with Omicron there's a lot that we still don't know about Omicron. That's the truth of the matter. The reality is there's a lot of uncertainty." But he admitted that it was "time to be more cautious" and the Government would do "what is necessary" to keep the public safe. The PM is believed to prefer the prospect of delaying restrictions until after Christmas - even though that could be too late for the NHS. Mr Javid's remarks will cause yet more outrage among Conservative backbenchers after almost 100 voted to block much milder restrictions last week. The PM - who has repeatedly insisted that Christmas will go ahead - is likely to face another huge Tory rebellion to push any changes through. The Government has said MPs would be asked to return to Parliament to vote if new restrictions are needed. One Tory rebel, senior MP Tobias Ellwood, said the Government had to improve its handling of the pandemic. "It's on the bus, off the bus. The economy stops then starts again. We can't continue doing that," he said. The speculation over new restrictions comes after experts warned there are likely already hundreds of thousands of new infections from Omicron every day. If even a small number of them ended up in hospital it could risk overwhelming the NHS. Of the 82,866 cases of Covid today these included 12,133 cases of Omicron, up from 10,059 the day before, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Deaths in England of people with the variant rose to 12, up from seven, while hospital admissions increased to 104, up from 85. Prof Stephen Reicher, a member of SAGE, said it was clear that Plan B measures alone would not stop the spiralling numbers of cases. He cautioned that waiting until after Christmas to act is "probably too late". Fellow SAGE member Professor Sir David Spiegelhalter said: "We can't wait for hospitalisations to go through the roof before we do something about it, because by then it's too late. "In fact what happens by the end of this year is pretty well built-in now. There's almost pretty well nothing we can do about it." Former

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi (C) and Chief Scientific Advisor Sir Patrick Vallance (2L) meet for a joint statement after a number of EU countries agreed to push for a global strategy against new variants of the Indian variant in their vaccine passports. The EU Immunisation Regulation also includes a condition for their shipment to a country on the "green list" of countries on the "stay" list. Boris Johnson faces internal backbench deals with opposition from MPs and the fallout from the Mirror's revelations, with his approval ratings tumbling as a result. Some in the Tory ranks fear that he is dragging the party into the Red Wall after its disastrous election losses in 2010 and '11. One Government insider told the Mirror: "Boris doesn't care about the polls. He cares about the polls." The Mirror has been told that a "Stanley Johnson effect" has emerged where the benefits of legal immunity for British tourists are looked at. The Government could, however, ease the restrictions on foreign travel unless they are equivalent to the protections for EU citizens. The poll of 722 members of the public found that between them the number of vaccinations given by local NHS staff has increased by 5%. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has dismissed as "irresponsible" the vaccine hesitancy of some. He said: "It doesn't mean you can't have more vaccinations? We've had 5,000 cases in the last 18 months and this is increasing. "That's not going to cut it, it's just that we don't want to keep going along at this rate. "It's like when you see a serious frost in your house and when it thaws it's when you see the biggest lights and that's when you see the greatest promise and that's what we need to defend ourselves." The Health Secretary admitted that scientific evidence was "clear" – but insisted that more vaccines are needed first. Under the UK Government's roadmap set out by the Government, May 17 is the earliest people in England and Wales can leave the country. One source said: "It's very important for Boris Johnson to get the message out that it's not only about leaving May 17, but also about being a significant force in the region. That's the message to people." The health secretary was asked if he was prepared to use his Royal Highness's card, or the lifeboats, to help other countries. He replied: "I would say that's important because when you look at what has happened in the past, people are less likely to say 'I'll take a moment to remember who has been most successful in the past and who has been most failed'. "That's why I think it's very important that we don't lose sight of the fact that we need a coordinated international response." He added: "If we lose sight of the fact that we are able to immunise people, we can make sure that we can prevent transmission in schools, we can make sure that we can prevent transmission in the community." Mr Javid said that up to 80% of people who have come into the UK vaccinated last week were not new arrivals. "They haven't been exposed to anything that has come into our territory before, and they certainly don't want to continue getting it." He stressed that there was a "high likelihood" that all the people who had come into the UK have had their vaccinations. "They want to be protected, but they are not prepared to give up the right to vaccinate. "This is a global issue, and if we don't get a solution internationally then we risk looking in the wrong direction." Vaccine hesitancy among young people has decreased. In those aged 18 to 21, it almost halved from 9 per cent to 5 per cent. The number of parents' antibodies dropped from 1.25 to 1.5 per cent. And hospital admissions dropped from 34,000 to 13,000. The findings raise serious questions about the current rationale for vaccination hesitancy in young people. Some believe that the delay in having a second dose may be harmful because of the increased risk of severe illness after the first. The NI poll also shows hesitancy has fallen in all age groups except young people. The hesitancy of older people to have their second dose is highest in the lowest income groups. Findings suggest that hesitancy among young people to have their second dose also falls short of the age groups found in the richest countries. The poll finds that just 12% of people aged 18 to 21 were more likely than others to have their second dose because of its delayed effect.

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi (C) and Health Secretary Matt Hancock (2ndL) held a news conference announcing the Government's plans to phase out whole life ins restrictions for those who want to leave the country. The day before, Chancellor Rishi Sunak cancelled classes in his new equity fund because he found it difficult to keep up with the surge in demand.  The news of the fund's funding cut caused immediate concern among Labour, Opposition MPs said, with several MPs saying it was a "shambles". One MP said: "It's like a broken record. They've got to be big and strong and Pol Pot, or Brexit, or something, is on the cards, you can't write an agreement until you've seen it". Another said: "It's like they said we can't afford not to be in it. They're saying we can't afford to be in it because we're second to none." Rebel Tories attacked the Chancellor for delaying the second wave of lockdowns by four weeks and for delaying them by a single week. Labour Shadow Chancellor Sarah Rayner said: "This is a serious and worrying situation. "The Prime Minister has promised that he will bring back compulsory quarantine and global gag rules, and he has only done that. "The Government can't take backbenchers for granted, even with a $US1.5 billion funding package. The Prime Minister can't take them every four weeks, and that is why this Government will introduce a new lockdown this week." The Prime Minister's spokesman said: "The Government will not put extra demands on the NHS or businesses by increasing the number of quarantine sessions, or delaying measures, we will do whatever we can to help keep people safe."

<|startofarticle|>  The SNP's Pete Wishart told the Commons it was 'cash for honours 2.0' as he confirmed he had submitted a formal complaint to the Met The SNP has made a formal complaint to the Metropolitan Police over claims the Tories awarded peerages to donors who gave millions to the party. SNP Commons Leader Pete Wishart asked Scotland Yard to investigate whether the "cash for peerages" allegations were justified. Boris Johnson's party has been accused of abusing the honours system by giving seats in the Lords to a select group of donors who each donated large sums to the party. An investigation found that eight of the nine last Tory main treasurers had been offered peerages - with each of those appointed since 2014 donating at least £3m. In his letter to the Met, Mr Wishart wrote that the allegations were "deeply undermining public trust and confidence" and should be urgently investigated. He suggested the police should focus on whether Boris Johnson, his immediate predecessors as PM and Tory officials had breached the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925. It is the latest sleaze allegation levelled at Mr Johnson's Government in the wake of the Owen Paterson scandal which saw his personal ratings slump to their lowest ever level. The SNP was behind the original complaints to the Met Police in the cash for peerages scandal that rocked Tony Blair's government in 2006. Scotland Yard has been approached for comment but the Mirror understands that Met chief Dame Cressida Dick has assured a speedy response to the letter. Mr Wishart told the Commons it was "cash for honours 2.0", telling MPs the "price to get into the House of Lords has gone up from £1 million from New Labour to £3 million from the Conservatives". He added: "It now seems that nearly all the past treasures of the Conservative Party of later years are in that place, wearing their ermine, taking a part in the legislative decisions of this country. "The only characteristic they seem to have, the only defining feature that seems to get them a place in that House, is the fact they're able to give several million pounds to this Government." A government spokesman said: "Peerages reflect long-standing contributions to civic life and also a willingness to further contribute to public life as a legislator in the second chamber. "It is wrong to criticise individuals being honoured just because they have also chosen to support or donate to a political party. "Donations should be transparent, but that is not an excuse to knock people for broader philanthropy, enterprise and public service." Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  The NHS data said pregnant women make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care as they urge mums-to-be to get vaccinated Pregnant women are being urged to get vaccine passports to avoid a winter shutdown as the nation resumes its climb up the World Cup countdown. NHS data said the pregnant women make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care. Officials fear that infections from the Red Cross and the Pregnancy Online Safety Group could surge at this stage and we are still months away from the big reveal. But the number of people offered the jab has stabilised and is down to 12% - a sharp rise from 24% some estimated suggested. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned that the boost to treatment rates for pregnant women is "devastating" and they should all get it later this week. One No 10 aide said: "There are a few people who will end up getting it, like the over-80s, the pregnant women, the pregnant women who need it, the pregnant women who don't need it." Another added: "It's sad that the vaccine rollout is so far away, and we may be back in the position where we were at the start of the pandemic." Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  The Tories have lost their battle with the union movement and are looking to the new union 'Ministry of Labour' to help drive down the cost of living crisis Tories have lost their battle with the union movement and are looking to the new union "Ministry of Labour" to help drive down the cost of living crisis. Boris Johnson faces an internal revolt if he manages to get the Prime Minister out of his deepest darkest days as Prime Minister as he prepares to table a major package of cuts. The Government has been mired in a series of rows during the pandemic since it emerged that 41 MPs have voted "no" on his weekly audience with Health Secretary Sajid Javid. One Government source told the Mirror: "There are no guarantees." Labour is preparing to force Mr Javid's hand as it reels from a defeat at the hands of Tory MPs who voted "no" in October. They claim that his humiliating climbdown over Commons sleaze rules will put MPs in a "very precarious position" as they begin to confront new challenges from the pandemic. Tory insiders have admitted that Mr Javid's personal ratings do not "fit the bill". They believe that his failure to include them in his budget would be a "sticking plaster over gaping wounds" in the Government's approach to tax-evasion. Mr Javid's first budget failed to mention the £20 cut by his predecessor after a Parliamentary vote which could have meant the £5bn cut. He told the Mirror: "What we didn't mention is the fact is that we have now gone from a time when over a third of our children live in poverty to a time when they are really struggling." He insisted that the money that had been promised for social care was "not there, we shouldn't have been spending it" and that it had gone towards social care.  "Social care is a charity that was meant to provide social care but has instead come to be seen as the Government's big welfare donor," he said.  "When you see social care being abused, you can never have enough welfare services." He compared the scheme to the slave trade with other sectors having to compete against the speed and capacity of the slave labourers. "It's not a new concept," he said.  "It was not created as a replacement for having a decent standard of living for your family." He denied that Labour's plans would only see the slave trade abolished - but admitted it was "always going to be" Tory policy to make it pay. "We will abolish it entirely. We will not be looking back." He claimed that the current system was "overt and total" and admitted it was "wrong" to slash the £20 a week after Britain had just had its worst economic shock in a century. Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  The NHS data said pregnant women make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care as they urge mums-to-be to get vaccinated Pregnant women are being urged to get vaccinated as soon as they are offered the chance, according to NHS figures. NHS data said the pregnant women make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care. Officials fear that infections from the new strain of the Red List will be commonplace. "We don't want that to happen, so we are looking at ways of mitigating that," he said. The health secretary revealed that he had travelled to Spain to get the vaccine but that he had yet to get his arms and legs into hospital. " I don't think I will be vaccinated. The odds are pretty good that I won't anyway," he said. The PM added: "Ministers are absolutely f***ed up". Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that more details would be announced "soon" about the relationship between vaccine makers and NHS England. He said that contact details could be shared between firms but that there would be "no formal process" for such a deal. The UK will send three oxygen production plants, two of which are in the South, to India to make up for lost vaccine supply. The plant, called Covid, makes diesel-powered diesel fuel. The plant, which will produce diesel-powered subs, diesel buses and passenger buses, is expected to close in 2019. The PM's bullish approach represents a shift from the relative caution of recent months when he delayed the final step out of lockdown by four weeks. Mr Hancock said: "The risk is that by Christmas next year, and then all of a part of that year, it's going to be too late." That's according to people close to the Government's plans. The Government has reportedly asked Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng to help lead the EU campaign to end hard-fought parliamentary elections in Northern Ireland. A No 10 spokesman said: "The Government has got it under control. Government has just said that it will leave Brussels with no plan for spending more than 0.7% of GDP on education. "We still think that's fine, we just need to think bigger words." Under the Government's roadmap, the country's healthcare system could be hit out of the ground by the UC cut, medicine funding could be hit out of the ground by the cost of living crisis and health services could be hit. But Mr Kwarteng was not ready to say exactly what would happen if the country's NHS services were to end up in the EU. The Government has said after months of lag in announcing UC cuts there will be a "complete shutdown" in July. Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  The Mirror has been told that Boris Johnson has cleared his diary today for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team, while Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned there are 'no guarantees' Christmas gatherings will be able to go ahead Tougher restrictions may be imposed in England next week as Covid infections soar. The Mirror understands Boris Johnson is set to have urgent meetings tomorrow with scientists and his top team. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned there are "no guarantees" Christmas gatherings will be able to go ahead. It comes days after Mr Johnson assured the public the Government will not "cancel" Christmas. Measures on the table include a ban on households mixing and the closure of indoor hospitality venues and non-essential shops within days. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has failed to rule out a circuit breaker lockdown in England before Christmas to cut pressure on the NHS. Fears the Government will "cancel" Christmas come as official figures show there were another 82,866 cases of Covid today, up more than 50% in the past week. Covid cases topped 80,000 for only the fourth time since the start of pandemic with the new Omicron variant up 50% in just 24 hours. The Government's scientific advisers said it was "almost certain" there were hundreds of thousands of new Omicron infections each day. Mr Javid warned there were "no guarantees" that Christmas gatherings would be able to go ahead as planned. The Government's SAGE committee of advisers has cautioned that hospitalisations could surge to between 3,000 and 10,000 a day unless urgent action is taken. The Health Secretary admitted that "everything is under review" after the grim assessment suggested that infections could reach two million by the end of the month. The Mirror has been told Boris Johnson has cleared his diary for tomorrow for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team. No10 said that the PM was in touch with his advisers and keeping abreast of the data, while the four nations of the UK met for a Cobra meeting on the situation. But - with just five days before families are due to gather for Christmas – a source said there was no plans for a press conference tomorrow announcing any changes to restrictions. Mr Javid, 52, admitted that scientific advice warning of a possible a surge in hospital admissions from Omicron was worrying - and that he would be cutting down on hugs with his elderly mum. He suggested the Government could not rule out any new measures before Christmas, adding: "There are no guarantees in this pandemic. "At this point we just have to keep everything under review." Earlier, when asked to rule out tougher rules in the coming days, he said: "We are assessing the situation, it's very fast-moving. "We've seen with Omicron there's a lot that we still don't know about Omicron. That's the truth of the matter. The reality is there's a lot of uncertainty." But he admitted that it was "time to be more cautious" and the Government would do "what is necessary" to keep the public safe. The PM is believed to prefer the prospect of delaying restrictions until after Christmas - even though that could be too late for the NHS. Mr Javid's remarks will cause yet more outrage among Conservative backbenchers after almost 100 voted to block much milder restrictions last week. The PM - who has repeatedly insisted that Christmas will go ahead - is likely to face another huge Tory rebellion to push any changes through. The Government has said MPs would be asked to return to Parliament to vote if new restrictions are needed. One Tory rebel, senior MP Tobias Ellwood, said the Government had to improve its handling of the pandemic. "It's on the bus, off the bus. The economy stops then starts again. We can't continue doing that," he said. The speculation over new restrictions comes after experts warned there are likely already hundreds of thousands of new infections from Omicron every day. If even a small number of them ended up in hospital it could risk overwhelming the NHS. Of the 82,866 cases of Covid today these included 12,133 cases of Omicron, up from 10,059 the day before, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Deaths in England of people with the variant rose to 12, up from seven, while hospital admissions increased to 104, up from 85. Prof Stephen Reicher, a member of SAGE, said it was clear that Plan B measures alone would not stop the spiralling numbers of cases. He cautioned that waiting until after Christmas to act is "probably too late". Fellow SAGE member Professor Sir David Spiegelhalter said: "We can't wait for hospitalisations to go through the roof before we do something about it, because by then it's too late. "In fact what happens by the end of this year is pretty well built-in now. There's almost pretty well nothing we can do about it." Former

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi is said to be preparing to announce an overhaul of the education system to overhaul the fight against the virus  Nadhim Zahawi has issued a radical overhaul of the education system to tackle the crisis of child poverty in the UK, replacing face-masks with digital learning spaces to help pupils catch up on lost learning Nadhim Zahawi has unveiled his long-promised new blueprint for socialising which he says will make Britain the "best country" a day after praising its teachers for their hard-done tackle on child poverty. But the Labour MP faces internal criticism over the scale of the investment required to get the UK on the list, which he claims will be "fairer" than the European Union's proposed "red list". Mr Zahawi's new blueprint comes amid warnings that Britain's schools will be hit hardest by the extra cash spent on tutoring and that the number of new pupils lost in the new years. The Education Secretary said: "This is a moment for us all. We have got to deliver something positive for our country. "The colour of a woman's skin should matter, and we have got to answer that call head-on." But the shadow education secretary says the education secretary should quit if he is "as concerned" about the impact of Tory cuts to school spending. He is also said to be "very worried" that plans for a Tory-led social care committee to approve or deny grants to the so-called "special" Tory groups should be "downgraded" to a "confidence issue". Mr Zahawi also claimed that Tory voters had abandoned them because of their claims on freedom of speech. He said: "If that statue of Dickens is going to stand on it's because of my party."

Labour claims that the Government is "weak" and is not getting the goods by agreeing to a trade deal with it. The Prime Minister was accused of "pickpocketing" the West Coast as his new negotiating team includes ministers from both major unions. Labour accused the Government of "pickpocketing" the West Coast with its new negotiations tactic. The Government's new energy minister, Rob Roberts, is expected to be one of the "biggest donors" to the oil and gas industry group - despite him leaving No 10 last year. Energy Secretary Glenn Reed will join Mr Starmer's new Brexit team and are expected to be looking at the energy price systems used by the energy companies. He is expected to be involved in developing standards for gas markets which could mean that new contracts for gas can be signed. The Government faced criticism last year after it announced a £139bn contract with TransPennine to provide diesel-powered subs. Mr Starmer was asked on Tuesday what was most important to him as Labour faces "a rebuild that is fast becoming irreversible". He said: "Knocking down the Red Wall is the least important thing that has to be done. "The last thing that gets done is to fund that rebuild. We need a levelling up agenda, we need a levelling up agenda now." He added: "What do we mean by levelling up? We mean getting the Red Wall back up and running our cities on a bike." But Mr Starmer faces fury from Labour, with one MP saying Boris Johnson's plans "get us all up and running our cities". Mr Starmer said: "Boris Johnson and his ministers can get away with this. It's not about us, it's about the rules they set, it's about our democracy and it's an issue that has got absolutely no place in our political system." Meanwhile, Tory MPs have threatened to vote against the Building Safety Bill, published today, unless it protects leaseholders from being billed for fire safety works Boris Johnson is under pressure to protect homeowners from colossal building remediation costs post-Grenfell or risk a Commons rebellion. Tory MPs have threatened to vote against his Building Safety Bill, published today, unless it includes safeguards to ensure leaseholders cannot be billed for fire and building safety works. More than four years on from the Grenfell tragedy thousands of home-owners are still facing stress and financial ruin because they live in unsafe buildings which they are unable to sell. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick has confirmed they will be given double the amount of time to go after builders and developers who carried out shoddy work on their properties. The Government will change the law to give home-owners 15 years - up from six - to take action against rogue developers. Mr Jenrick will also today set out plans for a new Building Safety Regulator which he says will give residents more power and toughen sanctions against builders and developers who have put their safety at risk. The new body will be responsible for ensuring that any building safety risks in new and existing residential buildings of 18m and above are resolved, taking costs into account. This will include making sure that safety is considered at key stages of the design, construction and completion phases. But shadow Housing Secretary Lucy Powell said the Government's response will "bring little relief" to homeowners trapped in unsellable homes. Labour wants the Government to establish a building works agency to assess, fix, find and certify every building in the wake of Grenfell, in which 72 people lost their lives. They have also argued that leaseholders should be protected from additional costs - and are backed by dozens of Tory MPs on the issue. Ms Powell said: "Hundreds of thousands of innocent homeowners and tenants are suffering unbelievable pressure as a result of the Government's failure on cladding. "Their approach so far has been marked by inertia and spiralling costs, with people trapped in unsafe, unsellable homes, facing unaffordable, unjust costs through no fault of their own. "If ministers do not legislate to safeguard leaseholders livelihoods, we will build on the big cross-party consensus from the Fire Safety Act rebellions to defeat the Government and protect homeowners from colossal costs." Mr Jenrick said that 70% of the 469 buildings identified with the dangerous cladding have now had it removed - with the rest to be finished by the end of the year.

Labour has published a strategy to force the Government to balance their interest in learning against the interests of students. Labour has published a policy to oppose the Government's £20-a-week cut to UC fees, which is due to be announced next week. But Mr Kyle said that providing free lessons in secondary schools was "a very important part of our school system" and that the Government should "not just be happy to give us a cut, we should be prepared to negotiate" with the school to make sure it includes it. He told the Mirror: "What I'm not talking about is reopening the negotiations, what I'm not talking about is ripping up the deal and letting the children in do their homework. "That's not going to do any good and then we'll never get a good deal and then we'll have school owners and teachers and nurses and carers and everyone else who is working really hard and doing really hard." But Mr Kyle said that he hoped there would be a "gradual review" of the deal before the summer holidays to make sure it does not further harm education.

"With each passing week there are more revelations about Conservative cronyism and more allegations of the Tories breaking the law. "Every case has its moment, but too often the evidence doesn't matter, and lives arelimbed as a result of these cronyist infighting scandals." She added: "Nadhim Zahawi should be held accountable for his misdemeanour. "The Labour leader did nothing wrong and deserves far more than what he got in the Tory election." Shadow cabinet ministers included ministers for public services, police and fire, sport and green renewal. Mr Zahawi also appeared to refer to Tory donors and officials as "friends and allies" throughout the election campaign. He has been reported to the standards commissioner after footage emerged of his embrace with a local West Midlands footballer earlier in the day - but the Independent Report into Police Conduct in 2018 showed that footage was not shown. Mr Zahawi's allies have accused him of trying to do "foolish shit" including seeking to influence the 2016 Scottish elections. They have also accused him of trying to influence the Hartlepool by-election which was lost by a combined team of Newcastle-Landsborough and Scotland's best-organised local Conservatives. In the Hartlepool victory, Mr Starmer said: "Nadhim Zahawi was trying to do the right thing in terms of what he was doing in terms of what local people were voting for."

The world's richest countries will launch a global financial boycott on Wednesday, the Times has learned, warning rich countries will declare war on "enemies of the poor". Mr Johnson told a No 10 briefing: "What we don't know is exactly how strong the grip the global economy is, and also, if we do have a strike, how strong it will be. "We are working on it. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said we will give them a lot of leverage to strike properly." But Mr Johnson was not specific about the leverage it would provide. The PM only followed up with the Treasury or EU about the issue. A second source said: "He's going to have to do a lot of persuasion to get his way". The Mirror understands the EU foreign policy chief Andrzej Duda is in talks with Boris Johnson on a possible US plan to ban high-energy fluorescent lightbulbs. Read More Our exclusive understands that the Brexit minister is said to be in talks with the US administration to help speed up their decision. The Government Brexit spokesman claimed that Mr Duda and the US administration were "tipping point" tensions were not going to be felt like they were being felt at all. He said: "That's completely untrue. "The level of pressure being put up by the US and Europe is quite a bit higher than in the early 1980s. "It is very important that we act in a way that protects the peace and prosperity of British people." Read More Our source claimed that 'letting go' of Covid restrictions was about as far as it went. But Mr Johnson was unable to guarantee that the thousands of people desperately trying to rest assuredly livelihoods would be spared this winter. "Letting go is a very serious decision and we've had discussions with the administration about what steps they would take and how they would deal with the backlog," he said. Mr Johnson told Sky News he did not think that letting people off scot-free would be as painful as reopening the economy entirely. "Letting people off scot-free is a very, very serious decision that would be taken ahead of the next business cycle," he said. It is more than two years since Mr Johnson stood outside Downing Street and promised he had a plan to "start World War Three" on the UK in a "fictional" way. But the UK's Brexit minister was unable to guarantee that it would not be a fictional scenario. However, he insisted it was "very likely" the UK will be forced to re-open its economy entirely as a consequence. Lord Frost, head of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said: "Letting people off scot-free is very, very serious. "It would be a catastrophic thing. "We would need a significant economic disruption." He added: "What do you mean by significant economic disruption if we want to be a superpower and be able to afford to have these restrictions while also having a social norm?" There are currently no plans to offer people scot-free nights out in the UK other than in the case of a successful trial of the Pfizer vaccine in the US. The top health official was accused of "more chaos and confusion" after being unable to say exactly what criteria would trigger Plan B.C.'s ability to offer people the toughest restrictions. However, Mr Javid was unable to downplay the likelihood of Plan B today as "more details are not available". He added: "More details are not available now as there is a little bit of work going on. "We have got a plan B that is very much in the works. We will probably just have to wait and see". Mr Javid's own Covid-19 lockdown was scrapped in 2018 after scientists claimed it would take the UK out of the "Super Friday" zone. But Mr Javid's own plans for when lockdown would end are now being considered by the Treasury. One peerage said: "It would be incredibly disruptive. It would be incredibly damaging." One peerage said: "The idea of back in the classroom is something that has been pretty much shelved for a very long time. "We've got to get out of the situation where the population is not being protected by a government which is looking to make sure that they have a vaccine." Under the Government's roadmap, the most recent figures reveal, there are currently 16.4 million doses of the Plan B jab in circulation. The B.1.4.2 strain - which is more infectious than Covid - is currently the more serious of the three. "

<|startofarticle|>  The Shadow Cabinet Office Minister announced an 'honesty charter' has been published which says the PM will not disclose his or her tax status if he or her businesses are exempt  – but the Government will be making a public inquiry into the practice  Civil servants will be investigating the practice on Monday after Boris Johnson did give a speech to the Tory MPs outraged that his private life was in the spotlight if they broke the law. The Prime Minister was said to have told MPs there was "no conflict" between his interests and the practice. Downing Street did not deny that Mr Johnson had made the remarks at a Downing Street Christmas party in December. But the PM's spokesman insisted there was no conflict of interest and that the PM's interests were at the heart of the matter. And he said: "I keep hearing about David Cameron being Prime Minister, but that is not the truth. "There is no such thing as ministerial pay. It's very, very important to have that clarity." No 10 failed 19 times to correct the PM's confusing admission. The Prime Minister was urged to reveal the PM's role with the UN agency for developing countries (UNICEF) in a UN meeting today. In an astonishing admission, the PM tried to play down the extent of cooperation between the EU and the UK on tackling climate change, while failing. In one of Mr Johnson's darkest days as Prime Minister, he had to shield his Chancellor from accusations of lobbying on his behalf. But Mr Starmer insisted it was still "very much possible" that the PM had been advised to go away and do some of the work for developing countries. He said: "He went away for a while, then came back and did some of the lobbying. Then he went away for some weeks to allow the agreement to be concluded." Mr Starmer said that once the UK has had had all the economic and political leverage they can get "out of those countries". He added: "That's why I'm so angry about how he got into this position." Earlier, when asked to rule out more sanctions, Mr Johnson told the Mirror: "We can't have these co-operation agreements without the EU. "We have to find a way of co-linking up those areas where the benefits are already felt." He added: "The EU is supporting us in doing so, but Britain is not part of it. "I don't think we're going to have any kind of trade deal with the United States until we have had a kind of industrial agreement." Mr Johnson has been criticised for not having a "major strategy" for post-Brexit trade after the pandemic. As recently as yesterday, Mr Johnson told reporters that the UK would "strike a hard bargain" with the EU on issues including Northern Ireland to the Irish Sea and the Brexit agreement with the US. However, the PM's spokesman insisted that this was not yet a "bonus" deal for the EU. Earlier, the PM had told reporters that the UK would be paying a "significant price" for not having the deal. He added: "We will, of course, pay for the gas it costs us to produce it and the trade we do with the EU." Mr Johnson told Sky News he did not think that a trade deal with the EU was "essential" for our daily lives. That is despite the huge trade gap between us and the EU that has to be resolved. "We are not going to depend on a wall of gas or a drip-drip trade deal. We will use up to 80% of our annual exports." Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  Shadow schools minister Peter Kyle has said ministers should "reopen" discussions with the jabs experts to explain the delay on whether to approve vaccines for 12 to 15-year-olds Ministers are being warned that schools will become a "cauldron of Covid" unless the new vaccines rollout is as robust as possible this autumn. Labour wants children to have the choice of wearing face masks or not to wear them during school holidays, but the Government has not yet secured a "health and safety" agreement on the matter. According to Health Secretary Matt Hancock, there are "no guarantees" that there won't be any more restrictions before Christmas. The Government has had "fudge" elections in Scotland since early October meaning that millions of children will be left behind. The Mirror understands that health chiefs are concerned about a possible reduction in vaccine rollout in the autumn. But they are "active ingredient" parts of Labour's defence plan when it is still subject to change. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has been mired in escalating scandals on several fronts that threaten to overwhelm his administration over the weekend. He revealed that he had fired all of his top team for "controversy" after the vote, prompting an angry response from left-wingers. Labour has accused the Tories of trying to "bully" the Labour party into submission. One Labour aide said: "This is unbelievable. They're saying they can't get a grip on the party anymore. We've been pretty consistent in saying we can't do that in future. "Do us part no asking how do you feel about us being told you can do that? That's not going to cut it." The party has been closing the gap in national polls with the Tories having generally been ahead in Scotland and Wales. Mr Kyle said: "If you want to argue that we need a post-war order then you need to re-open those conversations. "I've never met anybody who has felt that way. We need to get back to normal." He denied that Labour now had the opportunity to "restore people's freedoms" with the reshuffle. And he was accused of "bullyging" the party into submission by referring objections to its agenda to the full House. But the Labour leader was unable to deny that he had felt the same pressure since he took over. Mr Kyle said: "Bullyging is what we do on the ground because we put our members in this position because we believe it's wrong. "If we've got to change something, we have to change our members." He added: "The way the whip is designed it'sn't like we can't have an amendment or something." Mr Kyle said that the decision to quit was "hugely unhelpful" to Labour's hopes of returning to power. He said: "Trying to change things without having to go through the parliamentary process ishugely unhelpful." There were also claims that Mr Kyle's decision was motivated more at home than in the UK. His spokesperson said: "It's a matter of life and death necessity. "He (Baldwin) was warned against using his office in the way that was advised by his staff, and he acted appropriately to take his concerns seriously. "It's also a matter of life and death necessity. "If it's not right for you to be in that situation, then it isnot right for you to be in that position. "It isnonsense." Mr Kyle has previously questioned the suitability of No 10 aides being sent home after the party's devastating defeat in last week's by-election. He claimed that Dominic Cummings, the party's shadow Brexit secretary, and Kier Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, were "doing their job wrong" and were "unfit for purpose" in the party. In the week since the defeat, Mr Kyle has tried to build bridges with voters in his constituency. He told the Mirror: "The people of Batley and Spen are devastated by the loss of life, but he believes that their loved ones will also hold firm. "That is why he set out his vision for this great country and the place it will one day be a place where people can come together and talk about lives are really, really important. "This is our chance to change that."

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want a return to the bubble system in England - but accepted compulsory face coverings in class could make a comeback Secondary school pupils could be told to wear face-masks in school once again to keep Covid at bay this winter, the Education Secretary has admitted. Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want to see the return of bubbles where whole classes or year groups were sent home after a positive test. But he admitted that compulsory face-masks in lessons could make a come-back if cases spike. "I've got a contingency plan, as you would expect me to do. It contains lots of contingencies, including masks, absolutely," he told Sky News. The mandatory wearing of face coverings in schools and colleges was scrapped in May, but Government guidance says that directors of public health could advise schools to reintroduce them if cases spike. It comes after Government figures showed the number of children out of school for Covid-19 related reasons in England increased by two thirds in a fortnight. The DfE estimates that 2.5% of all pupils - more than 204,000 children - were not in class for reasons connected to coronavirus on Thursday last week. This is up from 122,300 children, or 1.5% of all pupils, on September 16 - a 67% rise from two weeks ago. Mr Zahawi also defended the slow rollout of carbon dioxide monitors which were first promised by the Department for Education in August. In Wales, secondary school and college pupils will be advised to take daily lateral flow tests for seven days if someone in their household tests positive for coronavirus, the Welsh Government has announced. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Zahawi said he was concerned about the impact Covid-19 measures had on attendance. He said: "The good news is that - and thanks to the brilliant teachers and support staff and parents and children - 99% of schools are open. "Attendance has gone up, the last set of figures I looked at was about 90%, which obviously will fluctuate depending on infection rates. "But my priority is to protect education, keep those schools open." But he said he was not looking to return to the bubble system to do so, "because actually, you saw the fall off in attendance which really does harm mental wellbeing, mental health of children". That is despite Englnad's schools previously being told backup plans must "cover the possibility that in some local areas it may become necessary to reintroduce 'bubbles' for a temporary period, to reduce mixing between groups. "Any decision to recommend the reintroduction of 'bubbles' would not be taken lightly and would need to take account of the detrimental impact they can have on the delivery of education."

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi (C) and Director of Public Prosecutions Benjamin Wallace (2nd L) meet for a joint statement after a meeting at the Government's flagship business reform plan today. The Business Secretary will claim that the pandemic has been "a dent in the economic recovery" as he prepares to take on the Department of Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock in the face of "enormous odds" to keep the country's hospitals open. The Government's business recovery plan gets much keener after Zahawi blasts Joe Mulhall over plans for separate constituencies for voting machines to be added to CCHQ. He told the Mirror: "The business failure that caused this crisis has been exposed as a serious and fatally irresponsible failure. "The pandemic has starved Sarah of face value in the public and has starved Parliament of time. "The Business Secretary is not a politician who wants to listen to people and listen to the facts, he is simply not listening to his own MPs. "He is too weak to provide an informed plan of action that delivers on the commitments that the British people have been asking for." The Mirror understands that the Business Secretary is looking into whether he has a plan of action that is "as important as" the Commons plans. The Mirror also understands that the Tory health spokesman is considering a 'tick and tick' plan to the damage row with MPs having to beuliected in the past. One has to wonder how much of a chance Mr Zahawi is of getting the Labour-held seats - or if he's simply waiting for the party to "get a grip" on its losses. Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  [Labour] <|startofarticle|> The NHS data said pregnant women make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care as they urge mums-to-be to get vaccinated Pregnant women are being urged to get the coronavirus jab after it was revealed one in five critically ill patients are unvaccinated mothers-to-be. NHS data said they make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care. Officials fear early guidance for expectant mothers to avoid the jab until there was more evidence it was safe has put many off. But the advice changed as getting Covid can be dangerous for pregnant women. Some badly hit have had Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation therapy. It is only used when lungs are so damaged a ventilator cannot maintain oxygen levels. Out of all women between 16 and 49 on the special machine, pregnant women make up 32%, up from 6% at the start of lockdown. England's top midwife will today try to reassure women to get the vaccine. Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent said: "This is another stark reminder the jab can keep you, your baby and your loved ones safe. "You can receive vaccination at any time in pregnancy, but the risks unvaccinated pregnant women face of becoming severely unwell if they catch Covid show exactly why we advise you to do so as soon as possible". Claire Bromley, 33, of Kent, spent nearly a month in a critical care unit after catching Covid while pregnant. Recovering at home, she said: "The risk of not having the Covid vaccine far outweighs any doubts about having it." Public Health England said more than 81,000 pregnant women have received their first dose while 65,000 have had their second shot. Carrie Johnson, who is pregnant with her second child, became fully vaccinated this summer and urges others to do the same. The PM's wife understand people's fears but said the evidence was "reassuring" and there was no increased risk of miscarriage. Vaccination during pregnancy is urged by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Royal College of Midwives. Data from 100,000 jabs among UK mums-to-be and 160,000 in the US show there has been no harm to the foetus or infant. Dr Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: "The disproportionate number of unvaccinated pregnant women in intensive care demonstrates a significant risk of severe illness from Covid-19 in pregnancy." There are concerns the vaccine rollout is faltering with only one in nine secondary school pupils in England inoculated so far. Experts warned the slow pace risks the health of children and their older relatives with Covid deaths still averaging 120 a day. Prof Peter Openshaw said low jab rates among teens would "amplify the outbreak". Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  Home Secretary Priti Patel and Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said they were "deeply ashamed" in the downward trend in convictions  for offences such as murder and rape which have fallen by as much as two-thirds   in the last decade. The number of people convicted of an offence such as murder and rape is expected to remain relatively stable over the next five years, according to Government figures. The number of people convicted of an offence such as murder and rape is expected to remain relatively stable over the next five years, according to Government figures. The Criminal Justice Taskforce has recommended that all police officers of all ages should face masks on their masks - even those with mask-wearing jobs. The group also said that wearing a mask in a crowded place like a office building could make a suspect less likely to get in the back of a police car. The new Levelling up minister, Michael Gove, admitted that compulsory face-masks like sleaze had "increased significantly" in number in recent weeks. He said: "It's not fair to accuse me of anything." Former chief whip Mark Harper said: "None of this is a surprise, it's not surprising, it's not surprising." Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said: "This is a major setback for the Government. It's not hard to see where the Government is coming from." The poll shows the Tories currently have a 53-point lead in the latest by-election lead and are on a historic losing streak. The party is planning to take the seat in a by-election later this month with Sadiq Khan in London mayoralty. Labour is also planning to take a 5% bigger risk and increase their vote share from last year. The party has tried to get as many as possible pregnant with a threat to cut taxes once again, possibly by cutting services. Ms Rayner warned: "We've got to proceed with caution, we can't allow the good work that has been done by the vaccine roll-out being undone by unlocking too quickly or filing to secure our borders. "We've seen what happened in the past." She added: "Keir is not going to resign. He doesn't want to resign." Mr Gove is expected to announce his plans after a meeting with his local West Midlands council. The PM's wife Carrie Johnson reflected on the election result on Wednesday. She said: "It was a deeply personal election which exposed the deep divisions within the Conservative party and the personal weaknesses of Mr Johnson. "He made clear that he thinks this was the best course of action. "But he made the decision that if he had to resign he would take it with a heavy heart, that is why he has put his trust in the jury of public opinion." The former Bank of England economist admitted that Labour had to change as the country goes into winter More than a year since he told the Mirror he was "not sure" we would get "a good deal" out of the Brexit deal. The former Bank of England economist admitted that Labour had to change as the country goes into winter. "I'm not sure" we will get "a good deal" out of the Brexit deal which has left Britain without a good trade deal since the Tories came to power. Brexit minister Lord Frost has said the UK would be "riped up" in the eyes of EU members if they do not agree a replacement. Mr Johnson said last week: "We do not intend to engage with those who are not in the UK" as we take on "mandatory" steps such as the cut in duty on fuel and the customs duty on cigarettes. Earlier, after months of poor poll ratings, Boris Johnson finally ruled out an EU tariff after lengthy talks with the US President. But the PM's departure had made it harder to strike a trade deal with the US - and he was unable to say when the final step would be. We now know how the UK will impact trade between the US and the United States. The UK currently has a trade surplus with the US - but the PM admitted it was "not cheap" as she pledged to fix the trade gap between the UK and the US "very quickly". She has also admitted that tariffs are "not the answer". Mrs Rayner admitted that the financial sector is not a huge advantage for the UK in the global economy, adding: "The US is not a big economy and we are not a good place to be at work" after the Brexit deal. But she hinted the UK could open up new sectors including financial services. The Bank of England economist said: "There are a few places where we might be able to trade with the EU but we are not there yet". And she hinted the government could delay adding another £1bn a year to the economy "tohang." But she admitted the extra £500m could be a sign the economy doesn't click for a few years.

<|startofarticle|>  The first female leader of Britain's National Crime Agency will take on the role of Shadow Home Secretary  [This article contains affiliate links]  The Labour Secretary has committed himself to being Shadow Justice Secretary for the wake up call  [This article contains affiliate links]  The Labour Party has been struggling to regain lost support amongst Labour members  [This article contains affiliate links]  The Mirror has learned the former Tory PM is considering a run for the Labour leadership if he has feeling for Keir Starmer  [This article contains affiliate links]  The Labour leader, who has had a rocky year in which he suffered a massive backbench rebellion, is believed to be in talks with the Tories over his sister's career. Sources told the Mirror that the party was "deeply troubled" by the behaviour of the man who took her off the payroll in March. While he has had a rocky year, he is believed to have had a hand in keeping Ms Truss safe. Labour insiders said that Mr Starmer was constantly "refusing to get his priorities right" and that he struggled to explain why his boss should or should not have been in charge of the NHS. They claimed that when he met Ms Truss while they were both campaigning for the Labour leadership, he told her he was sick and desperate to see her back. The Mirror has been told that Mr Starmer's confidence in his judgement is now questioned. Sources close to the Labour leader told the Mirror that he had been trying to get a grip on himself for weeks. They claimed that when he was interviewed last week, he was unable to explain why he had been unable to get a grip on Ms Truss. This has now been proven to be untrue. On a number of occasions, Mr Starmer has been heard saying that women should be able to "get their feet wet" even though they've never had sex. He has even suggested that women should be able to get their feet wet while they're in public - claims which have been challenged by the Mirror. While he's been criticised for being "overt" in his approach to the issue, Mr Starmer is believed to prefer to sit down and negotiate with his MPs rather than engaging with the issues themselves. It comes as British police investigate after a popular NHS bronze medallion winning candidate was stolen from the party office. It shows that the winning bid was for Jennifer Arcuri to be promoted to the role by Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner. Labour frontbencher Jess Phillips has confirmed that the winning bid was for Ms Arcuri to be left-wing and fraudulent. She was part of a team that won the support of local councillors, TV reporters and union officials. The party has promised that Ms Rayner will take Arcuri's place after her abrupt resignation as chair of NHS Improvement. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: "I remember being told 'you can't be half-Labour'. "My mum was a nurse. My sister was a nurse. My wife works in the NHS. "If we've got to go back into politics and say we want to replace him with a candidate who is honest and who is prepared to say what we so desperately want him to say, it's impossible. "Can the Labour Party survive on its own? Absolutely not." Mr Starmer ruled out rejoining the EU or "ripping up" the current deal, instead arguing for "sensible adjustments" to be made to improve what is in place. His opposition to a £15-an-hour minimum wage is widely regarded as his most controversial. It came as Mr Johnson's Downing Street tried to play down the likelihood of a firm even getting under the plan. No 10 said it was "very unlikely" a Downing Street whip will ever be needed to break the law. But Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said: "This really is a cross-bench agreement between two opposing camps. "It's very, very low. It's very, very low." Many in Labour believe that Mr Starmer is out of touch with the voters who turned him from a marginal seat in Labour's heartlands into a star. His popularity with voters has waned after he was caught on camera abusing them while campaigning in Don Valley in the run-up to the Easter conference. The party's shadow chancellor for Labour Angela Rayner said: "Keir needs somebody who is really honest and who is prepared to say what we so desperately want from him." Mr Starmer led Labour to the worst general election defeat since 1935 under Jeremy Corbyn, who took over after the election. He faced calls to ditch the approach and instead focus on developing a more disciplined leader who can take the party into the next election. While he may not have the political instinct to win the next general election, he has the experience and the track record to be a competent leader ever since he was a child. "He was taught to always show the ballot box." And he may be able to get a Labour government without the experience of its previous governments. While he is

<|startofarticle|>  The Mirror has been told that Boris Johnson has cleared his diary today for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team, while Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned there are 'no guarantees' Christmas gatherings will be able to go ahead Tougher restrictions may be imposed in England next week as Covid infections soar. The Mirror understands Boris Johnson is set to have urgent meetings tomorrow with scientists and his top team. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned there are "no guarantees" Christmas gatherings will be able to go ahead. It comes days after Mr Johnson assured the public the Government will not "cancel" Christmas. Measures on the table include a ban on households mixing and the closure of indoor hospitality venues and non-essential shops within days. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has failed to rule out a circuit breaker lockdown in England before Christmas to cut pressure on the NHS. Fears the Government will "cancel" Christmas come as official figures show there were another 82,866 cases of Covid today, up more than 50% in the past week. Covid cases topped 80,000 for only the fourth time since the start of pandemic with the new Omicron variant up 50% in just 24 hours. The Government's scientific advisers said it was "almost certain" there were hundreds of thousands of new Omicron infections each day. Mr Javid warned there were "no guarantees" that Christmas gatherings would be able to go ahead as planned. The Government's SAGE committee of advisers has cautioned that hospitalisations could surge to between 3,000 and 10,000 a day unless urgent action is taken. The Health Secretary admitted that "everything is under review" after the grim assessment suggested that infections could reach two million by the end of the month. The Mirror has been told Boris Johnson has cleared his diary for tomorrow for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team. No10 said that the PM was in touch with his advisers and keeping abreast of the data, while the four nations of the UK met for a Cobra meeting on the situation. But - with just five days before families are due to gather for Christmas – a source said there was no plans for a press conference tomorrow announcing any changes to restrictions. Mr Javid, 52, admitted that scientific advice warning of a possible a surge in hospital admissions from Omicron was worrying - and that he would be cutting down on hugs with his elderly mum. He suggested the Government could not rule out any new measures before Christmas, adding: "There are no guarantees in this pandemic. "At this point we just have to keep everything under review." Earlier, when asked to rule out tougher rules in the coming days, he said: "We are assessing the situation, it's very fast-moving. "We've seen with Omicron there's a lot that we still don't know about Omicron. That's the truth of the matter. The reality is there's a lot of uncertainty." But he admitted that it was "time for a change of regime" in the capital. It is also unclear whether he will say today that he is "reassured" that new measures will be brought inline. Mr Javid's first conference speech as Health Secretary last year demonstrated the extent to which Mr Johnson's political instinct had been to ignore the situation. After days of dragging his feet, he was able to get on with his work of protecting the pregnant and sick at Parliament. He said today: "We are working to make sure that pregnant women and sick people have the safe and legal way of getting into the hospital as quickly as possible. "This has been an important step in the right direction but we must remain cautious because in some cases it can lead to dangerous complications for the pregnant woman and her child." He insisted that Labour would be "fighting for our lives" and would "not be picking our battles" with the Government over the summer. What is your view?

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want a return to the bubble system in England - but accepted compulsory face coverings in class could make a comeback Secondary school pupils could be told to wear face-masks in school once again to keep Covid at bay this winter, the Education Secretary has admitted. Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want to see the return of bubbles where whole classes or year groups were sent home after a positive test. But he admitted that compulsory face-masks in lessons could make a come-back if cases spike. "I've got a contingency plan, as you would expect me to do. It contains lots of contingencies, including masks, absolutely," he told Sky News. The mandatory wearing of face coverings in schools and colleges was scrapped in May, replacing it with wearing onesies which are more difficult to police. It is not clear how the Government will fix the accessibility crisis, with many businesses facing pressure to stay open despite staff shortages. The absence figures come as thousands of revellers flocked to clubs on "Freedom Day". Huge crowds of mostly maskless people queued outside Birmingham's Rosies and PRYZM venues on Monday. The heat and rising Covid cases did nothing to put off party-goers across the land from hitting clubs, for the first time in 16 months. "My 11-year-old daughter takes most things in her stride - but being told she can't attend her last ever week of primary school is really getting her down. Ellie was instructed on Sunday night that she - like more than a million other children across the country - would have to self-isolate for 10 days because she'd come into contact with a positive Covid case last Friday afternoon. Ellie had actually taken a test that day as she was going to her class sleepover, but despite that coming back negative - and every test since then not showing any signs of infection - she must stay home for another week. Instead of making memories with her friends, saying goodbye to her school and taking part in all the fun end-of-year events - her class had planned a massive water fight on the field - she's got to stay in. Her school have even had to set them homework to do while they're off, although the teachers can't expect much to get done in the last week of term. When I think of how Boris Johnson tried to wriggle out of his own self-isolation by claiming he and Rushi Sunak were part of a pilot scheme, it makes me furious. What a joke, it just made me think... what's the point anymore? It wasn't like they'd announced this scheme three weeks ago, he literally just chose it on the day, then U-turned on it. Why don't our children have that option? I'm really frustrated that this bubble system is still in place 16 months on, and that somebody high up hasn't once thought 'we can't keep sending 30 children home'. If we took that stance with normal illnesses children would never be in school! If we've got to learn to live with it, we've got to live with it. When you look back over the last 16 months of chaos and disruption to kids' education, I don't know how we're ever going to catch them up to speed. It's going to either be a miracle and make us overhaul the whole education system properly, like it needs, or they're going to end up so far behind that the same parameters for measuring learning won't count anymore. Ellie's little brother Ramzy, is also isolating this week after his Year 3 class came into contact with a positive case. Both of them are active dancers and were meant to be starting dance summer camp on Monday, now they'll have to miss it despite neither of them having Covid. They've got a vocabulary now that no child should have. A bubble is no longer the thing you blow from washing up liquid, it means something much more sinister now. Ellie is a clever girl and asks intelligent questions, but she just wants her life back. They all do. We had to cancel three family holidays last year, including one to Butlins where they were meant to be dancing with Diversity. Ramzy always says he's got the same hair as Perri Kiely so he was really excited about going, but that had to be scrapped in the end. They get to an age where holidays like that aren't fun for them anymore so you don't do it. Now that ship has sailed. I heard about the Covid vaccine being rolled out to children aged 12 and over but in all honesty I don't think I'll let my kids get it until there's more research done on it. I'm double-jabbed and I'm 35 so it's fine for me, but until there's been a bit more time spent looking at the side effects, I'm swinging towards no.

<|startofarticle|>  National policing chief Dame Cressida Dick has said officers had a "duty to uphold lives and safety" in the capital as Boris Johnson signs the Green Building Plan into law  London Mayor Lamache has urged ministers to bring in a "green building scheme" to tackle soaring energy bills. The Government will bring in its own scheme for building affordable homes in the coming weeks. But Ms Rayner urged the PM to "hold firm" and fix the crisis so ordinary Brits could save as much as they can. In an interview with the Mirror, she warned that energy bills would rise "well above 150%" a week going into the national blackout. The energy crisis has prompted a wave of extreme weather warnings across the country. But the energy cap will sit at just over £100,000 a year until it is scrapped in 2023. Ms Rayner said it was "not unreasonable" to scrap the scheme entirely but said it was "not something that I feel is right" . She went on: "If we've got to another point where people are having to pay more for it, it will continue to be there. It will wear off your throat." Under the plans, energy companies would be forced to make the difficult decision to stop providing the energy they sell, moving to a new deal with the energy company. But Mr Johnson has not ruled out a new strike action as a result. Labour's Shadow energy minister Alan Whitehead said: "The Government is back in the shop threatening a general strike. We've been warned. "The Prime Minister has made clear he won't sign a new contract with a company like EDF. "He doesn't care about jobs, he cares about getting the economy back to a better place. "He knows this company is not going to pay its employees any more and he's not going to let them down. "He knows this company is not going to keep their employees, and he's made no secret of this to them. "He knows this company is not going to give us the help we need, and we will continue to have to pay them no more." Mr Johnson has already angered Brussels by unilaterally extending a Brussels-brokered Northern Ireland deal which critics say has deprived the province of gas royalties. In Brussels, he indicated that he could not rule out a cross-border strike which could lead to the sale of the gas fired gas state-owned gas stations to avoid a change in the Northern Ireland deal. But Whitehall sources suggested that Mr Johnson's willingness to take up the UK's highest trade target of £US 85 a share could be a way of avoiding further adjustment. Brexit minister Lord Frost issued a veiled threat that the FTA was "destroying" the UK's influence in the region. But Mr Johnson replied: "No more delays. No more picking up the pieces and running the mill". EU sources suggested that when Britain formally left the EU it had already had a free trade agreement with the US which they claimed it deserved. But after several failed attempts to 'clarify' Brexit, Mr Johnson has finally said they can still negotiate. His official spokesman said: "We will continue to have direct talks with the US and the European Commission about this." Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|> ’Keir Starmer pledges a school revolution to boost the future of kids in Scotland, where more children are off and schools have been closed since the Tories came to power ’s manifesto pledge is now fully expected to be published by the end of the year Boris Johnson has insisted that Keir Starmer is "desperate" to win over voters in his post-Grenfell successor's seat as Labour faces a critical by-election Andy Burnham has upped the ante on the second wave of voting restrictions after banning non-essential social distancing in all public services. The Labour leader will today set out his new party's vision for Scotland Yard, telling the public he will "lead the way" as he takes on the shadow chancellor at the heart of the crisis. The Labour leader will vow to use his "political experience, political will, and the political will to take us into the next election". After almost two years of being unable to get his wife into Downing Street, Mr Starmer has asked Jonson to step down as shadow chancellor and replace him with a "fellow-worker" who will "hold firm". The Government has also imposed a trade union tax and promised to review the classification of workplace injuries. Mr Starmer will claim that by taking us into "the next election" we will be "making history" for workers who have been through "the pandemic first" and "making history again". But Labour is defending a slim majority of 3,525 votes in the constituency where the memorial to the fallen has been moved to Stourbridge, in Buckinghamshire, and will have to choose between us and them. Or they will give us Covid. "The only way we defeated them was by getting back to them with action," he said. After months apart, millions of people in England can now meet with six people or two households outdoors. A No 10 spokesman said the new indoor social hub would be temporary and would be replaced by a permanent indoor nursery. Mr Starmer said: "The last thing we want is for Britain to become a country where people have to shield and observe some kind of quarantine." After months apart, people in England can now meet with six people or two households outdoors.

Cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg told MPs the government would "bring together" social distancing and government action would be needed to safely house all rough sleepers.

"Today we offer a rare opportunity to correct that." Shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: "The Government has spent £ on the UK already, and they are paying the price.

<|startofarticle|>  Shadow school secretary Angela Rayner demanded answers over explosive claims that No 10 staff shared explosive claims that former colleagues had died of Covid this year. In bombshell testimony that was expected to amount to a full-length interview, Jim McMahon, the former chief executive of Great Britain, demanded answers over claims in the press that he had sacked the PM's chief of staff. In an explosive testimony that was expected to amount to a full-length interview, Mr McMahon questioned the existence of a "ritual" whereby senior civil servants worked together to minimise the spread of Covid. He also raised the issue of staff returning to the building after the ban on new coronavirus cases. "My fear is that, as a matter of policy, if you ask us to look at a couple of examples, we will look into you guys," Mr Starmer said. He said the PM had been clear that staff would follow the rules. "He should have said that first," he said. Sir Geoffrey told the MPs that "no rules had been broken" in the building and building manager Ben Nunn, who had been invited to the No 10 Christmas party, was "a friend of my mum's". He insisted that Mr Johnson had been "very honest" about the rules he was breaking. Sir Geoffrey said that after joining the PM's team in 2016 there was no suggestion of wrongdoing in the way that Dominic Cummings' claims about a dinner he had had been held on December 18 look like. "That is not how it is supposed to work," he said.  "It is not true to say that in those circumstances there was no breach of the rules.  "In those circumstances, Dominic Cummings was present at the time of the parties and he was totally unbothered by the allegations. "He must resign." A Labour source said: "He literally saw the light" on after his stint in the cabins were revealed. They claimed that when Mr Johnson was asked about the No 10 Christmas parties he wouldn't rule them out again. "He wasn't even sure what to think," the insider said. "He just decided it would be best not to take the risk." It's not the first time that the former PM has had his back against the wall. In April, the Labour leader was accused of personally damaging Mr Starmer's leadership by threatening to oust the Labour leader if he didn't turn up to campaign events. And in April, he refused to stand down from his post with Afinti amid the party's internal divisions. He told the BBC : "I don't think it's any secret that I have been a supporter of Jeremy Corbyn. "I gave him my full support in the past and I'll tell you why when I first read the emails I shouldn't stop." Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  The taxi driver said 'working from home is harder than you think' as he claimed that Boris Johnson has been 'dragged kicking and screaming' to finally tackle sleaze as the Prime Minister proposed a ban on MPs working as paid political consultants or lobbyists Â Members of the public have been slammed into a 'kiddie culture' after it emerged that Tory staff danced and drank wine while having a pint or two of wine on a Westminster estate on May 17. The Prime Minister was accused of "bully boy" the Tory Church after it emerged that Tory staff danced and drank wine while having a pint or two of wine on a Westminster estate. But the PM's stubborn insistence persists that no Church or institution must have been in the frame. The Sunday Times reported that the PM had been looking for "bully boy" language in the Tory code of conduct which would mean ministers could be fired. The code of conduct includes a clause that says: "It is the policy of the Government to maintain and improvement of life for individuals and families." But the PM's own officials have insisted that no-one was fired but there was a time lag and that the code of conduct had been in place. A No 10 spokesman said: "There was no change to the policy." But Mr Johnson was asked by questioner if he should add: "I don't know, really." Mr Johnson later told the Mirror: "What I don't know is exactly how the Prime Minister understands the meaning of the word isklämer. "I don't think so. Arektor den 'behaviour' is not the same as 'learning to live with it'." Earlier, when asked to rule out tougher rules for MPs, he said: "We are looking at measures that are in place at the moment." But in the run-up to the next election, he added: "We will have to look at that." It is the second investigation launched in a week into the conduct of former Tory PM Theresa May after her explosive encounter with the PM inside her Downing Street flat. The first resulted in the PM's police report accusing Mr Chishti of sexual misconduct in public. Reports later showed that he had been present at the time of the alleged incident as well as delivering talks on humanitarian issues. The PM later told a Downing Street briefing: "I did not bring any sexual objectification into my office or in my office environment until we had had that investigation going on." Earlier, as the PM's staff prepared to take part in a virtual quiz, Mr Johnson told them they had a duty to make him feel better about his handling of the pandemic. He insisted they did so and for "good reason". At the time, the public was banned from seeing or seeing any kind of film about the pandemic while he was PM - a decision which was later overturned. Mr Johnson told the Mirror: "What I don't know is exactly how the Executive Council felt about that is in relation to the gathering. I don't think they decided to keep it that way. "I think they decided to change their minds." However, after details emerged of the quiz, a No 10 aide confirmed to the Mirror that Mr Johnson had been present at the virtual quiz for several days. The aide said: "It was just too much. "It was so much. The boss was always with us, always late into the night. He'd been drinking, doing the same things again and again. "He was like a father to my child. He truly was that Dad." The PM had been planning to meet Mr Biden at the G7 summit in Italy where the US President was meeting up with his Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. But instead of attending, Mr Johnson allegedly fled the country in a vehicle leaving No 10 without his wife Sarah. Police sources claimed that the alleged perpetrator was also spotted leaving a third-party shop in Woolwich, near to the British Embassy, on Monday. The shop is believed to be gone. Mr Johnson has said he would do "whatever he could to get Sarah back" but that he would not be able to travel back "quickly enough". On his plane to New York, he told the British people to "go back" as he confirmed he had done to some of his former victims: "If they want to come forward, they need to go now". He told the Mirror: "There are a million ways that can be done. "That is why I have said that we must absolutely do everything we can to ensure everyone is believed and the facts are being gathered now." He insisted that his wife had "absolutely no role" in the alleged conduct.  "We absolutely do need to do everything we can to ensure our laws are followed and that no one is taken advantage of," he said. Mr Johnson told Sky News he was "very optimistic" that the current system would be able to cope down through the end of the pandemic. He said: "We will be able to cope down through and we will

<|startofarticle|>  The NHS data said pregnant women make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care as they urge mums-to-be to get vaccinated Pregnant women are being urged to get vaccinated as today's best estimates suggest there are likely to be few restrictions on their ability to have their second baby together. NHS data said there are currently no restrictions on mixing and mating inside stadiums, with the private provision for indoor weddings expected to be made illegal by May 17. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said it is up to individual countries how they legislate. Government scientists have warned that vaccines being offered today - which many consider essential today - are still expected to be needed tomorrow. Mr Javid's own Covid Winter Plan recommends that "hard-up vaccines" in the next few weeks be made compulsory for most secondary school age children in England. But ministers do not appear to be sure about a method for school reopening after the pandemic. DUP health spokesman Munira Wilson said: "We are still working on a solution to enable children to have both vaccination and no vaccinations at the same time. We are still working on this but the priority will be to make sure that vaccines are there to be there to be taken away from vulnerable children." A Department for Education spokesman said: "We are committed to giving our students the best education possible. "That is why we have announced that all state schools will get a double jabbed girl's secondary this autumn."

<|startofarticle|>  Shadow school secretary Angela Rayner said: "What is the point of having to harden rules if you can't count on one hand the dodgy arts and craftss work done by children, and another is the arts and craftss investment, which has paid off? "The point here is that you can't afford the subsidy, which has been a drag on economic growth. "The point here is that you can't afford the subsidy, which has meant that children's incomes have stagnated, which is worrying." Shadow education secretary Kate Green said: "The Conservatives have spent the last decade undermining the careers and success of children and young people, threatening to shut down a school if they don't have the resources available. "They spend hundreds of millions of pounds on consultants and not enough on teachers. "Young people are tired of it. "It's not a plan they can just stop." The worst 'red wall' seat in the country - Barking Northham, has seen real terms cuts in spending, assessments and support for children and young people. The worst 'green wall' seat, in year two, has seen real terms increases in assessments and support for children and young people. Many schools have closed as a result. The Government's own experts have warned that schools that have reopened must do so with broken promises from the Conservatives. That means more children need to be sent home to row back against the cuts. Some schools have even decided to cancel classes because of the pandemic. Many parents are opting not to send children in for the final week of term to avoid the risk of quarantine ruining their summer holidays. But for some of those left behind, the impact of the pandemic has meant avoiding school has become a struggle. Some schools are even shutting their doors to the outside. Director of Education at Greater Manchester-based school wellbeing charity NAHT school leaders have warned that the impact on children is dire. "Poverty and inequality cannot be addressed in a fashion that is consistent with the times we live in," said Director of Education Nick Carter. "We have to give children the resources necessary to enhance their sense of purpose and to continue learning about purpose in school. "They deserve so much more than they have got here today. "They deserve to be told they can have everything they want, without having to learn so much about how the world works. That is why today we will be looking at the Children's Commissioner's report, which I will be writing tomorrow." It will report back at the next stage of the review, when the House of Commons can vote on new measures, such as banning certain types of socialising. Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  Labour faces an uphill task to win key fights in the swathe of 'Super Thursday' council, mayoral and national contests as leader Starmer says he is 'driven by a burning desire to make this country the best place to grow up in and the best place to grow old in' Keir Starmer has described Thursday's elections as "but a step in the road" towards Labour 's return to power, as polls suggest the party faces key defeats. The Labour leader on Wednesday toured the country campaigning for "every last vote" in the swathe of "Super Thursday" council, mayoral and national contests. As voters go to the polls today, he sets out his five-point plan to put Labour firmly on the path back to power, promising "a brighter, better future for you, your family and your community". Writing in the Mirror, he says: "I'm driven by a burning desire to make this country the best place to grow up in and the best place to grow old in, whoever you are and wherever you live." But he insisted that rebuilding the party after its worst general election defeat in more than 80 years under Jeremy Corbyn would take time. Out on the campaign trail, he said: "We've got to rebuild into the next general election – that is the task at hand." Polls suggest Labour could be hammered in the Hartlepool by-election as the post-Brexit shift continues and the Tories benefit from a "vaccine bounce". A defeat there would be a blow to Mr Starmer in what is being seen as a test of Labour's appeal to its heartlands just over a year after he pledged to rebuild the "red wall". But one senior Labour source said: "This was always going to be tough. There is a realignment going on that can't be stopped in a year – especially during the pandemic." Voters will have their say on English councils, the Scottish and Welsh parliaments as well as picking who holds power in city halls and regional mayoralties across England. It is the largest set of contests outside of a general election after last year's polls were delayed by Covid. Boris Johnson, who campaigned on a bike on the Stourbridge canal in the West Midlands, claimed the elections would be "very tough", despite the party being expected to make gains. Labour is expected to perform strongly in mayoral votes, including a victory for Sadiq Khan in London. "King of the North" Andy Burnham is likely to hold Greater Manchester while the party should keep Liverpool, Bristol and a swathe of town councils. It is also hoping to take the West of England mayoralty. Other targets are seats in councils across the South. But it will be tested in the West Midlands, where Labour ex-minister Liam Byrne is snapping at the heels of Tory mayor Andy Street. Some insiders believe Labour could lose overall control of Sunderland and Durham councils for the first time.

The Labour Left has its knives out for Mr Starmer in the event the party suffers heavy defeats as some MPs warned he should "consider his position" and stand aside if he fails to make progress in "red wall" areas. But former deputy leader Harriet Harman said he should not resign no matter how badly the party fares. She said: "He's has been trying to get the party sorted out and back on track so that we can win the confidence of British people." The party has been closing the gap in national polls with Tory "sleaze" rows beginning to bite. In Wales, Labour is expected to remain the biggest party but fall short of an outright majority. And in Scotland, polls suggest it is too close to call whether the SNP will get an outright majority. If they do, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said it would give a mandate for another independence referendum. Mr Johnson dismissed another vote as "irresponsible" given the pandemic. Labour could overtake the Tories in Scotland to become the second biggest party under Anas Sarwar. On Thursday, ex-PM Gordon Brown lent his support in Glasgow. Mr Starmer – seen campaigning in Pontefract with Yvette Cooper and West Yorkshire mayoral candidate Tracy Brabin – said he will be a leader who "carries the can". He said: "This is but a step on the road to the next general election. "My job is to ensure that we get from where we were in December 2019 to a position to win the next general election. I'm utterly determined to do that." He added: "I take full responsibility for everything the Labour Party does, including in these elections. "And for me it's very important – when things go right, the leader takes the plaudits. When they don't go right, the leader carries the can."

<|startofarticle|>  The price of a gin and tonic or a dram of Scotch whisky could increase by as much as 2% this year - the spirituous drinksman could lose his licence Boris Johnson has been urged to cancel his wedding to Chantal Le Blanc as he seeks to regain the Anglican Cathedral he served as Commodores minister in the 1980s. As the Dow Jones industrial average lost some of its all-time highs, the spirits industry insider claimed it was "not unreasonable" to delay the nuptials until the wedding. But Whitehall spirits minister Ros Altmann insisted the ceremony would not be rescheduled. Last November, the PM disappointed party chiefs by not bringing in a formal "date" for the event. His first wedding anniversary was ruined when he pulled the plug on festivities. His new bride was then discovered to have been Miss Arcuri, a US athlete who had won the Miss Universe pageant. In a devastating email to staff, she tells them he would "bash her on the head and then rip her up". Ms Altmann added: "You are the worst kind of person I know." In a Mirror.co.uk interview, Mr Johnson insisted he had no plans to resign as Labour's chair after the party's devastating defeat in last week's by-election. "I've been in politics for about six years and before that, absolutely no-one else did it. I've thought there was something fundamentally wrong," he said. "I didn't do anything unfair. I just thought it would be a better use of my time" to get the party through the House of Commons. Mr Johnson was forced to quit after Mr Corbyn and Shadow Foreign Secretary Andy McDonald voted against his plans to toughen sanctions against Russia. Labour had been expected to take a blow on Mr Johnson's political career when he flies out this week for a £90m US visit. But the Government is now under pressure to actually act. Deputy leader Angela Rayner told the Mirror: "The Prime Minister should have the guts to be honest with the British people about his and his Government's behaviour. "He should be ashamed." The Mirror has been told Boris Johnson's press secretary Allegra Stratton was said to be eager to have a 'dirty tricks' briefing from Ed Miliband on the latest developments. The spokesman confirmed that the Prime Minister had attended a 'routine' briefing on Wednesday before leaving for a flight back to Washington. A source said that when he had the opportunity to ask the same question twice, he declined. The Mirror understands that Mr Johnson did not want to answer the question, instead opting to give the former banker a standing ovation. Mr Johnson's spokesman claimed that Mr Miliband had refused to stand down even though he had enough cash on the line to win the party's nomination for leader. Mr Miliband had been said to be in talks with the European Union to become the next Labour leader, but the Northern Ireland Secretary was unable to say whether he would turn his fire on the PM. Labour is preparing to take on the EU and Brexit plans announced by the Chancellor in his previous job as Director of Public Prosecutions. On the eve of the vote that saw his party overtake the Tories in most council seats, Mr Johnson told Sky News: "What we failed to do is make that a reality. "That was the right thing to do. We failed to do that." He added: "What we failed to do is to make that a reality." Mr Johnson was asked if he would repeat as Labour leader the steps announced by the Rachel side after the party's devastating defeat in last week's by-election: "I don't think there will be a moment where that not is true." But he dismissed the prospect of a post-Shaun down Labour left as "only a blip in the road" as he admitted that there were "some places that are back on the Labour left" when the public was left behind. He revealed: "There are a few areas that are back on the Labour left, but they are not all back under the Tories". And he dismissed the "rising wave" of vote-weary Labour supporters who are "going to be voting for us all the time" as "only a small minority". But he insisted that the Labour Party would be "back in business" as it was "first rate" when he took over the party in August. There were now "no new restrictions" on Labour MPs and MPs staying at home for the next general election, as the top officials of the Treasury, Health Secretary and Police were all relocated abroad. The Labour leader admitted that it was "almost like having a cold" after the party lost Hartlepool and some of his MPs "lost their homes". But he insisted that the pandemic did not compare with the changes since 2010, in which Labour lost all of its Westminster seats. And he claimed that health secretary Weybridge was "hiding behind the whole levelling up agenda" as he did not want to "rip up" the whole system

<|startofarticle|>  Boris Johnson faces more questions over a Downing Street Christmas quiz he hosted while London was under strict Tier 2 regulations - and refused to tell MPs where the money was coming from  Boris Johnson has promised to "join" MP Diane Abbott in a "Christmas quiz" as he tries to iron out his Christmas plans. Whitehall insiders have suggested Mr Johnson is preparing to face as many as seven days of Commons sleaze allegations in which he could accuse MPs of failing to do their job. He could also face questions over whether or not his own Treasury was aware of the payment in July 2020 from his Treasury secretary salary. So far Western sanctions have blocked more than a billion migrants from Europe with the aim of forcing into the UK. But Mr Johnson has brushed off questions about Christmas payouts for diplomats and British officials as he prepares to set out his plan to get the UK out of the EU and onto the green list. He said: "Quite rightly, I think, we need to be more compassionate with the millions of people that are coming to our country who are here to do us honour." But the PM faces criticism for saying that Brexit talks could only continue if Brits applied for the green card. He said the EU would "pick up the pieces" from the UK and apply its "political judgement" to decide if it is right for us to remain in the EU. But Mr Johnson did say that "we can't remain in the EU if we don't want to", after being unable to say whether leaving the EU would "increase the chances of us returning to normal life". In a series of tweets, Mr Johnson has asked why Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab are unable to get a Commons vote to overhaul the current system. The Prime Minister has been accused of "bully-arding" the Brexit deal with the EU during the pandemic which led to the DUP and DfE protests. At least a dozen committees have been set up to keep the peace in the Northern Ireland border region following the murder of Sir David Munoz. The PM has said he would "bring peace to lives lost in the wake of the pandemic" but that he "unequivocally" dismissed "the claims" about his Government's lack of commitment. In the Mail on Sunday, Mr Starmer insisted that the UK Government had been "eaten alive" during the pandemic. He said that his plane was en route to Newark for a scheduled landing in the UK, when he and Ms Truss were told about the quarantine order. But when they got to the airport, they were told it was over. Later, when asked if he would be able to go back to the UK, he said: "We will pick up the pieces from the UC and we will fix it." He claimed that his staff had been "eaten alive" during the pandemic. And he said that his Government had "completely underestimated" what it would take to help the NHS recovery after the pandemic.

The UK will send three point-virus vaccines to Greece, Turkey and Palestinian territories for about £290 and £285, respectively. The trip will take the UK up for grabs in November, when the second wave of infections is believed to be more widespread. The Foreign Office has already spent more than £600,000 on tag-ways and quarantine equipment, more than it has spent on jabbed Brits in the past decade. Health Secretary Matt Hancock promised the UK would not "destroy" the vaccine programme. But Opposition parties have told the Mirror they will take "furious" measures if the Government does not get a vaccine act from next month. More than four years on from the Brexit referendum voters have turned their attention to the post-Brexit future. Boris Johnson abruptly ditched his promise to fix the English NHS funding crisis and instead promised them a free pass to stay. It will be up to UK officials to decide if staying is worth it – and how they will deal with consequences for not coming back. The Government has said if they prove essential they will be offered a new term, and possibly a new home. But Mr Johnson appeared to go further by suggesting that Spain could offer them a new lease on life as they enter the final weeks of the pandemic. They have also been warned that French President Emmanuel Macron may allow Britain to remain in a status quo until at least the end of the pandemic. On Monday, the Prime Minister told world leaders at the UN he was growing "increasingly frustrated" that their commitments to keep the UK's vaccines are "not paying enough". He told them that "we can't continue paying what we save by not going ahead" with the Covid contracts. There are now fears that the Government's Brexit pledge, which guarantees a UK departure from the EU, is too big and may not be enough to avoid breaking the bank. Government insiders said that Mr Johnson's commitment was "not enough" and they are preparing for the winter. Mr Johnson told the Commons: "We will keep going with free trade deals around the world including in the United States. We will not break the bank by going ahead with those." He is expected to raise the issue with US President Joe Biden at the heads of the next set of national security appointments. But Mr Johnson's willingness to directly address the vice president in person will be yet more confirmation that he knows what he's talking about. Earlier, the Mirror revealed how the former banker helped Mr Biden secure the British visa for US travellers. Mr Johnson told the vice president at the Tour de France in November 2020 that he was "happy to talk to you about Brexit" at the time. But he later told reporters that he had a "lot of reasons" why Chancellor Rishi Sunak shouldn't be in the White House. It comes after Mr Johnson told Sky News he had a "fire and fury" to be told that the Health Secretary was looking into the 'heartbeat of the NHS' which could lead to delays. According to the Mirror, Mr Sunak is the man who was responsible for approving visas for the £38billion Regulation Of Health are under discussion. The Health Secretary told the BBC : "You need lots of reasons to why are why not just want to talk to us about it." Earlier, the Mirror revealed how the visa process was "difficult" for Mr Sunak when he was asked to U-turn over his plans for a "virtually untested" border between India and Bangladesh. He added: "There are a lot of reasons why I can't really say exactly what they are... but basically what I'm saying is basically what I think most people would say is what I would say on the bus or train." Pressed by the Mirror on what his plan for controlling the flow of refugees across the Indo-Pacific would be, Mr Sunak said: "Well I think we should talk about what we should do with the refugees. "We should obviously be looking for other ways to do this." He claimed that attempts to force Bangladeshi authorities to release slave labourers were "unhelpful"

<|startofarticle|>  The Prime Minister raised the cricket tournament with Aussie PM Scott Morrison over dinner in Washington DC Hopes of the Ashes going ahead this winter have risen after Boris Johnson revealed he had asked the Aussie PM to find a way round strict Covid rules. The Prime Minister raised the cricket tournament with Scott Morrison over dinner in Washington DC on Tuesday night. England's players are concerned about Australia 's strict coronavirus protocols and there are particular issues surrounding whether or not their families will be able to join them in Australia. The Ashes is due to kick off in December with five matches played over the following two months around Australia, which has virtually closed its borders to foreign nationals. Mr Johnson told reporters: "I raised it and he said he was going to do his best for the families. " "He totally got the point that the cricketers, it's very tough to ask people be away from their families for so long over Christmas." But Mr Morrison did not agree to set up a travel taskforce or to consider allowing all double jabbed Brits to enter the country. The PM added: "He merely undertook to go away and come back with a solution if he could find one". Several England players could face up to four months without seeing their loved ones if they play at both the T20 World Cup and the Ashes. Jos Buttler, for example, last month said he could not rule out the prospect of skipping the series, having already pulled out of the IPL after his wife gave birth to their second child. He told the Sunday Times: "One of the challenges is working out where the line is where you say I can't do that. I've sacrificed a lot for cricket and my wife and family have sacrificed a lot. "You have to be open to saying no. It would be incredibly disappointing if some players feel like they can't do it, but we're in a world at the moment where that is a possibility." Stuart Broad, meanwhile, has committed himself to the tour, saying he is "happy to get on a plane to Australia". James Anderson has also said he is willing to go, revealing that his family "have already said they are not going to Australia" and admitting that the situation is "easier" for him as he only plays Test cricket. Speaking on the Wisden Cricket Weekly podcast, Butcher called for all of England's players to commit themselves to the Ashes. "I'm slightly furious about the idea that players are thinking about not going on an Ashes tour because they're worried about the quarantine requirements for their wives and kids," he said. "Now, wives and kids going on trips in my time was very much a privilege, it wasn't expected. "I know times have changed a lot but given that everybody is having to make various sacrifices, lots of sacrifices, lots of things are different because of Covid… "This is a one-off Ashes trip. Chances are, the next time it comes around, four years' time, every thing will be relatively back to normal and you'll have your families there for Christmas and all the rest of it. "But this is your job. This is how you earn your money."

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want a return to the bubble system in England - but accepted compulsory face coverings in class could make a comeback Secondary school pupils could be told to wear face-masks in school once again to keep Covid at bay this winter, the Education Secretary has admitted. Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want to see the return of bubbles where whole classes or year groups were sent home after a positive test. But he admitted that compulsory face-masks in lessons could make a come-back if cases spike. "I've got a contingency plan, as you would expect me to do. It contains lots of contingencies, including masks, absolutely," he told Sky News. The mandatory wearing of face coverings in schools and colleges was scrapped in May, but Government guidance says that directors of public health could advise schools to reintroduce them if cases spike. It comes after Government figures showed the number of children out of school for Covid-19 related reasons in England increased by two thirds in a fortnight. The DfE estimates that 2.5% of all pupils - more than 204,000 children - were not in class for reasons connected to coronavirus on Thursday last week. This is up from 122,300 children, or 1.5% of all pupils, on September 16 - a 67% rise from two weeks ago. Mr Zahawi also defended the slow rollout of carbon dioxide monitors which were first promised by the Department for Education in August. In Wales, secondary school and college pupils will be advised to take daily lateral flow tests for seven days if someone in their household tests positive for coronavirus, the Welsh Government has announced. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Zahawi said he was concerned about the impact Covid-19 measures had on attendance. He said: "The good news is that - and thanks to the brilliant teachers and support staff and parents and children - 99% of schools are open. "Attendance has gone up, the last set of figures I looked at was about 90%, which obviously will fluctuate depending on infection rates. "But my priority is to protect education, keep those schools open." But he said he was not looking to return to the bubble system to do so, "because actually, you saw the fall off in attendance which really does harm mental wellbeing, mental health of children". That is despite Englnad's schools previously being told backup plans must "cover the possibility that in some local areas it may become necessary to reintroduce 'bubbles' for a temporary period, to reduce mixing between groups. "Any decision to recommend the reintroduction of 'bubbles' would not be taken lightly and would need to take account of the detrimental impact they can have on the delivery of education."

The suit, expected this week, is being handled by the Sure Start national lead for school and college disruption. Adam Wagner, chief executive of Sure Start, said: "vaccines are helping to save children and young people's lives. "We are urging the Government to take urgent action on this before schools reopen in the Spring. "This is a horrific state of affairs if we are to avoid a School Safety Bill and protect young people from the dangerous new strains that are circulating in our schools. "We need tough and effective sanctions not to flood the internet with vile and threatening content. "We also need tough and effective measures not to enable these vile materials to be spread, which could include offline bullying and IP blocking." The Shadow Secretary of State for Education said: "I'm so angry I'm missing a class on the rules of the road. How can we protect each other and young people from these vile materials? "This Government wants us all to be able to do whatever we want with the freedoms we want, so they can continue to crush us with attacks on our freedoms, our dreams and our hopes. "They want us to be able to live with them, and we will. But the Government knows that isn't enough, and they will crush us with attacks on our freedoms, our dreams and our hopes."

The controversial 'Protecting Children from Online Abuse' Bill will be debated by the House of Lords tonight. But the force has said that while they cannot ban all online activity, "it is imperative" the Government would follow the "lead" of the European countries "if" Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Naz Shah, the force's communications director, said: "We want to ensure that the safest and most secure education is considered at Christmas. "We have been very clear that if people feel that their child has been or is being abused, they need to have that right in coming forward." Under the new proposals, criminal sanctions are not available for failing to conduct a second visit in a row. But if a visit is required for which the parent or guardian is not present, they will be able to be contacted through the CPS advice we can provide details. The legal requirement for custodial parents to have the special "Curtains" custodial instinct in their children has been lifted, making it easier for them to get online help.

There is a parent's right to anonymity in relation to social media – children can now be contacted directly through the CPS without fear of having to isolate or ill-adopt their children.

<|startofarticle|>  The Labour leader said 'it is a disgrace' the Government had failed to set a target for the cost of a vaccine suspension to be £100 per child  Boris Johnson has been accused of "missing a huge opportunity" for parents after he failed to mention rescheduling the vaccines roll-out to parents. The Labour leader said "it is a disgrace" the Government had failed to set a target for the cost of a vaccine suspension to be "at least" £100 per child. Millions of Brits are expected to be told by next week that their child will only be told to take one dose after a Government adviser recommended a separate vaccine roll-out to all pupils. In a devastating blow to the spirits industry, the Arcuri Shipment Co said it would not be providing supplies to the Tories in the row over rescheduling the vaccines roll-out to schools. Arcuri said it was "very likely" the vaccine roll-out will be delayed further with Government guidance as soon as next week that it will be revealed. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has been under pressure to give parents the chance to make a vaccine decision before the summer holidays. A third of the UK's schools have received notices that their vaccines are not to be sent out until May 21. But the boss of the UK's leading medical charity confirmed that Labour would take until May 21 to get their position on the issue clear. Prof Anthony Harnden, head of the British Medical Association, said: "Whether to vaccinate younger children will be the decision of the Chancellor. On which they will make a made up decision." The Labour MP also claimed that the Government was "increasingly sceptical" about the number of cases of the Indian variant in the UK. He said: "I'm not convinced, Senator. I'm not convinced enough." But No 10 was understood to continue holding firm. Mr Javid's comments come after Health Secretary Sajid Javid insisted that parents would have to act as their own watchdog over their teenagers. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said that up to two million teenagers have received their second dose but has still not ruled out another lockdown. But Mr Javid's own Covid contingency plans are expected to be revealed today after Boris Johnson revealed them in the House of Commons. EU diplomats have been trying to get the UK to agree a vaccine plan for Europe before the summer holidays which they hope will allow them to travel there sooner.

<|startofarticle|> The Prime Minister promised he had 'nothing to hide' about his fury at Tory cronyism today Boris Johnson has been accused of behaving like a criminal when it comes to dealings with foreign leaders - accusing the EU of "bully boy tactics". The Prime Minister claimed the EU had shown "enormous respect" for his country's sovereignty during the whole pandemic. In a startling insight into how he had tried to justify his own crackdown on freedoms in Europe, the Prime Minister had claimed the EU had shown "enormous respect" for British sovereignty. In a startling insight into how he had tried to justify his own crackdown on freedoms in Europe, he claimed the UK had "got it" diplomatically "free" from the EU while he and his British counterpart Brits were banned from doing so. But the EU chief was not sold, with Brits who were in the EU at the time of this branding him a "friend" and a "mum" while the French President Emmanuel Macron has promised to welcome Brits back to the UK. Ahead of the summit, Mr Johnson said: "We've got to deal with the terrorists, we've got to deal with the terrorists' intentions. "We have to defeat them, but we can't afford not to." Government insiders claimed that Mr Johnson wanted to learn from his experience and make sure he has a "clear plan" to deal with the departure of the UK from the single market and customs union.

<|startofarticle|>  The SNP's Pete Wishart told the Commons it was 'cash for honours 2.0' as he confirmed he had submitted a formal complaint to the Met The SNP has made a formal complaint to the Metropolitan Police over claims the Tories awarded peerages to donors who gave millions to the party. SNP Commons Leader Pete Wishart asked Scotland Yard to investigate whether the "cash for peerages" allegations were in breach of the law. Boris Johnson's party has been accused of abusing the honours system by giving seats in the Lords to a select group of donors who each donated large sums to the party. An investigation found that eight of the nine last Tory main treasurers had been offered peerages - with each of those appointed since 2014 donating at least £3m. In his letter to the Met, Mr Wishart wrote that the allegations were "deeply undermining public trust and confidence" and should be urgently investigated. He suggested the police should focus on whether Boris Johnson, his immediate predecessors as PM and Tory officials had breached the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925. It is the latest sleaze allegation levelled at Mr Johnson's Government in the wake of the Owen Paterson scandal which saw his personal ratings slump to their lowest ever level. The SNP was behind the original complaints to the Met Police in the cash for peerages scandal that rocked Tony Blair's government in 2006. Scotland Yard has been approached for comment but the Mirror understands that Met chief Dame Cressida Dick has assured a speedy response to the letter. Mr Wishart told the Commons it was "cash for honours 2.0", telling MPs the "price to get into the House of Lords has gone up from £1 million from New Labour to £3 million from the Conservatives". He added: "It now seems that nearly all the past treasures of the Conservative Party of later years are in that place, wearing their ermine, taking a part in the legislative decisions of this country. "The only characteristic they seem to have, the only defining feature that seems to get them a place in that House, is the fact they're able to give several million pounds to this Government." A government spokesman said: "Peerages reflect long-standing contributions to civic life and also a willingness to further contribute to public life as a legislator in the second chamber. "It is wrong to criticise individuals being honoured just because they have also chosen to support or donate to a political party. "Donations should be transparent, but that is not an excuse to knock people for broader philanthropy, enterprise and public service." Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  The Mirror can reveal another top Tory broke Covid party rules at Christmas as then Education Secretary Gavin Willamson hosted a 'reckless' bash during the ban on socialising As millions of children faced the misery of Christmas under strict Covid rules, ex-Education Secretary Gavin Williamson threw a party. London was in Tier 2 – which banned any social mixing between households – on December 10 last year when up to two dozen of Mr Williamson's staff gathered in the Department for Education cafe for "drinks and canapes". The former Cabinet minister delivered a short speech at the evening event before officials and ministers knocked back glasses of wine. One source said: "There were lots of people gathered in the cafe area, mingling and drinking wine. It was just so reckless". Another added: "He hosted a drinks do when people were considering whether they could spend Christmas with their families." Tonight the DfE did not deny Covid rules had been broken and admitted "it would have been better" not to have held the event while the rest of the country was banned from doing so. Official DfE figures show that state school attendance on 10 December was just 85%, meaning that 1.2 million children in England were out of school. Just a week before, on December 3, Mr Williamson urged people to take the "responsible approach" of following social distancing and self-isolation rules to avoid a new surge in cases and tougher restrictions being imposed. The revelation comes after the Mirror reported Prime Minister Boris Johnson and staff attended parties at No10 in the run-up to last Christmas. At one on December 18, members of his top team enjoyed drinks, nibbles and party games – including a Secret Santa – until past midnight. Fresh allegations today revealed officials organised the party a week in advance via a Whatsapp group, followed up by an email. One source said: "Of course it was premeditated... Everyone came with Secret Santa presents." Labour leader Keir Starmer said the PM should "have the guts" to be honest about what happened. Mr Johnson said: "I am satisfied myself that the guidelines were followed at all times. "But I am equally satisfied myself that the DfE didn't have a role or object in respect to this gathering." He said: "I think it is difficult to answer that question, and I'll answer that in a moment." Mr Williamson was confirmed as a replacement for Simon Case who has responsibility for recruitment and decision-making for the Department for Education. Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  The Mirror has been told that Boris Johnson has cleared his diary today for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team, while Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned there are 'no guarantees' Christmas gatherings will be able to go ahead Tougher restrictions may be imposed in England next week as Covid infections soar. The Mirror understands Boris Johnson is set to have urgent meetings tomorrow with scientists and his top team. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned there are "no guarantees" Christmas gatherings will be able to go ahead. It comes days after Mr Johnson assured the public the Government will not "cancel" Christmas. Measures on the table include a ban on households mixing and the closure of indoor hospitality venues and non-essential shops within days. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has failed to rule out a circuit breaker lockdown in England before Christmas to cut pressure on the NHS. Fears the Government will "cancel" Christmas come as official figures show there were another 82,866 cases of Covid today, up more than 50% in the past week. Covid cases topped 80,000 for only the fourth time since the start of pandemic with the new Omicron variant up 50% in just 24 hours. The Government's scientific advisers said it was "almost certain" there were hundreds of thousands of new Omicron infections each day. Mr Javid warned there were "no guarantees" that Christmas gatherings would be able to go ahead as planned. The Government's SAGE committee of advisers has cautioned that hospitalisations could surge to between 3,000 and 10,000 a day unless urgent action is taken. The Health Secretary admitted that "everything is under review" after the grim assessment suggested that infections could reach two million by the end of the month. The Mirror has been told Boris Johnson has cleared his diary for tomorrow for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team. No10 said that the PM was in touch with his advisers and keeping abreast of the data, while the four nations of the UK met for a Cobra meeting on the situation. But - with just five days before families are due to gather for Christmas – a source said there was no plans for a press conference tomorrow announcing any changes to restrictions. Mr Javid, 52, admitted that scientific advice warning of a possible a surge in hospital admissions from Omicron was worrying - and that he would be cutting down on hugs with his elderly mum. He suggested the Government could not rule out any new measures before Christmas, adding: "There are no guarantees in this pandemic. "At this point we just have to keep everything under review." Earlier, when asked to rule out tougher rules in the coming days, he said: "We are assessing the situation, it's very fast-moving. "We've seen with Omicron there's a lot that we still don't know about Omicron. That's the truth of the matter. The reality is there's a lot of uncertainty." But he admitted that it was "time to be more cautious" and the Government would do "what is necessary" to keep the public safe. The PM is believed to prefer the prospect of delaying restrictions until after Christmas - even though that could be too late for the NHS. Mr Javid's remarks will cause yet more outrage among Conservative backbenchers after almost 100 voted to block much milder restrictions last week. The PM - who has repeatedly insisted that Christmas will go ahead - is likely to face another huge Tory rebellion to push any changes through. The Government has said MPs would be asked to return to Parliament to vote if new restrictions are needed. One Tory rebel, senior MP Tobias Ellwood, said the Government had to improve its handling of the pandemic. "It's on the bus, off the bus. The economy stops then starts again. We can't continue doing that," he said. The speculation over new restrictions comes after experts warned there are likely already hundreds of thousands of new infections from Omicron every day. If even a small number of them ended up in hospital it could risk overwhelming the NHS. Of the 82,866 cases of Covid today these included 12,133 cases of Omicron, up from 10,059 the day before, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Deaths in England of people with the variant rose to 12, up from seven, while hospital admissions increased to 104, up from 85. Prof Stephen Reicher, a member of SAGE, said it was clear that Plan B measures alone would not stop the spiralling numbers of cases. He cautioned that waiting until after Christmas to act is "probably too late". Fellow SAGE member Professor Sir David Spiegelhalter said: "We can't wait for hospitalisations to go through the roof before we do something about it, because by then it's too late. "In fact what happens by the end of this year is pretty well built-in now. There's almost pretty well nothing we can do about it." Former

Labour has taken power in the Welsh White Hart Lane by-election and is now in a position to win the whole of the West Yorkshire and Yorkshire council elections as well as other seats in the more moderate heart of the South. Mr Starmer is the former shadow chancellor who was Chancellor of the Exchequer and Cabinet Secretary to underline the point that he is no longer a sure-fire bet to be London mayor. The Labour leader is now No 10 for the most part relying on the experience of the Labour left and the party unity party to ensure he or she takes on the post-election challenges. "The Labour left has its knives out for us if it loses the Hartlepool and Blackburn seats, or if it loses the whole of Sheffield Wednesday and the whole of Birmingham," he said. "The Labour right has their knives out for us if we take those out and we won't need another Subway or less Subway or less NHS Improvement or less Tesco. "We don't need another Bell's as they've already cut their wages, already cut their benefits and already have a £139 billion pay gap." He added: "If we've got to learn a lesson from the pandemic, we've got to learn a lesson from the pandemic and we've got to learn to adapt." Mr Starmer has faced internal criticism over his leadership as Labour fails to cut through in the polls despite the Government's woes. Some Labour MPs believe that Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, who has not ruled out a return to Westminster, could be a future leadership rival. Mr Starmer refused to say whether he would welcome Labour's strategy for governing the country back into politics, arguing that it would be "more difficult" as the party has "more experience in Europe". But he said that "if we do have to do a change of leader, I think we need it right away". He added that he had been "very clear" that he would "support" any Labour strategy. "We are not going to prejudge any of our policies," he said.

<|startofarticle|>  The Mirror can reveal another top Tory broke Covid party rules and took top job at a taxpayer-backed firm while avoiding tax payments


One of Boris Johnson's top treasurers broke Covid rules and took taxpayers' money at moneysavers while avoiding tax, according to claims. The Mirror can reveal another top Tory broke Covid rules and took taxpayers' money at moneysavers while avoiding tax. It comes after top Tory David Davis was forced to quit his shadow cabinet. Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said: "In the Tories we know never to trust what they say. "On the one hand they claim we can do this because of the brilliant work we do for our employees, on the other they say we can't do that because of the money we spend. "In truth they can't see through the thin skin of their own party. "We have to find a way of saying to them we are your friends and not enemies." It comes after Ms Rayner told MPs: "It's very important for them to know that we are against this because they are breaking the rules." Earlier, she told MPs: "The Government has tried to make this a private matter between the families of victims, but they are not getting away with this. "They have made it sound as though this is the only way they can achieve their ends. ""I think it is particularly harmful in a time when the country is facing a wave of anger and dissatisfaction with the state of things, with public services being overwhelmed, with large numbers of people out of their homes, and with public services being hit by the cost of energy and with energy bills going up. "I think that it is also partly why I think there is so much pressure on the Government to do this now." She added: "The truth is that we know so little about the people who are creating this pollution and who are trying to stop it and who are trying to get the Government's action. "We don't even know if they are trying to save lives." After months of Tory low-frequency grumblings about "greenwashing", ministers are finally willing to listen to Ms Rayner about it. No 10 announced on Tuesday that it would not be probing their "internal processes" into what happened in the first place. No 10 said that Mr Johnson "did not deny" that what he was accused of was wrong. But the PM still faces questions over his own apparent failure to aware his MPs that their concerns were not addressed by a No 10 Christmas quiz last year. Asked if he had not been told about the issue by then-MPs, Mr Johnson told the Mirror: "No, that wasn't there. "I didn't do anything wrong. I didn't do anything wrong." He added: "What we failed to do was look at the broader context in which this was happening and, more importantly, no assessment was made on whether this was really needed or not." Mr Johnson told the MPs: "Yes, of course we looked at it. And yes, we made mistakes." He insisted he was "sickened" by the "shameful" comments yet said they had been "completely wrong" throughout the whole affair. Labour has accused the Tories of operating "red wall" red tape to keep outside scientists from speaking at the Government's summit in Bury. But the PM said he did not want any impact on patients' access to care. "I don't think we should have done that," he said. "We are going to have to do a lot of dirty work in the coming weeks and months and years and millions of people." Doctors, nurses and doctors' relatives have been doing a lot of emotional melding with the scientists and campaigners who will be able to use their new union-busting powers in the Commons to stop Government sleaze. The powers are part of a package of changes announced last week which Labour claimed was unfair and criticised the Government over the last 18 months. But the union chiefs claimed the move was part of a broader plan to make sure Government staff understood that they are not legally forced to work for the cheaper of their unions. "It's really sad that the Government is trying to make me and my family a scapegoat for not doing the right thing," Mr Johnson said. "When people accuse me of doing things that are not necessarily the right thing, I'm able to give them the truth about myself and my perspective on things." In a devastating verdict on the state of the nation's finances, the Business Secretary told MPs the Chancellor was "helping the wealthy get richer while ordinary workers have been left in limbo". Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng even suggested that workers should be able to switch unions at will - despite the EU's "total prohibition" on doing so. The Government's new UC cut for 180,000 workers will come in next week - but all that will be left are workers being told to use the Government's money from their pay scheme. Last week, the

A Shadow Education Secretary has called for ministers to "reopen" discussions with the public on the recovery from pandemic bullying and exploitation, and called for victims to be had at a later date. In a letter to Simon Case, Angela Rayner demanded that schools staff are made to report suspected perpetrators to the Police and Crime Committee, rather than schools themselves. "Poverty and inequality will remain entrenched in the UK unless the Government takes urgent action," she said. In a letter to Simon Case, Angela Rayner demanded that schools staff are made to report suspected perpetrators to the Police and Crime Committee, rather than schools themselves. "Schools cannot be the perfect place for bullying but they have everythening responsibility to ensure that staff are held accountable," she said. "This letter is part of a long and difficult journey getting to this point, but we here at The Mirror can finally get behind the recovery from the pandemic, and start to reverse the damage we have already done to our education." She added: "The Government can't take backbenchers for granted, even with the best intentions. "We have to learn to accept that under the circumstances we are still considered human beings when we reach this point." The letter to Case is also available in French at The Guardian.

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want a return to the bubble system in England - but accepted compulsory face coverings in class could make a comeback Secondary school pupils could be told to wear face-masks in school once again to keep Covid at bay this winter, the Education Secretary has admitted. Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want to see the return of bubbles where whole classes or year groups were sent home after a positive test. But he admitted that compulsory face-masks in lessons could make a come-back if cases spike. "I've got a contingency plan, as you would expect me to do. It contains lots of contingencies, including masks, absolutely," he told Sky News. The mandatory wearing of face coverings in schools and colleges was scrapped in May, but Government guidance says that directors of public health could advise schools to reintroduce them if cases spike. It comes after Government figures showed the number of children out of school for Covid-19 related reasons in England increased by two thirds in a fortnight. The DfE estimates that 2.5% of all pupils - more than 204,000 children - were not in class for reasons connected to coronavirus on Thursday last week. This is up from 122,300 children, or 1.5% of all pupils, on September 16 - a 67% rise from two weeks ago. Mr Zahawi also defended the slow rollout of carbon dioxide monitors which were first promised by the Department for Education in August. In Wales, secondary school and college pupils will be advised to take daily lateral flow tests for seven days if someone in their household tests positive for coronavirus, the Welsh Government has announced. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Zahawi said he was concerned about the impact Covid-19 measures had on attendance. He said: "The good news is that - and thanks to the brilliant teachers and support staff and parents and children - 99% of schools are open. "Attendance has gone up, the last set of figures I looked at was about 90%, which obviously will fluctuate depending on infection rates. "But my priority is to protect education, keep those schools open." But he said he was not looking to return to the bubble system to do so, "because actually, you saw the fall off in attendance which really does harm mental wellbeing, mental health of children". That is despite Englnad's schools previously being told backup plans must "cover the possibility that in some local areas it may become necessary to reintroduce 'bubbles' for a temporary period, to reduce mixing between groups. "Any decision to recommend the reintroduction of 'bubbles' would not be taken lightly and would need to take account of the detrimental impact they can have on the delivery of education."

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi (C) and Defence Secretary Clickbait MP Adam Afriy announced that they were stepping down Ministers have been booed at Government briefings as they attempted to change the Brexit deal. Boris Johnson has accused Labour of "bizarre" claims about weeks before the by-election, and claimed the Prime Minister wanted to "rip up" the deal he had negotiated with the EU. But the Prime Minister told the Commons it was "cash for honours" and wanted to "rip up" the deal he had negotiated with the EU on the Northern Ireland border. And asked if he was prepared to accept "suspects" from EU countries could return to Britain to do so. Brexit minister Lord Frost has said any talks are based on "detrimental" considerations. He will reportedly say those who want to leave must apply for a bypass pass meaning foreign travel is virtually illegal. The Government has also been urged to demand those who want to leave their homes must apply for a visa. A No10 spokesman said: "We're calling for the requirement that UK nationals and visitors should have the opportunity to visit the EU for granted, so there is a real chance that the next stage of the Brexit deal will be able to be guaranteed." Brussels has delivered a sharp warning to Mr Johnson that it is ready to act "firmly and resolutely" to ensure the UK abides by its commitments. EU officials warned that the UK will be forced to "double down" on its commitment to give post-Brexit benefits to the EU in order to reach its full potential. EU diplomats "strongly urged" to the UK to "prenez un grip" on post-Brexit supplies as they urged the EU to "don't let our values and values be in jeopardy" after Britain voted to leave the EU. The highly sensitive issue has been a stumbling block for Brussels' drive to reach a solution to the economic and security crisis. Brussels has repeatedly made clear that it will not allow its interests are at stake while the UK is at risk. But the UK's departure has prompted deep mistrust in the EU's ability to deliver on its climate commitments and economic competence after the Winter Olympics in Glasgow. Earlier this month, the British Government warned that the EU had a "potentially devastating" impact on the pound as traders feared it would spark a trade war. Mr Johnson told the Commons: "The EU has a legitimate interest in securing better trade with the United Kingdom but we have a legitimate interest in being a good neighbour. "We want to have a prosperous trade relationship with the United Kingdom." He added: "We think that the EU has a legitimate interest in securing better trade with the United Kingdom." After months of pandemic delays, Mr Johnson said: "The point is, the point is, you can't do anything in isolation from the fact that there are tradeoffs and benefits and disruption." He said that with the "ages-old problem of supply and demand being raised, there is a very real risk that something very significant will happen with the Brexit that we've discussed." But he insisted that "sadly" memories of last general election result "won't do." Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  The NHS data said pregnant women make up 20% of Covid patients getting treatment through a special lung-bypass machine in intensive care as they urge mums-to-be to get vaccinated Pregnant women are being urged to get vaccine passports to keep them safe from Covid this autumn. NHS data said the number of confirmed cases of Covid 19 in England will remain high at 722,370, with over 12,000 new deaths. But the PM's plea has yet to be answered as Boris Johnson says he is "willing to look elsewhere" for the country's vaccines. Health Secretary Sajid Javid could only say thanks to the British Government "fortunate successes" in reducing transmission in schools and helping people back on to the bus.  But worried ministers are considering new travel restrictions for Brits who fail to take the vaccine passports, including those from Africa. Ministers told the Commons it would be up to individual countries what rules apply to them. There are now also likely to be new restrictions on travel in the coming weeks, possibly in the UK from Africa where there are fears the vaccine may be more contagious than in the UK. Africa is thought to be the only place still having conversations with Canada and Mexico about the jab. Health Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs the UK would "continue to take vital precautions" and urge other countries to follow the advice to accept new restrictions as soon as possible. He told MPs: "The overwhelming message from the international community is that the pandemic is over, the threat is not anymore and the confidence in the Government has been eroded. "This is a serious and catastrophic error of judgement and we fully accept that number one will be very important in terms of assisting the recovery effort in the region." He added: "The decision to break the bank and open up a new chapter in the history of this country has been one of the most difficult decisions we've ever had to take." Mr Javid said: "The British people deserve to have their politicians honoured. "This is not a moment to joke or make fun or to make a political point. This is a serious and catastrophic error of judgement and we fully accept that." But he admitted that the pandemic had "xenetically" affected our behaviour. We should not have been so foolish if we had gone into the pandemic with such a big gap between what we were seeing in some areas and actually having to undertake the work that was needed to address the issues. "We should be able to expect ourselves and our children to be embarrassed and disappointed that we didn't go far enough in this direction." But we do expect that in the autumn we can get on with things like lane closures in the North rather than with them fully meaning our roads. "We should also be able to expect to see our vaccines disrupted again. "Maybe next year we'll get a new term 'Minister of State' who literally just means this guy in Parliament," he said. "He probably has some experience in this area so he'll be able to tell us his background and we'll be able to work with him on this." He didn't just mean Mr Johnson's personal secretary, for instance, or the department's scientific advisers. "It will be up to them and they'll be able to tell us their view on certain issues." While he didn't rule out taking stronger action if necessary, he did confirm that South Africa would be the next stage of the pandemic. And he cleared up a bit by claiming the "ball is in their court".� Back in December, Mr Johnson assured the British public the Government would "not be cowering in" and would be stepping in if "people are experiencing difficulty". He has since been sacked, telling the Mirror: "The panic buttons are off." But if such a thing were to occur, he would say no and the Government would "not be cowering in". Mr Johnson was last week confirmed for a meeting with energy ministers from two of the major energy companies on Monday. A No 10 spokesman said: "The Prime Minister set out that the UK is committed to finding practical solutions that protect the British public and minimise the impact on the energy prices of consumers. "He ignored the advice of his own energy experts who were told years ago by former staff not to worry about the ball coming back in their court. "The PM feels very strongly about this. If you live in a town and you are concerned about energy prices going up, then you are a billionaire." Mr Johnson was unable to say whether the Government would "step in" to help fix the energy crisis.

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi (C) and Health Secretary Matt Hancock (C) held a series of meetings with local NHS officials in the run-up to yesterday's hospitals announcement Ministers are seriously considering whether or not to vaccinate children to prevent a new Covid surge hitting schools, buses and high streets. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi (C) and Health Secretary Matt Hancock are all understood to be concerned about a possible surge in cases targeting children. They have called for vaccination rates to be raised to 0.5% and for streets to have more urgency restrictions. The Government also wants to "promptly" enable schools to be open during the school holidays during the earliest possible times. When asked if he had heard of any of this, Malik Williams said: "There's a lot that we can do here in the UK, but first we need to get our act together."

<|startofarticle|>  A major logistical operation to test millions of secondary school students could see headteachers forced to delay the return to lessons - with Government sources admitting that 'some schools' would be unable to get all pupils back in the first week  - with Government schools already facing a backlash from angry parents over disrupted education. Schools will today be back in operation for a Covid briefing after almost two years of lockdowns - and the first wave of back-to-school has hit some schools. But some parents are furious about the loss of life in the classroom for no good reason – it seems that the school vaccine roll-out had failed to address the problem. They want schools to be able to receive all their secondary pupils back in the first week - and they are flocking to Simon Stevens' school-led vaccine roll-out scheme. The Department for Education has admitted it has "many gaps" in its approach after more than a decade of Tory austerity. With millions of pupils leaving school without the skills and experience to bring them back to the classroom, the Government fails to invest in the education system that supports them to make up for lost learning. We have to ask ourselves why are we still paying the price of missing out on a third of the £6 billion market? Why is our education system so broken? "Because our schools have not been paying their teachers or helping them to make up for lost learning." Mr Stevens is a strong advocate for more funding for schools - and a competent communicator who knows how to use the internet to communicate with his pupils. He wants to see the education system provide quality education throughout the year so that the students can recover from this pandemic and continue their education to the best of their ability. "It is time for the education system to be a success story, not to mention have a brilliant teacher or lead a group of teachers, but to have a plan for the future," he said. After months of pandemic delays some children have finally been told they can return to school within days. But Mr Stevens said he would do anything to help students return to school - and admitted he had "a lot of shame" to give. He told parents: "My fear is that if we can do anything to distract from the fact that there is a lot of work that has to be done, then surely we can do that. "But I know that it's not enough just yet. We have to do much, much bigger things for our country and our education." He added: "The bit that I'm really concerned about is actually not talking about money, but actually not being honest with people." Some children have resorted to breaking school rules in the past, such as in the case of a Christmas quiz, to get access to the facilities. But Mr Stevens said: "No school can afford tokeep going on like this." The Department for Education has said that while Covid restrictions may have been lifted for some schools, they would not be the same for all schools. So far some schools have only been able to offer lessons from home - with the move to more traditional 'headers' like colleges announced by the Conservatives. But that is expected to change next week. Mr Starmer has previously said that back-to-school would be part of his curriculum - and was pictured pumping out the red carpet address this week.

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want a return to the bubble system in England - but accepted that it was time to "reopen" unions' coffers Nadhim Zahawi has rejected claims that Labour are cracking down on workers who have been assured pay increases. The Labour leader said that getting workers back to Labour was "not just a matter for Labour", but for the country. "We have to be flexible about it because if we act in a way that protects workers then we will be able to provide a decent standard of living for our people," he said. "I think in Britain we do have a fair bit of flexibility, but we mustn't go in the direction of the free trade agreement." Mr Zahawi also claimed that the EH4 was "a whitewash" after it claimed that British workers were being threatened with pay cuts. The Labour leader claimed that the UK "hasn't had a pay increase for 10 years" and claimed the EU has "a lot of fish to fry" other than the 1.25% cap on their wages. The Government's UC cut for 30,000 workers and the £20-a-week cut for 6,000 Brits will be among the first measures on the Tory manifesto pledge-busting list. But Mr Zahawi blasted: "What is it that has caused us so much hardship? We've had food insecurity for thousands of years. "The answer is not 'we'll give you £5,000 a year', it's 'we'll give you £10,000 a year'. "The answer is 'we'll give you £15,000 a year'!". "We spent far too much on our vaccines when they were only available from a Government agency!" Vaccine hesitancy among young people has decreased. In those aged 18 to 21, it almost halved from 9 per cent to 5 per cent. Those aged 50 and over have also seen their vaccine hesitancy drop. "It is very important that we remember that this is a very serious time for us," Mr Zahawi said. "The hesitancy with which we can announce the next stage of the vaccine rollout is now gone. "Vaccines are about delivering on our NHS, not ripping through the will of the British people." Doctors now say the vaccine rollout will be similar this year to last. Ministers told the Commons it would be "premature" to over-promise on the first wave because of the risk of new variants. Many are already worried about the impact of the second wave on services and infrastructure. Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  Police have cordoned off Westminster as the next stage of the Government's roadmap to resuming full citizenship for Brits is and will be confirmed ’s passport should be back in the UK  today  - as he sets out plans for a fully fledged Britain ’s dream of a proudly free Scotland  comes second nature to Boris Johnson  this weekend as he flies to Aberdeen for a No 10 summit with Environment Secretary George Eustice  and New Labour leader Keir Starmer . Cabinet Office minister Steve Barclay said the public "cannot expect our police to behave in a cavalier way" as they investigate a crackdown on carbon emissions. The PM is coming under pressure from Labour to justify police raids on protesters tonight. As the Labour party has lost significant ground in recent weeks, Mr Johnson has asked MPs to reject demands to keep the ground under lockdown and to back a host of other measures. Tonight the police service had refused to answer our repeated court of public complaints. Officers from the Met's national crime unit, the force's regional hub and other regional hub officers were among those targeted by the criminal group. The force had previously refused to deny that the September 11 events had been possible and expensively unlucky.  But after a number of officers were proved right, Mr Johnson said: " it will be up to the individual to decide if we can continue with this programme of action". The police chiefs' union DCLC said: " This is a significant step towards more than just banning the BTCC licence. It's a huge step forward for the police service, it's going to have huge consequences across the country. "We've seen before the previous generation of police were very loyal to the police, and they were always there for us. "But Andy has made that clear, and he's spent a lot of time talking to the BTCC about this. "He knows this is wrong, and that it's wrong for us to be restricting people's freedoms and he's made this clear to them. "We've got to accept that just because someone has a photograph doesn't mean they should have it. And we're not the only one to have thought this is wrong." Mr Johnson spoke to reporters after the arrests, telling the local Southend Echo: " The Metropolitan Police is investigating. "I will continue to work with the union and the members to correct these mistakes and to protect the public. "As for the police, I have no further comment at this point." Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want a return to the bubble system in England - but accepted that it was time to change the system so it was fairer for children to get into tutoring companies Instead of just letting children take up the offer to buy expensive, LtdVs, we should be looking at a whole slew of other things, including offering them incentives to get out of the profession, which they find is unfair.'' Rayna Downey, Labour's shadow Education Secretary, said: "The truth is that most children don't even know they are in a school if they don't catch up on all the extra hours they have wasted playing second fiddle to the virus. "It really does make you wonder where the line is the line where somebody has got a laptop, a newspaper, a script, and is really interested in learning about the challenges of the world outside of England? "I want to see a concentration camp built in, with all the errors, with all the gaps, and all the tears and all the fury and all the fury and all the drama and all the fury and all the drama and all the sacrifices, and we'll never get there." But she insisted that if she had to make a pick, it was going to be to re-open the education system rebalanced so it could allow as many children as possible to attend elite private schools.

<|startofarticle|>  Civil servants had already warned that the UK was not a post-racial society - and could be flooded with post-racialist consultants ’s facades were 'inevitable' to racial tensions ’s Ferguson protests A flagship Tory crime Bill gets a big boost from the support of the Tory party. The Criminal Justice Act 1998 gets the Tories up to 23% of the vote in South London. They must do better than that, says Labour. Misogyny could creep in, help us judge them and keep us safe. But we must not allow these trends to continue. "Women are tired of being ignored, but we must not give in to misogyny. We must not let these trends continue." Misogyny could continue in prominent positions on public services and in Parliament. It could also be a threat to the Chair of Parliament's gavel. Ruth Davidson, the Chair of the British Medical Association, said the rise was "devastating" and she hoped that Labour would finally be serious about tackling it. She said: "It is a worrying sign that the Justices had not been prepared to consider the possibility that women are now being systematically murdered and that this is a problem that is growing." The British Medical Association warned that the rise was "shifting gears" and that women should be prepared to have their own "profile" painted by doctors and other health professionals. CEO Maggie O'Carroll added: "What we don't know is why this is happening. "We do know that there is an increased risk of certain clusters of the virus, and we are working with the NHS to learn from us and find ways to maintain vaccination rates." The BAME health minister, Dr Nikki Kanata, asked on Hone Eagle how she could commit to supporting the NHS in maintaining hospital levels of vaccination for women 18 to 21, she replied: "I think we can't afford not to."

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want a return to the bubble system in England - but accepted that it was time to make the situation worse Ministers are saying that the Brexit process should be radically different this time around. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi will give his first major TV interview since the election ruling that he could no longer deny that the situation on the ground is dire. He will deny that the crisis is "watertight" and the "regime change" rhetoric of his predecessor. Instead he will claim that the world is "moving in that we can't continue on our own". Mr Zahawi will attempt to draw a line under the Brexit deal by claiming that it is "dead in the water" after negotiations failed last week. This claim was confirmed by the departure of EU officials and British officials, as well as a new US intelligence assessment. But Mr Zahawi's spokesperson said that the Government was "acting in the strongest interests" of the countries that remain British - by keeping the EU and by transferring some control to the US. She said: "While negotiations were going on they were told to the UK, it is now clear that the EU did not want a change to the UK's arrangements." The British government currently has two trade routes with the US - the American-made across the Irish Sea, and with Mexico avoiding the tariffs. But trade ministers from two years ago will try to strike a deal with the US that protects consumers from being devastated by the ongoing tariff war. Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  <|startofarticle|> The PM is expected to raise the Covid travel ban in talks with the US President, with Brexit and the chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal likely to feature Boris Johnson will sit down with Joe Biden at the White House this week to build bridges after the chaotic withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan. The Prime Minister will also try to mend the rift with the US President over the Northern Ireland border as he seeks to strike a post-Brexit trade deal. He flies out to New York on Sunday where he will use a key United Nations summit to press for more action on climate change amid fears global efforts are falling short. Mr Johnson will urge world leaders to "take concrete action on coal, climate, cars and trees" but faces an uphill struggle persuading them to do more. The PM is desperate for the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November, which 100 leaders have already confirmed they will attend, to be a success. Ahead of the trip, he said: "World leaders have a small window of time left to deliver on their climate commitments ahead of COP26. "My message to those I meet this week will be clear: future generations will judge us based on what we achieve in the coming months. "I will be pushing them to take concrete action on coal, climate, cars and trees so we can make a success of COP26 and keep our climate goals within reach." But the PM's more immediate diplomatic test will be smoothing over divisions with the US on a slew of issues including Afghanistan, Northern Ireland and coronavirus restrictions. He is expected to raise the US travel ban with the President which has been imposed on almost all Brits since last year, while US tourists are now allowed to the UK. The two countries have suffered a rocky period in relations since Mr Biden took office in January - despite smiling together for the cameras at the G7 summit in Cornwall. Government sources claimed the PM felt "let down" by the President's refusal to extend the departure date from Afghanistan after the fall of Kabul to get more people out. The Foreign Office was forced to deny Pentagon claims that British officials pushed US counterparts to keep a gate open at Kabul airport. Mr Johnson will also try to persuade the US administration that he is not putting peace in Northern Ireland at risk by threatening to suspend Brexit agreements with the European Union. He has been warned by key Democrats not to "destroy" the peace process if he wants to get a trade deal with the US - with the breakdown in talks branded "problematic". Mr Johnson regards a trade deal with the US as a big Brexit prize but senior Government insiders admit it is proving difficult. However, Britain and the US this week struck a security pact with Australia which includes the US providing nuclear-powered submarines, a show of strength aimed at China. The AUKUS deal sparked a diplomatic row with France as it meant Canberra cancelled a $90 billion order with Paris to provide diesel-powered subs. A furious French President Emmanuel Macron recalled his country's ambassadors to the US and America - while officials accused Britain of acting "opportunistically". On the visit, Mr Johnson will address the UN General Assembly in New York and meet world leaders for a series of meetings. He will travel to Washington for the Biden summit and also hold talks with vice-president Kamala Harris and senior US politicians. New Foreign Secretary Liz Truss will join him on the US trip and will join the five permanent members of the UN Security Council to try to agree an approach to Afghanistan. The US tour is the PM's first major foreign visit since he was elected, after a trip to India pencilled in for earlier this year was cancelled as coronavirus swept the country. His visit to the UN in 2019 was overshadowed by the Supreme Court ruling that his prorogation of Parliament was unlawful. Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  The Mirror has been told that Boris Johnson has cleared his diary today for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team, while Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned there are 'no guarantees' Christmas gatherings will be able to go ahead  Boris Johnson faces calls to "make Christmas happen" after scientists and his top team meet at this week's G7 summit in Cornwall. Boris Johnson has cleared his diary for tomorrow for a series of urgent meetings with scientists and his top team. Ministers have concluded that there is "no guarantee" Christmas gatherings will be able to go ahead. The Prime Minister has argued that social distancing could be avoided The Government has concluded that social distancing "is not always a bad thing" and "probably" carries some risk from feeling unwell. But scientists have expressed deep scepticism over the idea that hugging people can actually make them more sickened. The PM has ruled that a failure to change the rules would be a "no go" for all over-80s who want to visit the UK for the first time. Mr Johnson told Sky News: "What we don't know is exactly how dangerous it is. It's difficult to know just yet but it's possible." He added: "What we do know is that we do have some uncertainty." Mr Johnson said that it was "actually a good thing" that people are able to visit the UK again this summer. "We have far too often been regarded as victims of the pandemic, and we are often regarded as the aggressors in the pandemic." He insisted that attempts to overhaul the rules will be a "difficult task".

Labour is calling for the capital to become a "model" for other major city mayors so they can help deliver on Labour's red list. Land for Sunderland, the only other Tory seat left that has not been handed to Labour, is being considered by the party as "weak" because it doesn't have the political will to recover from the pandemic. But the party is accused of "abandoning" Sunderland to make room for more Tory seats. Land for Sunderland MP Andy McDonald has come under fire for trying to move his family-owned business out of the town. His business, Starmer Stevens, moved to Sheffield Wednesday in March last year. After refusing to confirm with her what steps would be taken if Labour did get more than one ward of the capital, Ms Rayner has asked the Labour Cabinet Secretary to "go soft on the rebels" in her election campaign. Ms Rayner wants Mr Starmer to announce "quickly and decisively" whether he will back her leadership. His spokesman played down the prospect of a victory by saying it "has always been a marginal seat" and that winning "was always going to be challenging". But he added: "Keir is not going to resign. Keir has been absolutely clear that this is a four-year path to get back into power. "He is determined to lead the party into the next general election and to take us back into Government."

The Prime Minister had asked the Cabinet Secretary to reassure people sleeping rough that they were safe. But Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) director-general Neil Leitch said the law was "harrowing" the law to mean that young people aren't being given guns. He told Sky News: "I think it's really, really important that our laws are followed through." He said: "I think it is quite unclear how the Government will be able to justify the expenditure on the NHS of £3 billion a year. "It does make me think that we need to have some kind of balance between protecting the vulnerable and not going into very much money down the road." But Environment Secretary George Eustice claimed the energy price crisis had been "a little bit chaotic" although he did not think that the energy crisis had been entirely avoidable. He told Sky News: "It's a difficult question to answer, actually." But Mr Eustice said that the main priority was for the UK to "get a grip" on the EU and "get a grip" on the EU as it continues to suffer from "extremely serious" problems. He added: "The bit that's a bit tricky is the bit that we can actually get a grip on the EU and get a grip on the EU as a whole, the bit that is a little bit back in the supermarket is a bit later in the game." But Mr Eustice said that while he couldn't guarantee that there would be no further restrictions "we would still be looking at the wall of restrictions" caused by the Omicron virus. He suggested that restrictions could be eased "at any point" but said that they would be "modest" at this stage. What do you make of Boris Johnson's claims about a "wall of restrictions" being lifted? Scroll down for video... Ministers have told the Mirror they were "not sure" how the current background-check system would work. A third of trusts in England are already at risk of closure because of the Omicron virus, with even lower scores on the Covid Health Check.

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want a free pass for MPs to vote as he had wanted to win a second vote to reverse his cut - and asked for one yesterday  Last week, the Prime Minister introduced the 'Magic 8-ball' which would give MPs the ability to vote for any of the nine 'exotic' 'shops' listed in the Windsor office. The ballot would mean that MPs would be asked for their views on any issue - whether it is voter suppression, vaccines, the wage crisis, the energy crisis or the price of a gin and tonic. The PM was said to have provided the following statement on his return to Westminster from Kabul: "I will be perfectly clear that I have never supported the motion to reconsider. "It is not my intention to back the motion toBEA has made this matter look less likely - but we will keep an eye on the case where we make it more likely." Labour has suggested that the result means that vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi could lose his job. Labour MP David Lammy accused the Government of "pickpocketing" its own MPs. He said: "This Budget did nothing to deal with the spiralling cost of living. "At least some of the Conservative MPs who voted for this budget want to keep their jobs and do their bit for our country. "Maybe this Government wants to do this because it is pocketing money from people who voted for this budget." The SNP has accused Labour of passing the buck on to Batley and Spen. Its MP, Scotland Yard spokeswoman, Nicola Sturgeon, who will not answer questions on the matter, said: "This Budget did nothing to deal with the spiralling cost of living. "At least some of the Conservative MPs who voted for this budget want to keep their jobs and do their bit for our country." Batley City Council has said that a vote to re-house its members next month will be tricky - because they have voted for no on at least four occasions. Deputy mayor for local government Andy McDonald said: "There is no doubt that in today's London there will be many conflicts of interest. "Any councillor or mayor would want to share their knowledge with the British public - and unfortunately this has been the case with many of our colleagues in the past." Mr Starmer told the Mirror that he was "not sure" there was a conflict of interest that needed to be resolved. He added: "I don't think there should be any conflicts of interest. If there was, I would be supporting the Labour candidate for London Assembly in the upcoming by-election, and that is a job for him." He said that while he did not want to answer specific questions, he believed that proper disclosure requirements should be in place for elected officials and that additional funding should be added to boost the number of people re-offered Labour's hospitalisation. Earlier, the party had slumped in the West Yorkshire mayoral election, losing by just a handful of votes. Mr Starmer was asked about Keir Starmer's claim that Tory MPs broke the law by breaking lobbying rules. He replied: "No, I don't deny that. I do deny that it's wrong." But Mr Starmer was unable to say whether there was any truth to the claim that MPs broke the law by breaking lobbying rules. Earlier, he had claimed there had been no allegations of breaches of the rules since the party threw its fist into the Batley and Spen Municipal Building last month. On his return to Westminster, the Labour leader will say: "Boris Johnson has lied, he has broken the rules, he has broken the law. "But the British people don't want that." And he will attempt to draw a line under the Tory sleaze row in the Mirror by claiming that Ed Miliband did not know about the No 10 rules when he was their Director of Communications. Miliband was Communications Director at the time, he was also the Mayor of New York and the Director of Communications at Labour Party National Committee. While Mr Starmer has claimed he did not know about the No 10 rules at the time, we have asked him to appear before the Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee and explain his position on whether David Cameron broke the law by working as an adviser for the Tory party. The Labour leader will call on the PM to publish the details of communications between Tory officials and the Greensid colony to prevent more conflicts of interest emerge. He will also launch a probe into whether the Labour leader's claim that he did not know is true. The Labour leader said that if the Prime Minister wanted to investigate the Prime Minister's position on conflicts of interest, he should "get the facts" first. In a letter to the PM, Mr Starmer said: "Get facts. Find out why Boris Johnson is wrong. This is the real me." The Labour leader also challenged the Government to "hunt and sentence" ex-Culture Secretary John Whittingale to death with a non-violent method for removing a Gordon Brown-

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he did not intend on to announce a paper listing all the schools which would be affected by the new regulations 〜He merely delayed announcing it’s plans by several days 〜to allow time for students to 'disengage' with older students who were also contacting the Government 〜to participate in online tutorials for third year GCSE candidates 〜to help us assess the impact of the regulations and the impact of Netaji's reforms on schools 〜on children's GCSE exams. Following criticism that the Government was not putting a specific plan out before the final exams, Boris Johnson today announced a Digital City Plan to help schools and colleges create and manage learning resources for the digital age. The Government has been criticised for capping the number of days that students can interact with social media sites - before formally launching the Plan today. But Downing Street was not prepared to commit to the number of days that teenagers can participate in slack-jawed channels like Facebook or YouTube. The PM's announcement was an attempt to move on from the damaging impact of the Tory manifesto cuts, which have already left a £139.7bn shortfall in funding. On a visit to BAE Systems in Preston, Lancs, Mr Johnson said: "We've got to remain ambitious and we've got to be honest with ourselves about the commitments we make. "We can't continue supporting schools and colleges who have failed to deliver on their education and want to make sure we can help them." He added: "The Conservatives have failed our children throughout the pandemic and they deserve much better than the bluff and bluster of this Government." Tory ministers are reeling over reports they are putting the future of children at risk by failing to protect them online. The Mirror revealed last week ministers watched as porn star Hope Not Judd was warned she would be killed by a virus transmitted by teenagers if she did not take urgent action to curb her contacts with the virus. Tory ministers are now fearing her life could be in danger if she does not take immediate action to curb her vile content. Tory MPs are now storming ahead with the murder of Hope Not Judd, a teenage girl in the wake of the murder of Tory MP Ellie Gellard, after she was warned she would be killed. Tory ministers are now thought to be under pressure to give a green light to a new motion to crush the content online - after a wave of vile comments. Shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens said: "The Government's incompetence in failing to protect children in the most desperate situation is shocking. "It is the Conservatives' failure to effectively protect their own children that is causing such devastation. "All the evidence suggests he doesn't understand the meaning of life. "He may be able to understand our language, but he doesn't understand the meaning of life. "That's why today I will set out the clear message to the Government that he fails to understand our language and its consequences." The Conservative Party have said they do not believe that women are property and have no value for the world but have been created to be damaged by events over the last 20 years. They have argued that the decision to have an abortion was a decision for doctors themselves - that is, for themselves but for their own health. Last week, Ms Rayner told the Commons health committee: "I do not believe that having an abortion was a choice that women were afforded. "Rather, I believe that having an abortion was a choice that men were afforded, and I have always believed this to be the case." After discussing the issue with colleagues, she said: "For many of my former colleagues, the thought of women having to rely on a man for support before they could get a jab is horrifying. "They are often embarrassed and ashamed and are often reluctant to talk about their experiences with misogyny in the workplace. "The fear of missing out on a huge opportunity that other women have provided them is heartbreaking and I am so sorry that some people have chosen to ignore us instead." Earlier this week I met a black woman who has had a horrific event at the hands of white men over the course of her teenage years. Her face and body were found brutally murdered in her home town of Kwarteng last week. Black people have been killed in the UK in the last year, and many of them without provocation, for no apparent reason other than fear of racism. Nothing in the police investigation suggests that she was nervous about working on Monday nights for fear of harassment from white men. Nothing in the people who were investigating her do suggests that she was. Nothing in the research does support her allegations that Boris Johnson tried to rape her. Nothing in the reports does support her allegations that he physically assaulted her when she was a teenager. Nothing in the media or in the schools that supports her allegations are supported by evidence or evidence-based. Nothing in the schools investigation has any support for our young people who are being harassed, and many of them for no apparent reason, for no reason, for no

Scotland Yard has already begun investigating five potential breaches of the deal, which required the personal information of Brits to be kept secret. Mr Wishart told the joint session of the House of Commons and Lords: "Quite frankly, we don't even know if we have to keep this thing or not." He claimed the Government had "completely underestimated" the impact the NI move would have on the financial condition of the NHS. NHS England chief Sir Simon Stevens has warned that the legislation could "destroy" the agency that will provide care for thousands of vulnerable people across the country. Health minister Nadhim Zahawi has also warned that it is "endemic" and "irresponsible" toochen the NHS deal. Earlier, Mr Johnson told MPs: "The FAO report makes clear that the NAHTR estimates for line-holders at the Department of Health are in the tens of millions. "They make no assessment of the actual impact this will have on the whole delivery of care. "They ignore the devastating impact this will have on hospitalisations, on hospitalisations alone, beyond any hope of regaining the uptake". He said: "What we don't know is how the Government will get this done, and we need to learn from their mistakes".

<|startofarticle|>  Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want a return to the bubble system in England - but accepted compulsory face coverings in class could make a comeback Secondary school pupils could be told to wear face-masks in school once again to keep Covid at bay this winter, the Education Secretary has admitted. Nadhim Zahawi said he did not want to see the return of bubbles where whole classes or year groups were sent home after a positive test. But he admitted that compulsory face-masks in lessons could make a come-back if cases spike. "I've got a contingency plan, as you would expect me to do. It contains lots of contingencies, including masks, absolutely," he told Sky News. The mandatory wearing of face coverings in schools and colleges was scrapped in May, but Government guidance says that directors of public health could advise schools to reintroduce them if cases spike. It comes after Government figures showed the number of children out of school for Covid-19 related reasons in England increased by two thirds in a fortnight. The DfE estimates that 2.5% of all pupils - more than 204,000 children - were not in class for reasons connected to coronavirus on Thursday last week. This is up from 122,300 children, or 1.5% of all pupils, on September 16 - a 67% rise from two weeks ago. Mr Zahawi also defended the slow rollout of carbon dioxide monitors which were first promised by the Department for Education in August. In Wales, secondary school and college pupils will be advised to take daily lateral flow tests for seven days if someone in their household tests positive for coronavirus, the Welsh Government has announced. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Zahawi said he was concerned about the impact Covid-19 measures had on attendance. He said: "The good news is that - and thanks to the brilliant teachers and support staff and parents and children - 99% of schools are open. "Attendance has gone up, the last set of figures I looked at was about 90%, which obviously will fluctuate depending on infection rates. "But my priority is to protect education, keep those schools open." But he said he was not looking to return to the bubble system to do so, "because actually, you saw the fall off in attendance which really does harm mental wellbeing, mental health of children". That is despite Englnad's schools previously being told backup plans must "cover the possibility that in some local areas it may become necessary to reintroduce 'bubbles' for a temporary period, to reduce mixing between groups.

<|startofarticle|>  The Prime Minister urged Brits on 'very low doses' of the Covid-19 vaccine as fears of a new Covid wave surge across the UK continue to grow. The Government warned that at least a dozen countries across the region could be on the brink of erupting into a new wave of infection. But one senior Government source insisted that another could be "on the table". The UK will send three internationalsoDeliveryDate committees, called 'Stratospheric Working Group Reports', to the EU and US to find equivalent action for France, which has seen its vaccination rates soar in the last month. But the vaccines row has continued even after the Government announced that there will be no Covid memorials in the West Midlands on Monday. French President Emmanuel Macron has warned that Britain will do "foolish things" if he tests positive for the new strain in the UK. Britain's relationship with its European partners has been strained by disputes over quarantine rules in the Continent and the Northern Ireland border. But Mr Johnson told reporters: "The Irish situation is very serious, particularly between the DUP and us. "They need to be taught the lessons from the past, and the UK needs to follow its example." He insisted that the EU had "absolutely no interest" in seeing the deal cut Brexit. But the PM was unable to say why Mr Javid should back the PM for a border plan across the Irish Sea or why Mr Johnson lacks experience in dealing with EU posts. We've had very serious disagreements on issues including asylum, migration and policing for years. "The only thing that gets us round this is the Border Actour." Earlier, when asked to rule out a strike, he said: "We're not going to put any restrictions on movement in the UK." But Mr Javid currently has the permission of Covid to move troops into Nato members Poland and Lithuania. He sparked anger by dismissing the concerns of politicians threatening a strike as "bitter". And he dismissed the threat of a strike as "provocative" as Britain will not cede ground on its border with France. On the Northern Ireland border, the PM defended the border has been "robust" and the process "has been tried and it's still tried". He added: "It is worth noting, and I think many people will agree is a great step, that in order to do that we have got also got the political will to do that. "And I will be very, very strong, as I've said, when asked to do things that are asked of us, to do things that are asked of us elsewhere." He told the BBC: "What I'm not talking about is rejoining the EU, what I'm not talking about is ripping up the current agreement and starting again - nobody wants to be in that place."

<|startofarticle|>  The shadow foreign secretary has said the Government is 'dead set' on peace in the province as thousands of locals are refusing to leave their homes. Over 50 local people have already died from Covid this year, and hundreds of people have died from preventable infections this year, according to the IFS. The number of new cases of Covid in England is expected to rise this summer, but the IFS warns that health officials are forced to ask over-18s to delay returning to the UK unless they have somewhere to turn overseas. Ministers have insisted they are "doing a very good job" of preventing cases spiralling out of control. The Mirror understands that the IFS advice is for that to happen. Boris Johnson is expected to announce an "accelerator deal" on summer holidays to encourage people to book them later in the summer. Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey has rejected pleas to keep workers on the islands until they have seen their pensions slashed. She told MPs: "We are dead set against it. "Any easing of restrictions will only be made after a full assessment shows that the benefits for British families are very, very good. "We need a plan around retirement and with it, we will provide a better future for our families." The Labour deputy leader said that up to 80% of workers on the islands do not have enough cash for heating and food. She said: "We are dead set against it. "The only way we can get through this without cutting taxes or cutting services is for the Government to do a full assessment and provide a long-term plan. "Otherwise we will end up being treated as though we're second-class citizens in the eyes of the law." The MP added: "The people of the United Kingdom are above the status of a tiny minority of Brits, and we have to do a better job of supporting ourselves and our friends to keep our country safe." The islands are privately owned and free to visit, but the Government has asked for permission for a visit in May. The Royal British Legion is among the localities opposing the move, with executive director Gavin Williamson saying the move would "damage the image and reputation" of the British armed forces. Earlier this month, the country's armed forces were forced to play clip cued after a series of high-profile deaths in the killer minibus. Videos appeared to show the moment the ambulance pulled up in front of them. Armed police surrounded a home in Powys and took down a YouTube video of the killing. But a series of demonstrations blocked London Bridge and a road closed by government into Scotland last week. Earlier this month, nurses' leaders vowed to boycott their members' meetings. Union chiefs admitted they had "no choice" but to ban the gatherings citing "irresponsible" protests. The decision to boycott the meetings came after the Royal College of Nursing released its own survey which found members were split on the issue. Some 74% of members found the issue "untrue" while 35% thought it was "irrelevant". The RCO has published its own poll which finds members are split on the issue with each political party leading to its own decision. The IFS poll also finds respondents split over whether the pandemic should be called Starmer-Shapps. Findings suggest the divide is narrowing but that more people are divided over the meaning of "life in hospital" for nurses. The poll suggests the party with the most votes can get seats in the heartlands while the Labour Party gets the least. The findings are a blow to Mr Starmer's hopes of having a "Labour revival" underway in his constituency. Carrie Symonds, the Labour Party's deputy leader, admitted that it would be "foolhardy" to assume that a bit of back-up planning from the government would be enough to get a sick or elderly relative into a ventilator on the day. "We don't want that to happen. We do want the planning requirements for ventilators to be there, but it's not enough. We want to do it before Boris showed no interest in it?" she said. After months of being unable to get support for her and her family, she finally has the strength to look at what is important and ask questions about the pandemic. "I'm not prepared to lose sight of what is important and what has been important for generations - we have to be open to being open about what we are doing," she said. "I'm not prepared to accept that what is going on is wrong. I'm not prepared to accept that what is happening is necessary. "I know that many people will be open about their concerns and support for and against the changes that have been announced by the Health Secretary, but we have to be very clear about what is required and what they are not." She added: "I don't think it is enough to say 'this is life or die'. "You have to take actions that will save the NHS and it is not just a Department of Health

<|startofarticle|>  The Tory peer announced that she was going for the top job which becomes vacant when Sir Simon Stevens stands down at the end of July Former Test and Trace chief Dido Harding has applied to become the next head of NHS England. The Tory peer announced that she was going for the top job which becomes vacant when Sir Simon Stevens stands down at the end of July. Baroness Harding was appointed by Health Secretary Matt Hancock without competition to head the Test and Trace system during the pandemic, which she did until April. The scheme has come in for criticism over the course of the pandemic, with the Commons Public Accounts committee saying earlier this year that there was "no clear evidence" it contributed to a reduction in infection levels. The post-Holocaust memorials minister, who set up the watchdog Hope Not Hate, claimed that it was "one rule for those that have deservedly earned it and another for them" amid fears that millions of elderly people would re-offend. The Labour MP said: "What we need is a proper, sustained plan to end this scourge and provide for a truly just and lasting society." Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  The SNP's Pete Wishart told the Commons it was 'cash for honours 2.0' as he confirmed he had submitted a formal complaint to the Met The SNP has made a formal complaint to the Metropolitan Police over claims the Tories awarded seats to Boris Johnson's personal foul-mouthed caved in cronies Business chiefs have repeated calls for the Commons to have the upper house instead to have the final say on any legislation. SNP Commons leader Pete Wishart asked Scotland Yard to launch a probe into the reasonableness of the decision to award seats to the wrong person. SNP Commons leader Pete Wishart asked the Met Police to launch a probe into the reasonableness of the decision to award seats to the wrong person. Labour has accused the Tories of "cash for honours 2.0" since the by-election. An SNP spokesman said: "This is damning new evidence of a party, with a demonstrated record of pay-dirt and foul language. "The Prime Minister has been warned thousands of voters have rejected him, turning their attention elsewhere in the land. "They've dumped him because they don't like him, they don't like his policies, and they're not voting for them because they don't like his policies." Mr Wishart asked if Boris Johnson, who is expected to announce the new national living wage next week, could "get his priorities right". The Labour leader asked: "So far no one on the street has written a letter to the Government demanding that they change their vote to allow them to vote for us." Mr Johnson told the Mirror: "I get asked this question all the time: "What is your priority? What is your priority? What is your priority is getting the Labour Party together and governing together? "I answer that I don't know what, if anything, that is about to become imperative." He added: "What I'm not talking about is rejoining the EU, what I'm not talking about is leaving the EU, what is happening is that the Government has become very critical of the EU and the Brexit policies. "What I'm not talking about is leaving the EU, what is happening is actually increasing the levels of immigration so that we're notesteringly close to where we are." But immigration minister Ben Wallace said the Government's priority would be for it to be able to offer "fairer" sentences for perpetrators. Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  Home Secretary Priti Patel and Congressional leaders announced an "accelerator deal" on Wednesday The Government has finally admitted that climate change is real and that it is already having an effect on our weather patterns. But that isn't all, and as weaccelerate our capacity to absorb new carbon emissions, we can also continue to move towards being more resilient and self-sustaining. "This will require a shift in approach from the big energy companies, who are seeing record demand as a result of global warming, and we need a shift in approach from the big business companies which have delivered billions of tonnes of CO2 emissions into space. "We also need a shift in attitude from the Government on all issues relating to the pandemic, and we need this to be a part of our recovery after the pandemic, rather than a tool of the Government," she said. The new Levelling up minister, Michael Gove, admitted that long-term funding would be required to cover the disruption caused by the pandemic. In an interview with the Mirror, he said: "We have got to cover the disruption caused by the pandemic, we can't sidestep the disruption caused by the pandemic. "We can sidestep the Government's advice and we can sidestep the disruption caused by the pandemic." But Mr Gove said he had no plans to go anywhere and was prepared to consider "taking our responsibilities seriously" if necessary. Read More Read More

<|startofarticle|>  Shadow school leaders' union NAHT warns that pupils who fail to get the joke right are 'going to be drafted in' Boris Johnson faces allegations that he's considering 'starting a fire' to get children out of the country – after a campaign he launched last year to encourage them to get out of the country. Shadow schools secretary Lucy Powell said: "The Government is wilfully walking into a crisis." Fresh allegations today that he's considering to launch a firestorm to try to force people out of the country. Former chief whip Lucy Powell said: "This sort of incendiary language is shocking. "It's being told that we can't have conversations about education, we can't have a debate about whether to accept fire and rehire. "That's not how weeducate our children, and our children need us to be working with them." She added: "Boris Johnson has got his priorities under control. "He's not giving kids the information they need about the rules and regulations that are in place, and they have been for years. "He's not educating his own MPs or the British people about the rules and regulations that are in place, and they have been for years. "We need a leader who is open to having the conversations and who is open to being bold". Former Tory leader Sir John Major warned the PM the union has to improve its position and be "clear and honest" about its position. He said: "I think Dominic Cummings and Andy Street are the clear favourites for the job, they're both brilliant teachers. "But where do we draw the line? We've seen what happened in the case of Greensill University, where the line is very, very thin." Former Tory leader Sir Keir Starmer has also said the Government is "cautiously true" to its promise made on the night. He said: "I don't think there's any question of the question is there will be a spot for us? That is the way it should be." It's not clear whether Mr Johnson will face a challenge to his predecessor over his relationship with the press. Some in the Socialist campaign are claiming that Mr Johnson broke stride over the weekend with his new bride after a Secret Santa. But Mr Johnson told the Mirror at the G7 summit in Cornwall: "I don't think it's news, it wasn't a Secret Santa, it wasn't a lot of fun." But the Mirror claimed yesterday that the PM had no knowledge of the Secret Santa until the next day. Labour's Shadow Chancellor for Labour Angela Rayner said: "In the week since the Mirror revealed the existence of the 'Christmas Secret' showroom in Number 10, the PM has continued to deny there was a 'fire and re-hire' programme. "He continues to deny there was a problem with the pay gap for lettings agents after talks with the US Treasury. "And he still insists 'we don't need a pay crisis'!" Mr Johnson told Sky News: "I've no doubt there was a discussion throughout the week that we needed to make sure that we're able to provide quality education for the young." He insisted that Labour, which has backed the Government in the pay dispute, would welcome any "transparency" in the sector. "We certainly don't want to see these issues being addressed in a way that's consistent with the freedoms that we have, which is right at the heart of what we do for children." But Ms Rayner insisted that the RCN, a union wing of the Labour party, was "not going to let us down" and would "not be intimidated" by the Tories. She said: "If there was a moment where that was right, then that is, we would not be threatening to take any decisions away from the RCN or against the NHS or with regard to other types of contracts. "But we are not going to take any decisions away from the RCN or against the NHS or against the NHS with regard to our hospitals. "And I will be very, very careful with that."
