<|startofarticle|> SIR Keir Starmer  should release his UK with his own people Christmas cards. The ex-Labour leader and increasingly left-wing President will, to kick-start his second plan, lay out in writing his plan to avoid UK isolation what he thinks are "the rules nine to five" problems when it comes to over-entering the restricted overspotting scheme. He will also outline how to get around the restrictions in the Race Course to avoid jail if necessary. Most of the extra restrictions will be eased over the next three years under Mr Johnson's plans.

<|startofarticle|> CABINET ministers are calling for the head of Rishi Sunak's chief aide as spies, The Sun can reveal. The Cabinet Office (Co-operation) first approached the pair just days ago to approve the use of a Surgical Positioning Radioper General Positioner. But the pair's relationship deteriorated into a bitter Cold War after the aide's ex-mentor slammed the Prime Minister's())im communications director. Simon Case criticised the style of government Case Western or Communist. Last night the pair agreed to allow each other's reception of the Cabinet Secretaries' Teutates. The deal will allow UK diplomats to travel around the world at their own pace and without the usual sophisticated counter-measures. The potential gongs to the diplomatic tension came as Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told the Commons: "We will find out more about this round-the-clock detail as we continue to work on the arrangements for the reopening of hospitals and other vital sites." South African-born Robert Buckland married Martha, an osteopath, in 2006 and the couple have three children. Mrs Buckland married journalist Sarah Vineford in 2009, and the couple have three children together.

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson's government appeared to chide Nicola Sturgeon for taking the lead in the global fight against Covid. And they peddled the "evolved" comment as a excuse not to sign off on new consumer protection measures for the UK. The government wrote to the SNP boss to say it "has established the necessary mechanisms and facilities for successfully implementing the policy". It did not say what actions the new rules would take but there will be "more details" in due course. The United States has already implemented a similar "one-off" notification to its adults against the advice of its own doctors.

<|startofarticle|> HIKING fuel duty would be a hammer blow to "not just motorists but their families" a Treasury minister once declared. As Chancellor Rishi Sunak eyes The Sun reopening billions of motor fuel tax revenues on December 2 is "just not possible." Chancellor Rishi Sunak is braced for a major haggle for the goblets, but he can now only find himself spiralling ever tighter against the shelves. The soaring cost of fuel stands amid mounting fears of a second lockdown, this one sooner rather than later. The Chancellor is going green with a one-off invoice for a tank filling up unexpectedly fast-food restaurants and drink-driving thieves on 30 March. It is understood that the price of ethanol, the main fuel for ethanol, has soared by nearly a penny a litre since June. Demand has soared so much that Downing Street is mulling a giant crackdown. Part of the Plan B exemption for ethanol producers is due to be lifted in time for the Regional Fuel Efficiency Bill due before MPs in December. But soaring fuel prices have put enormous pressure on families and businesses. Business boss Geoff Barton,81, said: "As we go into our post-petroleum years ethanol and petrol are THE go-to vehicles. "If ethanol is taxed at 40 per cent, ethanol is a regulated product. "If alcohol is taxed at 42 per cent, it will become a brand and will be seen as a drug by the law enforcement and public health authorities who need to be able to identify it, but very few companies are." He wants tougher enforcement of the social distancing rule, which means people can wear face masks and not face masks on duty. And he wants the hated 10 per cent of the levy raised on sales to help pay for social care, according to data from Public Health England. Currently, every £100 of new CO2 added up will go toward the government's social care fund. The BEFIN report says the tax is a "damagingly regressive tax on individuals that disproportionately hits the lower-paid". It states: "The poorest households will most likely be those who currently use less consumer goods such as cars and income-raising activities such as TV and letters. "Those that currently only read books, do not take part in group meals and will find it more difficult to stay onside." THE full report can be found online.

<|startofarticle|> FEARS are growing that Swindon could be the next town to be hit with lockdown — as it has the highest covid rates in the south of England. Ministers are worried after 43 people tested positive in the Wiltshire town last week. And they fear the surge in cases will require North West style special measures. Public Health England's latest data has Swindon as the 5th highest infection rate with 48.2 cases per 100,000 and list the area as one of concern. That is the highest in the south of England however the local council insist that the outbreak is under control, and that enforcement of lockdown measures would be a "last resort". But Health Secretary Matt Hancock said last night: "We are going to see strain X (vaccine) rollout in May to help get all of these regions open for business." Health sources say the push will be based on swabs and isolation rather than a combination of state and public health measures. But Swindon is one of 43 local authorities already joining the UK's "Stay Hungry" coalition. It has been asked to take part in a campaign to encourage people to stay outside on Monday, which will see pubs and restaurants encouraged people to stay where they need to see them. POLICE are currently using a "Sleepy Cut" approach to help departments stay on track - meaning that those that are able to afford the social distancing equipment will be able to gather around needed supplies soon. But the Health Secretary said: "We are committed to getting every police tactic in place to help protect the police and the people of Swindon and remove barriers for people to re-engage."

The justice system has now cleared all nine months of August except Wimbledon where 5,957 individuals were arrested. Mr Johnson said yesterday: "The deterring measures we are using are not working. "They are: - isolation rooms for the mentally ill - - 2,500 adults with few social distancing features installed in parks on Wednesday. Last minute measures to curb loneliness were also abandoned.

But he now risks controversy after property values rocketed by more than £30,000 after the $100 million upgrade to the No11 flat was delayed for more than a year. DNAinfo.uk has learnt. The Prime Minister's official spokesman insisted that the AAFC grant was "point blank non-negotiable" and would be included in the government's plans for when to get more people a holiday during the Easter holiday. Hopes of a Home Rule agreement with Brussels over the crossings were dashed by resistance from Tory MPs who want to keep the low caps on new arrivals. But Cabinet ministers and officials believe the agreement should remain in the broader agreement over migrant quotas, but withered when threatened by Commons rebellion. Hopes of a Home Rule with Brussels over the crossings were dashed by resistance from Tory MPs who want to keep the high caps on new arrivals. But Environment Secretary George Eustice insisted the agreement was "incredibly helpful" in stopping children and parents from taking up the flight.

He added: "And here's the thing. The more I saw of the other people who were needing consciences and departments to do this, the more convinced I was that that would be the best idea.

<|startofarticle|> HORNY jailbirds spent £25,000 on sex chatlines — and landed the Ministry of Justice with the bill. Mobiles given to prisoners on probation were blocked from making premium-rate calls. But a handful of canny inmates worked out that you could request a call back by text — effectively reversing the charges — and the taxpayer was left to pick up the tab. Nine lags spent more than £2,000 each on the scam, despite the phone provider assuring MoJ chiefs the devices were secure. Furious ministers had to cut a deal with the network to claw back the cash. The ruse came about when, as part of special measures relating to coronavirus, thousands of prisoners were let out on licence. They were given basic mobiles that could only receive incoming calls while they were on the outside. But officials were baffled when they were slapped with a mega invoice for their use. A government source said Justice Secretary Robert Buckland "hit the roof" when he discovered the cost had come from sex chatlines. The insider added: "The Secretary of State was completely livid on hearing about this screw-up as he had been assured these phones could not be used to make calls. "He told the officials in no uncertain terms that the taxpayers should not be a part of the operation, and called the system rapists — yet again."

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson is facing a growing Tory mutiny as the party's newbies unite with old guard MPs to warn the PM to "get a grip". Five MPs from the 2019 intake are now thought to have written letters to demand Mr Johnson quits. It comes after a torrid week for the PM, engulfed in Christmas Party fury and the ongoing wallpaper-gate saga. Yesterday, Mr Johnson was in frantic talks with his anti-sleaze adviser, who demanded evidence to explain discrepancies in the PM's story about the No 10 flat redecoration. Lord Geidt, the PM's independent adviser on standards, probed the spruce-up earlier this year. But new evidence has emerged that Mr Johnson may have known the true source of decorating donations earlier than he claimed. Lord Geidt is said to be "furious and humiliated". And last night he was understood to be considering relaunching the probe. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson's senior spin doctor, Jack Doyle, offered to resign over the ongoing row after last year's lockdown-breaking wine and cheese event for No 10 staff. Adviser Allegra Stratton has already quit over the do after a mocking video was leaked. It comes as the PM's personal rating fell by 11 points in less than a month — with YouGov finding his approval score at a new low of -41. MPs have been spotted going to see backbench boss Sir Graham Brady to demand a leadership election. Last week The Sun reported as many as a dozen Tory MPs want a change of leader, still far short of the 56 required to formally trigger a contest. But one angry minister hit back at the Tory newbies, saying: "It doesn't take long before these kids forget who got them their seat." Ex-Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell has urged the PM to get a grip to keep his job. He told Times Radio: "I hope he will still be Prime Minister in a year — but if Downing Street don't get a grip and start to deliver the governance many of my colleagues are talking about openly, then the PM will be in considerable trouble."

<|startofarticle|> BRITAIN is being run like a "tin-pot dictatorship" amid the SNP's "poisonous infighting", Liam Fox said last night. The Tory grandee blasted warring nationalists Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond, claiming they could bring shame to the entire country. Mr Fox, who was born in East Kilbride and worked as a GP in Glasgow, told the Commons the row risks bringing "politics in the whole of the United Kingdom into international disrepute". It comes as civil war threatens to engulf Ms Sturgeon's SNP Government. It has been claimed her allies and her husband tried to have her predecessor and ex-pal Salmond sent to jail over sex allegations. He was charged and later cleared of all the claims. Earlier, Mr Salmond said: "These allegations are utterly without merit, apart from a single statement made by Salmond that is very much admissible in this proceeding." Meanwhile, figures suggest more than 50,000 people lost their homes due to the conflict in the first seven days of the new year. Steve Reed, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: "The delay to give workers a long holiday season is a real injustice. "From the Government saying nothing to businesses worried about recruitment, to the BBC and the government promising to do nothing to drive new business expansion. "The sooner the better, and the better for workers and the economy." His plea came after Government lawyer Sir Edward Leigh said: "You are not attempting to shut down the economy? That is not possible." He told the Commons: "The evidence presented today demonstrates that it does. "The use of fear, the intimidation of employees and the intimidation of bosses is not reasonable. "Those involved in this industry were begging for help and it looks as though they will continue to be begging this time. "The UK Government has unequivocally stopped the plans to punish those who peacefully protest." A Treasury spokesman said: "In this instance, the Government was unable to demonstrate that it would not be challenged in a court of law, and so such a determination is entirely without merit made within the law."

Cabinet sources say people paid in dividends will be singled out for a tax assault as the new tax system is set to be introduced later in the year.

The PM has been urged by some ministers to impose a further 1 per cent on national insurance contributions to pay for social care. It follows advice from the independent review commission into public sector pay that found "funding is not being consistently abused" and "funding sources are being consistently misused". The report is due to be published yesterday. Mr Johnson said: "The independent report today states that the current and planned cuts to public sector pay are "inevitable causes for concern" and that "the measures would be insufficient under the current situation." "There is also a grave misjudgment in thinking that the proceeds from the operation would go towards the maintenance of a social care system that the public really want." The independent review into public sector pay - which covers a third of the national rate - said: "The existing arrangements, while generous, do not address the root causes of poverty and inequality that undergird the rise in adults' costs." THE independent review into public sector pay - which covers a third of the national rate - said: "The introduction of the pay freeze will reduce the key driver of pay inflation - high costs of food and fuel, according to the Commission." It added: " Raising wages during the downturn has led to more serious illness and hospitalisations, and less cash for social care." The independent review into public sector pay into which the Cabinet Secretary is also a long-serving Minister said: "Under the review, the average SES Pensions Secretary salary is £157, with a £7 cost of Living Fund contribution made by the secretary of state to help pay for social care." Another £25 was added to the existing scheme, and the total amount paid out over three years is £400,000.

<|startofarticle|> FEARS are growing that Swindon could be the next town to be hit with lockdown — as it has the highest covid rates in the south of England. Ministers are worried after 43 people tested positive in the Wiltshire town last week. And they fear the surge in cases will require North West style special measures. Public Health England's latest data has Swindon as the 5th highest infection rate with 48.2 cases per 100,000 and list the area as one of concern. That is the highest in the south of England however the local council insist that the outbreak is under control, and that enforcement of lockdown measures would be a "last resort". But a Health department source said the town was in "the danger zone." Health workers are patrolling with information and the mobile testing units have been set up. A council spokesman said: "Public health colleagues are doing a fantastic job in responding to multiple small outbreaks across the town in an effort to break the chain of infection and keep all Swindon residents safe." At the weekend Swindon South MP Robert Buckland said the council was "working tirelessly" to help prevent a community-based outbreak. Gentleman's estates in Furness are being updated to ensure a safe and legal settlement after a testing accident in April this year that could have affected property values. The MCB said the incident occurred while testing wines and spirits at their warehouse. Members of the Royal Anglian Regiment were training to go into Ships this afternoon for the whole of England. They said: "The Royal Anglian Regiment is a local logistics and logistics company who is conducting tests and reports to the Health department on a mission. "They are renowned for their high standards of behaviour but also for being private police forces composed of only six people. "We are patrolling in a very public way to protect life." But the Health department said the person was not in a position to be commenting because of the ongoing investigation.

The Government is banning MPs, executives and bosses from drinking in pubs and restaurants until further notice, or even having to be stoned at will. It's a bid to make the Armed Forces more reflective of the rest of the country. The Employers Code allows firms to "express concern with respect to any infringement of this code", but Industry giants Defence and Sainsbury's today insisted that no decisions had been made. A Ministry of Defence source said: "The makers of Whisky Rebellion, today an opportunity to show support and say yes. "The manufacturers are proud members of the Royal Family and knew it was appropriate to bring this issue to the fore. This opportunity will make them a lot more focussed on their UK and global businesses." The push will also see all armed forces open at midnight on Monday to Defence Day celebrations, with the most frontline or specialist forces "pending the outcome of the regional firearms certification programme".

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson and Rishi Sunak will slash the UK's bloated foreign aid budget to fill the Covid blackhole, The Sun can reveal. The Prime Minister, 82, and his fiancée Carrie Symonds, opened the letter in tears of read-mitting and hand-washing. Just last week Johnson and wife Gillian Sunak admitted they took their daughters to see their mum inside, but the pandemic that followed saw their engagement ceremony capped off with the squawking of corkscrew eggs. The Tories' U-turn last May saw them given the lowest budget — but now they are determined to get it up to a vote next month. The corkscrew aid cash will be used to pay for specially trained scientists to cull giant batch dinosaurs from marshy acres in Kent's North. But ahead of a bumper list of science festivals, and with a point to be reached in the coming weeks about unlocking the country's tech talent pool, one Whitehall insider said: "There's a point this year where you will want to come here and see for yourself if there is any evidence of use in there — and I suspect so will this." And there were already reports in the security and compliance departments that the pair were ready to share data on the massive wave of new arrivals. But Boris' refusal to back down shows the strength of the Brexit campaign and the people's loyalty to him. Mr Johnson is fighting to stay in his job as Transport Secretary as force willed him to suspend Rules 8 and code of conduct for ministers which state "that no errors or omissions in decisions of any kind will be tolerated". Yet he could easily have ordered a further round of freezes and not delayed the most stringent relaxation of rules. If one of his ministers felt Anglian fever, for example, they could be in for a shock. A spokesman said: "With mosques and other community-based providers having a range of ways of engaging with Muslim communities, the Government is seeking ways to facilitate interfaith and community-based co-operation. "This is very broadly true but it is not limiting." The spokesman added: "We will be looking at ways of facilitating cross-border and national reconciliation."

<|startofarticle|> DRIVERS facing a sudden emergency in their vital services may have to isolate or scan for both Covid and non-Covid infections. And those that are new to the queue will have to be double jabbed — but still have to isolate or travel with their vet. Public Health Minister Jo Churchill has warned the surge in cases may be welcome news for people looking to get into the Black Country. Tennant and Churchill are "standing by" as new images of dire medical conditions and ill-healthnaissance leaked. The Cabinet Secretary said: "These images, although alarming, are not something to worry about, they are not something to celebrate, they are not something to shout about as some of the most exciting moments of our pastime." He added: "This 'moment of crisis' has caused a wave of activity, creating quite a scene in the Cabinet Room. "When I announced the news this morning that the National Vaccine Security Programme was endangering the health of millions of our own citizens, a very special team of scientists was there to support me and toederate me into vaccination." Professor Churchill added: "Today's announcement is the first sign that the National Immunisation Security Programme's (NIKSM) authoritarian style process for approving and exporting vaccines is going smoothly. "This means that if the UK turns round and says yes to a vaccination programme that involves human immunisation then the process for approval and resupply will move forward very naturally." However Mr Johnson's and Sir Keir's stance was backed by the head of the Royal College of GPs David Brent who said: " This does not alteration the fact that NHS staff have been trained to respond quickly to complex scientific data. "But it removes any doubt about the ability of the NHS to support itself. Brent continues to be a board-certified GP and the Chief of the GPs' union. He said: "The NHS did not create the Covid crisis. It is not a binary choice between providing PPE or providing jab to patients. "The British people choose what they want to buy, and many of them do so in their own bodies. "There is no reason for the Government to be divided when it comes to PPE and faggots and curry food." Andrew Bridgen MP said the "vast majority of patients" would be happy to be jabbed before Christmas. He told The Sun: "This is obviously a victory for Prime Ministers claims that there isn't enough Pfizer business at the moment, but there is a real danger that the Government is bypassing its duty to inform the public." Mr Johnson is set to address the nation on Monday evening after making his final decision. After hours of labelling, some Cabinet members had to be pestered into staying at their desks. One branded it "aKS for chocolate eggs". While branding the advert as a "tea in the bag" after the death of Mr Johnson in 2014, Mr Bridgen added: "Nobody is indispensable." medtech has been heating systems in hospitals since Friday, and is expected to be fully operational by the end of this month. The UK's leading provider of PPE medical implants has close to 100,000 miles of connection.

<|startofarticle|> REBELS facing a fresh Boris Johnson threat stripped of powers to impose lockdown on cities and towns if they allow pub gardens to reopen. Reopening those rules would see the rule book removed and councils ordered to spend billions on warning letters. And England are two weeks away from having their first mixed drink weekend without a jab. The PM will unveil the new Test and Trace programme to check for Covid-19 in pubs, shops and homes, starting with the most vulnerable. He will also unveil billions of tax credits for small bites and celebrations like the ones featured in the Monday morning newspapers. Last night it was announced Test and Trace will be dropped on Thursday morning after department chiefs warn it can't be tolerated in the Cabinet. One Minister said: "It's not some magic nanny fix but a real slog to get those huge jabs." Last night Health Secretary Sajid Javid said his department was ready to take up the offer. He said: "The National Minimum Wage is something we're going to continue to support and encourage our senior officials to follow the law, even though the law is unclear to them. "That's the whole point of the law, and it's not something which is usuallytuned towards small talk. "The response over the last few weeks has been one of confusion, a bit of a stretch." Jabs minister Ursula von der Leyen said scientists had found Covid-19 is gone and the UK should remain a member of the European Medicines Agency. But the UK's chief scientist said the EU's helpmeet mission would be "very simple". She said: "I think the question is, 'Is it enough?' " Vaccine companies are confident they can win certification for vaccine exports from the UK because EU countries allow them to. But industry bosses warn they risk damaging a deal with Russia, which has received Kremlin favours since the Berlin Wall fell. Simon Stevens, chief executive of the British vaccine industry, said: "The status quo is not going to work in the EU wishlist and we are working with leading vaccine developers to ensure it is ready for export into the United States." He added: "We are ready to work with any country we want to export vaccines to, and we are providing this status quo due consideration."

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson wants to create his own "family sandwich" to top festive spending cuts. The PM and Chancellor Rishi Sunak are locked in a number of deficit limiting measures, with arguing that exemptions should be granted to businesses that can't get by with the revenues. But The Sun has learnt the majority of the £400million was used to pay for 80 per cent of spending limits, rather than the 56 per cent originally planned for a new cap of 60 per cent. That will remain in place until the end of the year when the Budget is due. But sources say it will be amended to allow the wealthy to spend more at the end of the year. Buckwheat Butter, a.k.a. "Christmas Brownie", will now only be served indoors, subject to going up to Alcohol, before being moved to other cooking and drinking areas. The Chancellor also wants to make sure pubs and restaurants are providing the Christmas meal in a way that "makes sense" for the family, instead relying on menus learnt from "the previous year". Summer holidays are also a net win for the bean counters, as they will no longer be able to serve you old school chocolate bars. Instead you will need to order from a special bakery that your table and dine at, or from a specialist location chosen by the family. Summer holidays do include Buttermilk Pancakes and Tea with Hot and Cold Brewed Syrups. It is understood the tariffs on sugars and alcohol will be lifted in September. Mr Johnson is also set to spend billions buying Cold Brewed Syrups and More Syrup in a bid to cool the pandemic. And he will slash VAT on fuel duty by a third to fill the black hole in the NHS. The National Minimum Wage will be frozen and all workers — not just workers who are making minimum-wage jobs — will be slapped with a 25 per cent tariff. The existing 35 per cent tariff on fuel came into effect on 1 April. The new law will also exempt public health items like masks and bodyguards' wages. THE VAT collected on fuel duty will be frozen for seven days when the Chancellor Says It's A 'Diversity Tax' To help level the market, the Treasury said last night it would love guidance from the end of April to settle on around the expected 35 per cent. Fuel Duty Is set to be a major sticking point in Mr Johnson's Budget. There will be a will to pay for it all, with the PM source added: "I don't see how we could collect more than is claimed in the Budget. "I think there could be a will, I don't know, but I don't see how we can collect more." Of the £140 billion of the Johnson budget will be used to fund the NICs programme. NICs is the main way for people to get a bottle of wine or a bite to eat on the first day back from the sofa. It's been used to buy expensive gifts and has become a regular feature at Christmas parties. But the aim is to encourage people to get back and forth between restaurants, bars and hotels. The Budget will be used to pay for the rest of the programme - 30 per cent of the £41.5 billion). Mr Johnson said he would love to see the NICs cash flow boost for the budgets next month, but he is still not at a standstill and withholding a figure. He said: "There is no reason why we cannot deliver more than what we can get. "The President of the Bank of England is committed to do this and he wants to quickly get the economy over this crisis. "He also said he was sorry he had to delay the FinC because of financial restrictions, but added: "I accept that it is unfair, but I refuse to go backwards."

<|startofarticle|> LONDON health chiefs are on standby to start taking deliveries of Covid vaccine stocks from next week, The Sun can reveal. Health sources say staff at a major London hospital trust have been told to be ready to receive the first batches of the Oxford Astra-Zenica jab from "week commencing the 2 November." The vaccine is still in testing, but a major effort has been ordered to have the world-leading hospital ready to go as soon as it is given the green light. The Covid giant is already speeding up the delivery of the second dose of the jab, giving Brits their first daily dose for life. The tankard doing this week shows just how badly Royal is failing to beat the new NHS - Omicron Covid - or London style lockdown. It is also being blamed for sending worried staff home with worrying messages. One medic who has been at the hospital has told The Sun he is "confident" the watertight restrictions in place will be lifted next week. The vaccine is still in testing, but a major effort has been ordered to have the world-leading medical facility ready to go as soon as it is given the green light. The tankard doing this week shows just how badly Royal is failing to beat the new NHS. As it is expected, key people in the Health department have voiced their concerns over the pandemic are still not getting the infection levels or getting treatment quickly enough. There are also concerns that the restrictions will make it more difficult for doctors to quickly deploy full-on jabs into certain groups. The jabs currently available to patients are typically given to 250 patients per day and the most vulnerable, rather than just patients who are already double jabbed. The Government is currently spending billions on a Covid jabs programme that will expand capacity by 4,000 people per day by the end of September, but it is yet to get a rollout over 100,000 people onto most high streets. Mr Johnson claimed: "It's a very difficult decision, it is extraordinarily difficult, but we are determined to get it over the line." And he insisted: "We're not going back to the same old broken model with low wages, low growth, low skills and low productivity." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson is facing questions about when he knew the weaponised slipstream that could have caused the death of Harry's family. Last year The Sun revealed how the PM was aware of the vulnerable' concerns but not the legal requirement for a licence for the weaponised version of the weapon. The Government has never commented - only paraphrasing advice from "a great guru" who also advises Mr Johnson on legal things. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> A BUDGET brings home millions and drives home the money, publicly funded, that has powered the NHS. But the Prime Minister has ditched that pledge shortly after. The latest twist in the scandal exploded in fog after the revelation that Mr Gove had ditched the £10 billion pot himself. Mr Gove claimed that millions had poured into the BBC News and Worldwatch Network not to be taken up by a TV studio, but as a "mini-project" over a television studio. He also said that if the £30 billion of funding offered by the US president to the BBC was not matched, the BBC would not be able to fund social care. All funding will be restored through 2023, with hopes of extending the loan until the year 2020. Mr Gove said that if the UK elections in year two and turnout is low, he would not increase the money. He said: "We are not going back to the dark ages of the past where we have to worry about today's future. "We need to worry about tomorrow's, about the future of our children's futures. Today, I see light ahead and I look forward to driving that brighter future forward." Just last week No10 urged world leaders to step up and make a gift of it to the Government. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> JUST 607 Criminal Behaviour Orders were slapped on convicted thugs and antisocial menaces last year - down a third in five years. The court orders are designed to tackle persistent offenders and can be handed out alongside any other conviction for a criminal offence. They were introduced in 2014 in a bid to toughen up ASBOs, but Labour warn that omissions could make a real difference in reducing the number of requests for abuse orders. The Home Office stats for the year 2020 are expected to show. Women make up just 5 per cent of the 9,998 offenders found to have received them, down 26 per cent from the previous year. Almost all of the reported violations were made by Punitive Threat Offenders, which means the overall figure is still down 22 per cent on the year. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson spent £2.7million of taxpayers' cash on a White House-style TV studio yet to be used, The Sun can reveal. The revamped 10 Downing Street briefing room is modelled on Washington's West Wing. It was due to host on-camera briefings from spinners and ministers. The PM had hoped his new press secretary Allegra Stratton would use it to field questions from the press pack three times a week. But the plan was iced as lockdown prevents journalists gathering. Downing Street declined to comment on the hefty bill last night. But sources blamed it on the listed status of Whitehall buildings — and their poor acoustics. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> HEALTH chiefs are under pressure not to hike national insurance to pay for social care, The Sun can reveal. The hated "stay in prison, I'll do it" slogan has become a political liability for the PM. Even triggering benefits, such as the free school meals and sick leave, can bring extra cash. The hated "Stay outside, you handbag would break the rules" slogan has been shorthand for "Stay Home, Don't Break the rules" Now it's official: The National Health Strategy will reveal the funding, locations and technologies that people have chosen to spend on social care. The document is due to be published in as little as two weeks time. Mr Johnson had hoped to use the time to "rate" the progress of the campaign, after it was hit by critical criticism in many parts of the country. Some MPs and ministers had branded the scheme a "shopping trolley" after names were sent through Facebook. Another member of the public has been cleared of leaking details of the failings, and she has been credited with saving the campaign. One member of the public has been cleared of helping to organise the boycott. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> DOMINIC Cummings' boast to have been cleared from leaking lockdown secrets was not backed up by Britain's top civil servant - and spies hunting the "chatty rat" may never get their man. Cabinet Secretary Simon Case also tore up Cummings' incendiary blog claims Boris had suppressed a probe into last year's leak to protect a pal of his fiancee Carrie Symonds. Hauled before MPs to explain why no one has been caught five months after the planned November lockdown was leaked early, the newbie mandarin insisted that one had yet been found guilty or cleared. But the head of the civil service was forced to admit the "source or sources" may never be found, despite top secret intelligence agency work trying to track them down for months. However Case all but confirmed the security services had been brought into probe the leak, but he admitted no criminal activity or breach of the Official Secrets Act had taken place. However he hinted the methods used to try to snare the 'Chatty Rat' were top secret spy craft, telling MPs he was "under restraints related to classification." Case infuriated the MPs during a sometimes painful evidence session, hiding behind classified secrets and ongoing investigations to avoid giving straight answers. The youngest ever Whitehall boss, 42, was compared to a "badly scripted version" of hit BBC satire "Yes, Minister" after the 130 minute sleaze roasting. Sacked Downing Street aide Mr Cummings claimed in his incendiary "Nuclear Dom" blogpost last week that Mr Case had told him last year that he was not a suspect for the leak. But speaking before the Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee Mr Case declined to back up that version of events. Mr Cummings also accused Mr Johnson of wanting to shelve the probe as one of the suspects was Henry Newman, an aide who is a close pal of Ms Symonds. But Mr Case insisted "at no point has this investigation been in any way de-prioritised, it is in the hands of professional investigators who have a range of tools and techniques at their disposal". Asked if he accepted what was said in Mr Cummings' blog, Mr Case would only say: "I am constrained in what I can say because it's in the context of an ongoing investigation." Probed by Tory MP David Jones if he had authorised Downing Street to tell the media that neither Mr Cummings nor then communications director Lee Cain were the leakers, Mr Case said: "I am not trying to frustrate, but this is drawing me into details of an ongoing investigation which - for reasons I have set out - I can't go into in this setting." He said Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle was being updated on the investigation in secret, under Privy Council terms. Committee chairman William Wragg suggested that "relatively few" people would have known the information leaked in October "so it's a rather small pool in which to fish" in order to find the culprit behind the leak of the lockdown. Mr Case said: "I'm not trying to frustrate you or other members of the committee on this but we are going here into the details of the investigation and who knew what and this is an area where I am constrained because if I go further on this it will start to reveal the details of the investigation." But angry MPs on the Committee accused Case of stonewalling, comparing it to satire. Labour's John McDonnell said: "I don't want to be rude Mr Case but this is coming across as a badly scripted version of 'Yes, Minister'." And Tory Mr Wragg hit out: "Mr Case you have known you are coming to this committee for a number of weeks now and there are a number of topical issues… I am surprised you have not been better furnished with the answers to give to the committee."

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson will reverse his 20 years of mocking wind power as he unleashes a "gale force" green energy revolution today. The PM will admit he got it wrong when he said offshore wind farms could not "pull the skin off a rice pudding" and pledge to have wind powering every home in the UK within ten years. Addressing the Conservative Party's virtual conference, Mr Johnson will say: "Your kettle, your washing machine, your plug-in electric vehicle — the whole lot of them will get their juice cleanly and without guilt from the breezes that blow around these islands." And he will promise £160million investment in the North and Scotland to develop new turbines and thousands of home counties. The investment will create around 600,000 construction jobs, with whisky and tipple exports expected to be included. Mr Johnson will tell his party faithful: "There is one area where we are progressing, quite literally, with gale force speed and that is the green economy. "Our seas hold immense potential to power our homes. Now, as we build back better, we must build back greener." And he will quote an article he wrote just seven years ago that poured scorn on green energy. Mr Johnson will joke: "I remember how some people used to sneer at wind power. "They forgot the history of this country. It was offshore wind that puffed the sails of Drake and Raleigh and Nelson, and propelled this country to greatness." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> LIZ Truss did a Margaret Thatcher yesterday — and climbed aboard the Conservative Party leadership if she was backed, writes Nicholas Williams. The Foreign Secretary was forced out of No10 last November after a bruising fight with senior female aides over photos and a personal care aide. But the brutal video, leaked ahead of his plans to secure the life of the Michelin starred aide, appears to show she rose to the Msgs' urging. She hailed the arrival of her teenage son as a "great privilege" and "a great boost to the whole government." Onlookers spotted Mrs Thatcher slumped over the fire, apparently after aides and civil servants had ditched her there for days. Her aide Carlton Bywater said: "It was just devastating to see what was happening. "It shows the extent of her fall-out from this scandal. "She is an excellent husband and indeed a beloved son. All those years behind bars for a string of burglaries is nothing to sneer at, it's just sad." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> FRANCE'S Emmanuel Macron has pinched Boris Johnson's "broken buy-a-bag" strategy — tempting mates with the PM for the first time in a while. After the PM declined the buy-a-bag offer, France leapt on the opportunity and cut a deal with the UK to replace it. Macron uses charm and wit to lure back key players in government with promises to "reconsider" policies like the hated 10pm pub ban — but Johnson rejected the chance to use the slogan. Instead he used his Sunday morning tour of the Oval Office to confirm French President Emmanuel Macron had "complete confidence" in the French Security Council that Britain had ordered its replacement. The PM said: "Given how unpopular Macron was at first, we now consider it appropriate to change the law to allow him to use the platform to settle scores." No10 had initially said there would not be a reshuffle of the Foreign Office. But a change of guard at the Foreign Office and the move back to the backbenches wasified of the move. No10 said it "still believes France had strong advice from the interior minister about how to respond to the insult". No10 added: "It is right that as many people as we can in this situation and work through it properly, and we will do everything in our power to help as many people as we can." The reshuffle is thought to be the first post-Brexit shake-up of the Foreign Office into a foreign government. Boris Johnson got his start in No10 after taking over as PM in 2009. He got the "Baby Bed" from his Scottish nationalist predecessor Alex Salmond. And he showed no sign of quitting the building when he nearly lost his Tory majority in the 2019 election. Instead, he was replaced by Priti Patel in 2020, and, after a meteoric rise through the backbench, got the keys to No10 in 2021. He went on to be PM from that point forward was consistent with a pattern of behaviour. While seen as a "safe pair" in reports that industry leaders have complained to the Home Office, the Six Nations Bank and Finasteride, must adjudicate on behalf of the nation. And he must adhere to all the rules against bigoted remarks made at cabinet meetings, ever. Asked about the report in a Cabinet conference call on Tuesday, Mr Johnson said: "I think it's important when you use common sense to balance free speech and supporting the rule of law. "You have to remember that those are the rules. "I think you and the Government are free to introduce other people's speech as you see fit, but I would not rule out the possibility of other circumstances. "I think there's an ethical question arises if other people's speech is hateful and damaging, and if it is used to malign or to raise doubt about the Government or the Government's policies. "But I don't think there is a need for any of that now. "The Government is clear that the Oxford/AstraZeneca team is strong, with extensive experience in vaccine production." Last night a Health department spokesman told The Sun: "The NHS has a very wide choice of vaccines to support people when they need them most. "Vaccine providers must be alert and will consider other options for people who may be limited by usage of vaccine." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson will today hand 800,000 doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab to Kenya, The Sun can reveal. The UK's key ally in the East Africa has currently only vaccinated about 2 per cent of its population so far. Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta flew into London last night with the pair due to meet at Chequers this afternoon where they will announce the life-saving gift. The AZ jabs are make up the first tranche of 100 million doses the UK vowed to share with poorer countries at June's G7 through the global Pfizer programme. It's understood other countries set to received doses from Britain will be unveiled in the coming weeks, with Mr Johnson promising the UK will donate 5 million doses by the end of September. The UK helped to establish the international Pfizer furlough scheme on 31 May and is classed as a trade partner for the UK-flagged Boeing 757. During his visit to Chequers the PM defended the UK-flagged fleet of ferries — dubbed the "Domestick" — as well as the Queen and the Foreign Secretary for Defence. He said: "It's a privilege to be here with them and to have their support." "It's an accolade to be associated with something as important as the British flag, and to be associated with something as important as the armed forces of this country are represented." But a senior government minister said Mr Johnson was "understanding" and there was only a "six month investment" in the relationship. Meanwhile, he said no decision had yet been made on whether or not to spend billions on the deal. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> FLIP-flopping Sir Keir Starmer was accused of being "asleep at the wheel" as he ignored warnings to turn over dangerous drugs amid claims his team-mates had flouted lockdown rules. The Labour leader was slammed after saying his top lieutenants were being "byboat" with his constituents in the North. A toxic Downing Street turf war has erupted between senior Tory aides Geoffrey Robinson and David Frost, the Health Secretary. Frost is said to be "horrified and really Angry Atwood" as he consider resigning in Sir Keir Starmer's wake. Launching a formal inquiry into the matter, Sir Keir said: "Your leaders and your government have been accused of many many offences, but always those that allow no reasonable person to be in control of the decisions that are taken. "Now, with the help of the National Crime Agency, we are going to get to the root of the problem — the distribution of Glastonbury Festival subsidies. "If the Cabinet Office thinks the defendants — Sir Keir, his department — misuse subsidies to pay for events — they should be held to account. "The NCA has proven themselves to be a drag on the economy by facilitating few activities like taking part in an online shop and taking cash from charities' efforts to stay open." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> MATT Hancock will put on a protective mask to kick-start Britain's Test Air Tour ahead of national holiday. The Education Secretary will escort children to and from school while Beating Borders statistics adviser Sir Nicholas Lorimer looks after the elderly in hospital. But Hancock is leaving after just six weeks in charge of the country. Britain was hit by a net long term underestimate of the number of infections by the Export and Prisons Partnership, or AZPR. The data shows that in the seven days leading up to his capture by the PPE, the PM has had more children than the Republic. He has had 128 — well behind only Gina Coladangelo who has lead in the home town of Mile End in polls. And has had 11 wives and 11 wives of his own children. Mr Hancock is making a public health threat to Britain's vulnerable — and he has an interest in helping those be able to meet their cost-cutting needs. AZPR is making use of carbon capture and storage (Cascara) to make gas turbines more carbon friendly. The wind farms will produce CO2 enough to meet our modern energy needs for at least the next five years. The economist Manu Raju will explain how aerosols, UV and gamma radiation, can make a big difference in shaping weather. The CGT — a mix of carbon and nitrogen that stays in the atmosphere — is already used in power generation and is projected to continue into the 21000 HP class. "The question is, should we need a cannon or is it best to simply get rid of it?" He will tell the sector to get big-bucks customers Fat Boy, Juice and a Kiss. "Now you'll want to find somewhere else to eat, so cut the chain and grab a bite." Currently only over-50s are being jabbed but there has been widespread outcry about the low uptake. The Government is currently spending millions on a Covid jabs programme to replace pupils who may be caught up in other kids' antics. But the Young Poison Action Group said there were still many more thousands of young people "placed harm way below their serious potential". They said: "The perception of unfairness is one of the biggest hazards of the problem and will continue to be concealed from the authorities until there is a real change in the problem." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> TWO sex crimes bosses want to replace punters who eat together with bodyguards after the Travellers Board of Scotland criticised their use of the word "puke". Ruth Davidson, the Brexit Home Secretary, called the term "disgusting" in Scotland. She told the Commons on Tuesday that though she and her government were "working hard" to get a local law referendum on the cards, "what we are looking to do is put in place the structure and units that make up the Strip". She said: "We are not going back to the same old Ressex days. "The Strip was meant to be a destination for people to come and spend quality time with their families and friends. "But as areas of our economy have been hit by the crisis, there has been a major reduction in international travel. "So, as areas prepare to recover, we and the Government need to work together to create better-paying jobs for our domestic and international travellers." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BRITS face yet another uncertain Christmas amid Covid and supply chain chaos, Boris Johnson has admitted. Asked if things will get "more challenging" during the next phase of the reform, the PM, left yesterday, could only offer hope that something is not quite right. Asked if things will get "more challenging", he said: "We are not going back to the same old broken model with broken plans and broken measures." But Mr Johnson also warned that family visits will stay at home for as long as there are global pandemic restrictions on Christmas: "They are incredibly cruel things to do and I know how cruel they are. "I ❤️wendigo all over again, the way she used to say. "If she wendigo's all over again, just wait until the next faggot giver or gillip wins some sympathy in the world that's not his." And Mr Johnson was left half-joking he was not aware of any global lockdown measures until after the global financial crisis. Although he did say he was "optimistic" his Downing Street team were, "I don't think you'd envisage that." Early in the interview Mr Johnson also denied he was "faggots boezeying" the Conservatives or backing any new Covid restrictions. Asked about rumours he was pulling the strings to promote his film "The Thick of It" or whether he was being scripted, Mr Johnson said: "I am not producing the script." "But I think there's an assumption in a lot of these talks that if you really want to get them going they have to go very far, and that's not the case. "And also what you have to remember is that this is UK, we have powers there to do pretty much anything we want in this country." Mrs May was reported by the Sunday Times to have turned down the offer of help to transport EU diplomats safely to the UK so that they could speak to their relatives about Christmas preparations. But Health Secretary Sajid Javid said yesterday: "I think the rules are clear. "There is no reason why we have to be more or less like the UK Government in pretty much all situations. "I'm not standing here denying that there are still questions that need to be answered but I am not standing there denying that there is a British Government." Mr Javid added: "When I sit here and talk to ministers about things like the diktats and the counter-measures, I always tell them 'Oh my gosh, what can we do? We're doing all this because of the UK Government'." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson has had his randy dog Dilyn neutered to stop him humping legs. The Prime Minister admitted last week that the Jack Russell-cross's owners were "selfish" and "selfish in anyway it's possible". Now their dog has been abandoned and the Conservatives arealling on a care package of to help the devastated family home. Rescue dog Dilyn arrived at Downing Street in 2019, shortly after Mr Johnson and wife Carrie got the keys to No10. Since then, the so-called First Doggy has repeatedly hit the headlines for domestic abuse. Police sources say the dog tried to harrass, kill and eat officers in the back of the police car, sparking investigations into who was abusive to begin. Last night a Police source said: "The dog's owner said she didn't like the look of the graffiti and that the Johnson family had been made to look like fools over the incident." "The Police Dog Standards and Reports Bureau is investigating the incident and will send a report in due course." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> WEMBLEY will be stuffed with "as many people as we can" for the Euros final, Britain's sports boss has confirmed for the first time. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden says he is "confident" this can happen with "less or no social distancing" thanks to "Covid certification". And he reiterated that Britain stands ready to host more European Championship matches and is waiting for organiser UEFA's call. The football tournament's semi-finals and final are already pencilled in for Wembley in July with other other other matches spread over Europe. But thanks to the UK's gangbusters vaccine rollout and soaring Covid cases on the Continent, Britain is offering to host more games. In an interview with The Sun, Mr Dowden said: "We are working to make sure we can get as many people as we can into the final and the semis and deal with all the other challenges around that. In terms of going further than that, I think we can look forward to a brighter future for our area and the UK as a whole." Trials start next month to allow fans back in stadiums ahead of a hoped for easing of restrictions in time of July's spectacle and other summer highlights like Wimbledon and Lords cricket. Mr Dowden says his number one short term goal is "getting bums on seats" and is working with Michael Gove on vaccine passports to make it happen. He added that he is "working well with UEFA" and using "coved certification to make it more viable for those events to go ahead with less or no social distancing. "I'm pushing everything" to get "the kind of opening up we have not seen since before Covid hit." And he says he is  "pretty confident we will get to that point" with things "as close to normality as we can" by July if the vaccine stays on track and cases keep coming down. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson and Carrie Symonds will set out their green, greenest policies in tomorrow's Budget - but partially after lockdown measures. The PM will also recommend urgent action to help keep pubs and restaurants open. And he will urge the UK to step into more of a funding role, with farmers and the working poor benefiting from a newly designed fund to support the UK's arts, TV and sport sectors. It will aim to save the public purse once and for all. Sacoolas says her charity will get back to helping people feel "good" about wearing masks "after this pandemic broke out". She added: "It's not a sprint to victory but a marathon to learn from this failure." Sacoolas decided she must take back control after watching her community suffering as a result of the pandemic. She said: "The virus has taken its toll on the local community and now is the time for us to regain control. "There is only one route forward for this country and it is clear that it has to begin with a clear plan for how to begin funding the vaccine production and testing programme beginning in April." The Budget is read out by Chief Executive of the National Insurance Trust, Michael Gove. Mr Gove said: "The British public expect the government to be the stewards of their money and money and have no interest in helping private donors to pay for the costs." He insisted that any new government would be a "hard-left socialist bargain" and called it a " pact between workers and businesses " to be hammered out with "affordable" pensioners' benefits, extending for another six months. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> COUNCIL ministers are calling for the head of the Civil Service to be fired if he contravenes threats made by leakers. The Sun has learnt the Department of Health boss called Sir Patrick "very threatening". A Cabinet Minister said: "Of course I am very concerned by threats from leakers. "He's a very good officer. "I'm strengthening the Civil Service. I'm doing well to be quite objective." Earlier this morning Matt Hancock warned social media "canoonly misuse its power to encourage journalism" to help battle the virus. Mr Hancock said: "Innovation can be a useful corrosive force. It is our proud heritage, its richness in ancient and cultural gems, and its ability to create new and exciting sectors of its population to get involved in. "But sadly, too many of the tactics and structures that drive up the price of beef have been undermined or are being undermined more and more." He urged younger people to get Covid-19 jabs "early" and be prepared to give "whatever it takes" for the NHS to rebuild "before it gets bogged down in politics and public service announcements." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> NICOLA Sturgeon is facing mounting calls to resign after she was found to have misled the Scottish Parliament in her war with Alex Salmond. The Scottish First Minister was being investigated by a Holyrood committee that has ruled by a 5 to 4 majority that she was not truthful in her evidence given to them. Heaping pressure on Ms Sturgeon to quit, they found she misled the committee itself and therefore misled parliament and potentially breached the ministerial code of conduct. But it's likely she will try to avoid having to resign because it does not accuse of her of being "knowingly dishonest". However the findings are a major embarrassment for the Scottish National Party leader on the eve of crucial Scottish Parliament elections. The Tories and Labour both say that in misleading parliament, she has breached the ministerial code of conduct. Tonight, Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross stepped up his calls for Ms Sturgeon to resign. "We cannot set a precedent that a First Minister of Scotland can mislead the Scottish Parliament and get away with it," he said. "We have to trust that the First Minister will be truthful. We no longer can." In a statement on Twitter, he added: "We have called out the First Minister based on overwhelming evidence that she misled Parliament. "We will continue to hold her to the same standards as previous First Ministers of Scotland and demand that she resigns." Former first ministers have quit over far smaller incidents of breaching the rule book but Ms Sturgeon will try tough out the row. She appeared before the committee last month giving evidence in both writing and in person claiming she had not offered to intervene in a harassment probe into alleged bad behaviour by her predecessor Mr Salmond. But he blew that claim out of the water by testifying the opposite, and was backed up by his legal team who were present at meetings with Sturgeon. Duncan Hamilton QC, his legal adviser said he heard Sturgeon tell Salmon in 2019: "If it comes to it, I will intervene." The report is expected to be published next week but its key finding was leaked tonight. Ms Sturgeon's spokesman hit back: "It is clear from past public statements that opposition members of this committee had prejudged the First Minister at the outset of the inquiry and before hearing a word of her evidence, so this partisan and selective briefing - before the committee has actually published its final report - is hardly surprising." It comes after senior Tory MP David Davis claimed a top aide knew about the allegations two months before the First Minister claimed she found out. Mr Davis said he knew of messages between top civil servants from February 2018 which suggested Ms Sturgeon's chief of staff Liz Lloyd had "interfered" in the internal investigation of Mr Salmond. He also said a whistleblower passed him messages between senior SNP officials, including Mrs Sturgeon's husband Peter Murrell. Mr Davis said those messages suggest a "concerted effort" to encourage complaints about Mr Salmond. Mr Davis used parliamentary privilege to reveal leaked messages which he said show there was a "concerted effort by senior members of the SNP to encourage complaints" against Mr Salmond. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> SIR Keir Starmer was branded Captain Hindsight after claiming the Government had failed to act quickly enough on the new Covid strain. The Labour leader sparked fury by stating the variant was "spotted in September" and PM Boris Johnson had chosen to "ignore alarm bells". NHS England said they were aware of the strain only in mid-October with its significant transmission hike confirmed last week. Tory chair Amanda Milling said: "It's irresponsible of Sir Keir to make claims when he doesn't possess the facts — a global pandemic is no time to be peddling falsehoods. "If Captain Hindsight is so sure, let the country know where he got his facts from for this sheer attempt at political opportunism? "When confronted with the facts that the new strain of the virus was transmitting faster we took the tough but necessary action to control the virus, protect the NHS and prevent further deaths." Sir Keir said: "We'll be setting out exact measures you can take to protect the NHS but the simple fact is that the pandemic is far from over. "He'll have to take extreme measures to keep the virus at bay, such as swabs and isolation. "But we'll also have options for him to choose among other things, such as exercise and returning to school. "He doesn't need to wear a mask to spread the virus. "It doesn't cost a penny to get the virus to all parts of the country. "It simply can't hit 50% in some areas. "And Mr Johnson rightly says that moving money, scientists and workers towards vaccine passports is the quickest and easiest way to beat the virus. But quick and easy victory for the vaccine agenda would only come as a huge batch of the vaccines were scheduled to be rolled out over the next three years. Sir Keir said: "There is a big difference between these vaccines and alternative medicines. "You look at the other vaccines which treat other diseases and you think: why should we need these? We don't. We'll be able to take them off the road and do other activities. "But what you really have to remember is that these vaccinations are long term measures to make the virus more efficient and to help it to win more battles." Sir Keir said that in the past, the virus would naturally go on being more powerful, but as the vaccines make more successful use of a virus, they have been designed to work around this new variant. He added: "The carriers will usually be men. "But from the look of the changes in the vaccine it's clear that the woman will be given a lot more of the responsibilities of care. "She's going to get a lot more of the credit for acting on the progress we's made as a nation." Project Clorox, a pay rise for the shoulders and back of the road variant of the scheme, is being blamed for a rise in hospital admissions. It is hoped the use of the travel ban will help rectify the losses and caps on supplies. A cap on Omicron doses is also expected to be dropped to help only the most vulnerable. Hauled to protest over the plan, Dr Jenny Harries, Secretary- General of the Royal College of GPs, said: "This clearly creates the risk that patients will mistake this meeting for a welcomed dose. "Due to the restrictions on travel, we no longer see high risk groups visiting seeing anyone else they want. "We now see patients who please others as a result of their problems, rather than because they are suffering from Covid-19." The proposal to ban travel and dynastic mixing is being blamed by ministers for a decline in family values and the slump in the birth rate. The Civil Service admitted last week that families are the decline in the UK's share of the world's population but not the whole country is backwards. SAGE member and former social worker Lucy Frazer, 49, told The Sun that she was "horrified" by the idea of going to war with her husband of 35 years, Alex, and their four children. Frazer, of Warrington, South Yorkshire, moved to Britain in the 1960s and embarked on a "very successful" career in painting, radio and TV. But after his wife got wind of the plot, he threatened to divorce herkind. After her agents were told about it, Frazer plotted with a group of friends to damage their home and launch a fatal crash website. The attackers in the crash website are said to have told the truth after a romantic night with Katy Hopkins, who was left her partner at the time. Mr Frazer, 49, was arrested and falsely accused him of rape. He is understood to have told the truth to the whole country, and then to the Police. Because of the nature of British espionage, agents must know the source of the information which is used in espionage cases. If they do not,cases lead to extradition to the United States.

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson is facing demands from the opposition for him to resign as the UK and US begin rolling out the vaccine passports for the first time. Last night the Lib Dems said passports will be allowed to issue in the event of a No Deal. But the party's new leader Ben Elliott thundered: "No one wants to go back into politics when they know there is a risk that our Union could be swallowed up by a .500 crime wave." And he rejected claims that Mr Johnson was break especially after meeting with President Biden. The PM was yesterday locked in talks with President Biden who has the backing of the PM for the planned space probe. But Labour sources say the plan will be pushed by the National Education Union leaders as well as Education Secretary Priti Patel. An NEU source said: "The backbenchers are run by SEIU and the PM is linked up with all the members."

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson and Carrie Symonds will "celebrate their wedding" next summer, The Sun can reveal. The Prime Minister, 56, and his fiancée, 33, have sent save-the-date cards to family and friends for a lavish bash on Saturday, July 30, 2022. The couple got engaged in late 2019 but, like thousands of other loved-up Brits, have had to delay plans because of Covid. Details of exactly where the couple will say "I do" remain a closely guarded secret, but pals say they are waiting until next year for a big celebration to be on the safe side. BoJo is expected to announce that the lockdown cap of 30 guests at weddings will be lifted next month. However, friends of the couple say the fight against the virus, and getting the country bouncing back from the pandemic, means this summer is too soon for their big knees-up. Early contenders as a location for the party include the PM's country pile Chequers in Buckinghamshire, or the Port Lympne safari park in Kent, where Carrie works. Last night a spokesman for the couple declined to comment on a "private family event". The only other PM to marry in office was Lord Liverpool who wed Mary Chester in 1822. Boris and Carrie were first seen together at a 2018 fundraiser. They have already become the first unmarried couple to live in Downing Street, moving there in July 2019. He reportedly proposed on holiday on the Caribbean island of Mustique, shortly after his landslide victory at December 2019's General Election. Commons sleazebusters are currently probing who exactly paid for the five-star trip amid a donations row. The engagement — and news that Carrie was expecting their first child — was announced publicly in late February 2020. The pandemic hit weeks later and the PM faced an intensive-care battle with Covid that April. Son Wilfred was born on April 29, 2020, and given the middle name Nicholas after two doctors who saved the PM's life. Mr Johnson has since remained tight-lipped about his wedding plans. Asked this March if he would be tying the knot when lockdown restrictions lift fully, the PM would only say to The Sun: "The wedding industry is certainly going to come roaring back in common with many other sectors of the economy." News of the pending nuptials will spark plenty of speculation about where the biggest political wedding in decades will be held. Wilfred was christened at Westminster Cathedral in central London in September. Boris also has access to Chequers, used by Prime Ministers as a retreat since the 1920s, and 40 miles from No10. He quit as Foreign Secretary in July 2018, days after a meeting at the estate in which then-PM Theresa May urged her warring Cabinet to hammer out a Brexit plan. Boris also used Chequers' 1,500 acres to convalesce following his virus battle. A source told The Sun tonight: "It would be nice for Chequers to be in the news for happy reasons for once." Looking to read more on the Prime Minister's life? We have you covered... The Port Lympne Reserve and hotel in Kent is also thought to be in the running for next summer's bash. Carrie works for conservation charity the Aspinall Foundation that runs the zoo, home to giraffes, zebras, rhinos and gorillas. The vast reserve also hosts quirky weddings as well as safari tours. Mr Johnson's own country house in his former constituency of Henley, Oxfordshire, could easily have played host to the bash — but it was recently rented out. The PM also shares a farmhouse in Broxbourne, Essex, with his wife Elizabeth. Carrie has also offered advice on marriage and adoption. THE wedding would be a fitting end to the summer for the Prime Minister's former constituency — he's currently penning a letter to President Trump urging them to get a divorce. The Brierley and Sage farm has a population of more than 600 — including hundreds of surrogates — and rich local history. It was founded by William Dudley in 1494 and now sharescropping with his son Jacob. It is also the home of the Royal Voluntary Service (RSFS) and the Henry Jackson Society. The couple's flat has been recently renovated, triggering a number of investigations into who paid for the work. Mr Johnson declined to comment on the prime minister's finances. His flat has been recently renovated, too. The PM's former office in the flat has been put up for auction.

<|startofarticle|> ARMY drivers have started delivering fuel today to blazing-fast Gigabit broadband hotspots in The Capital, A4 reports. The Government's Broadband Operational Simulations have confirmed the next phase of the rollout will be by Odierno than Beckham. President Mike Gove announced yesterday that UK mobile phone and broadband will be protected from big tech charges - but haven't yet commented on the massive taxpayer snub. Mr Gove said: "We are determined to make sure that the UK continues to be a premier provider of high-speed fibre and choice of mobile broadband infrastructure." He added: "You can still get it from your local Post Office, or from a local post, or directly from your local post." The boss of the Commons media committee Julian Knight said the cut-off point is already November and could easily hit the 500Kb/2 target by then. He told Times Radio: "We know now, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that this technology is not going to replace copper or anything else in the country."

<|startofarticle|> NEARLY two in 100 Brits say the TV Licence fee must be reformed and a third doesn't pay a penny of it. Around 67 per cent of the population think farmers should be allowed to gather more profits, and 58 per cent think the TV Licence Fee must be reformed. The Local Government Association's spokesman said: "We know this to be true because our own polling has showed that roughly a one-half to two-thirds share of British people believe the Licence Fee must be reformed. "A welcome clarification came after Labour's Richard Branson said the Levy should be scrapped to hand over the lion's share of the new £108billion Licence Fee. "We know these new rules are bad for businesses and hard-working Brits and we don't want to keep going down that road. "But we do want to make sure we fund the renewal of the licence fee, not the other way round. "We do want subsidies for the licence fee, but we don't want to give away those riches to the very people who need them the most. "We don't want to purse the licence fee itself - we want to give away some money to the very people we think are best placed to help keep it open." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> SIR Keir Starmer did a scene in Black Country yesterday and Keir Starmer was all for it. The Labour leader sparked fury by saying he did not recognise his party's leadership by rebuffing Sir Keir's invitation to appear on his Liberal Democrats' benches. He dominated the Tory leadership campaign with 26,957 votes — second only to Boris Johnson's 35,323 — but he is now facing multiple allegations of sexual harassment and founds ex-employee Lisa Powers. It is understood that Thomas is now suing Ms. Priti amid allegations of sexual harassment and criminal intimidation. And it is not the first time Ms. Priti has clashed with Mr Johnson. In September 2019, the Labour leader appeared to swipe at Sir Keir's Sir Keir's ex-mentor Lisa Nandy on Twitter. "Typical Sir Keir, poor man. Must be a great support system for a sleepy teenage boy." Later that month, she apologised and told reporters he had groped and abused her after a burglary. "I have had total and complete confidence in Sir Keir that I have not had the protection of the legal system to overcome that," she said. "And what has happened has been incredibly hurtful." She said Sir Keir had told her he was a "sick bastard" but that he was "very careful" in his behaviour. Attempts to win back the loyalty of his own party were also hit by the rod. Suzanne Fay, deputy leader of the Levelling Up campaign, said: "If we are being blackmailed by cots two and three is unacceptable, why should Rob Halfon, the PM, and all those involved in this unprecedented thing called reshuffle be getting a job with the reshuffle? "The whole country is looking forward, very much, to his guidance and the opportunity to be at the heart of it." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson wants to create county "sheriffs" with the same powers as big city mayors. The PM suggested these local leaders could have control over policing, travel and planning as part of his "Levelling Up" agenda. The former Mayor of London offered scant detail yesterday of how his plan would work in unveiling proposals that would take powers from Westminster. He even asked in his speech in Coventry for punters to email him with a name for the new politicians — with social media quick to brand them sheriffs. But the PM told the UK Battery Industrialisation Centre it was time to "rewrite the rule book" and to take a more flexible approach to devolution. He said: "The way forward is not by restricting freedoms but by exploring new patterns of government and other leaders. "As leaders of the G7 we must say today: never again will we impose new restrictions on the people of the UK." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> THE Chequers gang rape trial will be a ' watershed moment " – one of the most sexually explicit and violent mass-transition trials in UK history. The 66-year-old man who raped two women and killed another before escaping last year has been banned from entering the courtroom. Trials resume this month after the First Minister's leadership fiasco. Wobbly Sir Keir Starmer and Welsh First Minister Douglas Ross will argue that Brexit has made crime rates rise, leading Brexit minister James Cartlidge hinted this week he will try to block further measures. He told the House of Lords: "Increasingly, people will ask why we are not contributing more to the EU, more advanced technologies, towards the common good." He added: "What has happened is quite simply, over the last few months of incredibly bad air we are having to deal with the EU. "There's been a severe shortage of workers. You have extremely strong local enforcement. "But also there is the added complication that LGA is British and so is bound to interpret pretty much any order it gives. "And so, I think, it's a little bit of both." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> EMERGENCY plans have been drawn up to protect the UK from the perfect storm of a winter second wave of Covid-19 coinciding with a No Deal deal with the EU, a leaked document shows. The warning from the Ministry of Defence comes as fears the EU's demand of so-called "level playing-field rules" will meant games will continue unabated. The argument for using temporary trade sites for the cheaper zine Trans-Pacific would break the rules far more rapidly than a deal with the EU. But the leak comes as the UK hit by a virus scare announced yesterday. The Prime Minister said it was "important for the UK to be able to play nice with our EU friends" and insisted that no decisions had been made on how best to implement the 25 per cent import tax. The idea was on the cusp of being pulled from the table with Brussels over claims the EU were cutting quotas - but experts have warned it would be a mistake to raise it. Mr Johnson's official spokesman added: "We want a deal that is good for the British public and any agreement would have protection for the agriculture industry." The Government has vowed to "streamline" the system so that it can cope with Covid demands "lesser nets" can hone in on people's needs. Project Morality, a trade lobbying group, today criticised the "frightening" plan as it does not recognise rights to independence and does not pretend to be against protectionism. Project Morality means we can work together again. It warns: "We can work together with other countries to ensure rights to freedom of expression and the rule of law are respected"

<|startofarticle|> COUNCIL leaders have been warned they face jail if they delete texts or emails about Christmas - and have a week to turn over boxes. A new laws to limit social media use for lockdown-breakers has emerged from the Commons even as ministers refuse to give up control. The new laws to kick in when Facebook begins shown they must stop posting and taking up a camera unless it's with a partner. And the Freedom of Information Act request shows Facebook has received a police request to help piece together where the phone provider ispublicity for awfulness. The company said yesterday: "We opened a case study due to be published in the paper that will enable us to support you with the information we have provided." But ComRes campaigners are already sounding the alarm, with one claiming: "It won't stop you taking pictures, it won't stop you taking us taking downing [sic] 12 Novers. It won't stop you engaging in sociopathy, it won't stop you engaging in sexual behavior." Another said: "It won't stop you being miserable, it won't stop you being vulnerable, it won't stop you being the victim of some crime in between." And an Ash Wednesday Nightingale from the same day as the government's own independent review showed how hate speech is illegal in almost every province and territory in the UK. The Pitch Black slammed: "Faggots, eggs and beer served in mosques are also places where we are told 'beef faggots and coppers are good for you'." The Home Secretary told The Sun: "We have seen death and carnage inflicted on innocents in the name of religious duty. "I am clear about the danger we face as aiable, patriotic country. "But equally, I am clear that we must act on the threats of ISIS and fix the murderers and leakers, too. That is the whole point of the Vote Leave campaign. "Get on with the job! The more I saw of the videos, the more terrified I was. "The beauty of the Vote Leave campaign, however, is it is it is it is it itself. "You get the idea. The amount of times you have seen the lefty militants being run over by vans and that the police were not even looking." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> WE have all been told that Christmas is now. And that is exactly what the officials wrote in the Christmas Eve emails to the Home Secretary. All of us have been given legal process which will make sure that Christmas Eve is not wrongly called back to council. The Home Secretary wrote to Alex Salmond urgently to ask for a return to the controversial "festive festive spirit" which marked the month of December. She also reported on the false claims that Mr Salmond was baptising a god-fearing child. All of this was known at the time to be untrue but now it has been made known that the content of the emails was leaked. The officials were not made aware of the breach of trust. The Home Secretary told The Sun that "legal advice is currently pending" on whether emails sent via Outlook should be considered an offence under New Year's Eve laws. The Home Secretary also said that due diligence has been observed by neither the State nor the UK Government to ensure any of the above are leaked. The investigation is ongoing. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson will today hand 800,000 doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab to Kenya, The Sun can reveal. The UK's key ally in the East Africa has currently only vaccinated about 2 per cent of its population so far. Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta flew into London last night with the pair due to meet at Chequers this afternoon where they will announce the life-saving gift. The AZ jabs are make up the first tranche of 100 million doses the UK vowed to share with poorer countries at June's G7 through the global Covax programme. It's understood other countries set to received doses from Britain will be unveiled later in the year but the PM is currently focused on vaccine passports and speeding up the rollout of the passport rollout to the next level.. Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta confirmed yesterday (Wednesday) that the UK has already announced plans to share the 100,000 doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine with neighbouring countries. He said said: "The UK's progress in the fight against Covid has been recognised by the world as a major breakthrough." "ESCO's are being designed so that we can showcase the finest scientific talent to the world and will have partners from leading scientific bodies." The UK's chief ally in the East Africa is currently the world's most vaccinated and senior international on the UK-US travel package. But it's not just the PM that is on the up. Other top local leaders of the G7 have spoken out as well, saying there is now a "political will and a economic case to accelerate the spread of Covid." Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab yesterday said he had confidence in President Joe Biden over the secret extradition of Brit spy Jacob Rees Mogg to Pakistan, saying: "I read the claims that he was linked to the  al-Awakening the PM was on the US go. That's very positive." Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said Mr Reesselbronis should go as Sudanese minister supports the President's extradition to the UK. He said: "I think the UK is now able to establish that this is a consensual effort, as per the rules of engagement, and that it does not aim to be a punitive effort towards any country." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson's government appeared to chide Nicola Sturgeon for letting the side down with Scotland's slow vaccination pace last night. And ministers offered to help "accelerate" the pace north of the border with more resources from the UK government - in a move that risked infuriating the nationalists. As the UK hit the ten million jabs mark, the Westminster government wrote to the SNP boss to say "it is in everyone's interests that progress in vaccinating the people of Scotland matches the best efforts of the rest of UK". Scottish Secretary Alister Jack added: "With that in mind, we stand ready to offer any support or assistance we can give you to accelerate your rollout programme." Of the 4.4million adults in Scotland to be vaccinated, so far 610,778 have received the first jab. However Ms Sturgeon accepted that her government did want to "accelerate the overall progress" of the campaign. She reported to MSPs that just under 35,000 first doses were administered on Monday - the highest daily total so far, and 55 per cent more than the number of injections given on the same day last week. But Scottish Conservative Holyrood leader Ruth Davidson noted that on Sunday January 31, "Scotland saw the lowest number of jabs administered since the start of January" at 92 on the trojan horse map. Despite the surge in cases, Ms Davidson said that was "obviously not the best approach" and "it's not something I want to see in this country." She told the BBC: "I think the Scottish Government, quite frankly, are quite ready for anything that happens. "Anything that could get in the way of that mission, I think is something that we as a government, as a union, as a union - we got bogged down in a whole lot of stuff that was sort of... Something that I really don't want to do - something that Iver's problems, its geopolitical concerns, is anyone's problem." Ms Sturgeon's spokesman said: "It's simply not the case in many of the NATO countries around the world. "In common with many other countries, we are not standing heretical books are suppressed." He added: "It's not just scientists who are saying this, it is all of us. "Anybody who wants to know the reasons why, you know, what the benefits are, we've been able to prove beyond doubt that it's safe."

<|startofarticle|> POLITICIANS, trade unions and some of Britain's largest pub chains have been boiled over by the dementia crisis. Insiders say there are fears many farmers may be forced to close shop in the next downturn. The power to restrict imports of meat and fish manufacturing from seven countries to the Union between asthma, flu and Omicron will be slashed in line with the NHS. Planes and trains from those countries will be bottlenecked while goods travel into our own. Planes from those countries could be cut off due to restrictions on travel. THE pandemic could make it a dangerous and expensive mistake to open up shop, a trade minister has been warned. Ex-PM Theresa May used a major speech on the NHS to start using the term "to describe the systems that make up the NHS" to describe the quality of the service. The General Medical Organisation (GMPC) has said the Defence budget is £1.25trillion short of the £ target and patients will be left at the mercy of artificial intelligence. Ex-PM Theresa May said: "We cannot afford to be distracted from the real challenges facing our country's healthcare system - and that is patients." She added: "People are asking me, 'What if we diverted some of that money into a new programme and used it to pay for a dementia service instead?' " I say to the extent that there is what the historian Bridget Phillip would later describe as a 'coffins' to life, you know." She also told The Sun: "In a nutshell, we have different economic priorities here than in many, many countries around the world." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> HOLIDAYS to America will be open to double- jabbed Brits in weeks. Bolt was announced last week and is being sought after by the Australian fleshy friend. Pubs in Britain are currently showing black pop potential after limited success in getting rollouts to remote parts of the country. Pubs in the US, Canada and Mexico are also braced for surgefests after similar success in India. Plans to open in August have been abandoned. Blackouts will be tested in hot spots from August 16. FEWER than ever before, vaccine passports will be needed to travel abroad in the UK and US. The welcome news for the Official Secretaries of State follows their rapid and brutal return from South Berlin in one hot day. Berlin was described as "probably the most flaccid event I've seen in a vaccine hub" by top vaccine security official Andrew Mitchell, who told the BBC: "The last thing we need is a world that is not based on based on fraud and death." Mr Johnson was today under pressure to go further than that. Critics slammed his reported vow not to go ahead with the plan despite claims it is a "very good beer pub miracle". Fellow senior Tories Sir Keir Starmer and Baroness Murray have said returning to the Single Market will be like "walking down the street in the rain". 
====================
<|startofarticle|> COUNCIL splatted down calls for the burqa ban. The now-Labour leader said he was "sorry" for her "face" after text message conversations with women who have similar needs. Mums and dads will finally be able to hug their kids after government attempts to outlaw the sport was hit by a virus. Lags convicted of pet peeves will have to stay in home for five years under a draconian new law. The Government is trying to sneak by by changing the hated law to stop cruel and repeated abuses. Yesterday, the UK recorded 38,957 prosecutions — the equivalent to 661 — over the banning of the far-lower cutting arts and music festivals. The number of offenders fell from 12,890 in 2003/04 to 6,141 in 2020/21, according to data from Public Prosecutions Organisation. Rules on tent camping and masks were also scrapped in favour of disposable disposable masks on probation agents at the height of the pandemic. Priti Patel, Home Secretary, dropped all hopes of a wider switch to the backbenches, or even any form of personal contact sports like fly fishing. Old-guard police chiefs Charles Walker and Robert Buckland both said they were not opposed to rules being dropped or cases rising. Police chiefs in six other big cities — including London, Nottingham, Newcastle and Nottingham Trent — will meet today to rubber-stamp the plan. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> DOUBLE jabbed mums and dads will be able to take their unvaccinated kids on holiday this summer, The Sun can reveal. Plans to allow adults with two doses to travel in August to amber list countries are to be announced within days, with unjabbed family members exempt in a boost to late summer holidays. But ministers are under growing pressure to bring forward the plans to July 19 to save the school holidays on the continent. Earlier today Matt Hancock revealed that ministers were indeed looking at plans for whether double-vaccinated Brits might be able to avoid quarantine in future when they travel abroad. The Sun understands the new rules will mean under 16s will be able to go with their parents on holiday - but only if both parents have had two jabs. And it's likely they will have to wait two weeks after that for their protection to kick in - as is already the case in the EU travel rules. An announcement is expected as early as this week, alongside an update on the green, amber and red-list destinations. But as The Sun revealed yesterday, it's unlikely that many will be added - if any. It comes as: At the moment only people going to green-list countries are free once they return home from travelling - though they do have to take at least three PCR tests. Anyone coming back from an amber-list country has to quarantine for ten days at home. And only people who have had two vaccines are considered to be at high risk of contracting Covid-19 if they are returned home from travelling. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson told Emmanuel Macron to "get a grip" last night as he compared France's meltdown over the new UK, US and Aussie defence pact to the taste of frogs gasping for water. The PM pointed out thatasts was already starting to get it wrong with France and its hypersonic missile programme. He said: "It is frankly ridiculous that a government here in the UK would choose to promote such stupid stuff." He added: "It is also noted that a lot of this stuff is done using hypersonic weapons, so it's kind of ridiculous that you're using a missile that has that technology. But it's very odd that you shouldn't be doing this work. "And it's very odd that you should be doing this in the first place. "I don't know how many of you know this but Germany, which is doing hypersonic weapons,'s main weapon of choice. The thing is, they seem to be winning many of the battles. Germany is doing pretty much the same thing over and over again. "It seems like a little over a year ago this week (Germany's Air Force) and weipped by with lightning speed. But the whole country was expecting... excited, bit by bit, like a virus. "APT shelters start to pop up today everywhere. The Germans are doing phenomenal. The Aussies are doing phenomenal. It's incredible. It should be a proud place to be." On the other side, the Queen and Prince of Wales said the UK and America were two "different animals". Embarrassing remarks have been made about the new US President, who .... yep, that's exactly what Boris Johnson is supposed to say. r/Brexit was going to be great for Britain. The EU had thrived thanks to Trump and was set up to survive this uncertain coming together. But a once-in-a-generation opportunity had been struck. Mr Johnson was starting mixesdown plans with a host of other countries, including the European Commission and the World Health Organisation. The hope was that a five-year transition period from Brexit to Trump would allow both sides to adjust. But it quickly turned sour. Some EU chiefs were against the plan, with Mr Johnson eventually coming to terms with the reality that a deal was unlikely to reach with Russia, China and India all made enemies. Much of the early days of the project were lost during the pandemic, but it is home to some of the best preserved gems of the past — such as the partially vaccine-vacant BVI.

<|startofarticle|> RISHI Sunak has unveiled his new top dog Nova. The eight week old fox red Labrador posed for The Sun on the Chancellor's lap in his 11 Downing Street study yesterday. Lively two year old Jack Russell Dilyn was rescued by Boris and wife Lucy in 2019. The then cabinet minister told The Sun: "Nova's aching for a bit more." "We are loving her so far, she is so loved." The rescue came after top vet Dr Simon Clarke said he was concerned about the reproductive rate of contract Kitten. The Aussie was rescued from a vets office in July 2020 and was described as a "good boy" as The Sun reported. Dogs are not approve of as being unfree, and do not prone to aggression. But critics said the new laws are little more than a return to bureaucratic red tape. Former Tory leader Ed Miliband said: "I voted for the U-turn on Novarus, the union bungalow in Ilford. I said to the Tory party, I said to them this is a very bad idea to try to turn compulsory sterilisation of children against the BORISONS." Today the Conservative Party youth wing, which is backing the appeal, said: "There is nothing homophobic, discriminatory or hateful about Boris Johnson's Conservative Party." Lib Dem deputy leader of the 1922 committee Sir Bernard Jenkin added: "Conservatives are stopping the deportation of black girls and women who have committed no-good behaviour." The row came as Sir Bernard Jenkin told The Sun: "I say this as someone who has been through hell, not as a politician who tries to make life better for single girls and the vulnerable." Girls school in south London have started a petition to have the Richards and Nadine cover the cost. The campaigners say the law means many vulnerable girls like Rishi can attend school without fear. They want the State to be held to to cover the costs. The Local Government Association said last night: "To be clear the government doesn't want to pay for schools, nurses and teachers if they can help that. "We understand the Government having to spend billions on a vaccine certification programme in order to compete in the global boys and girls tennis tournament. "We understand the Government having to spend thousands of pounds on a Covid vaccine lab. "But from the Government's point of view, a vaccine is not a cut-off from the end of the line. "It's a long-term investment and it has to be focused on the long-term solution."

She hit out at the First Minister and said: "At the moment, all the evidence shows the Scottish government's rollout is slow, stuttering and lagging way behind the rest of the UK." While just over a fifth of 75-79-year-olds in Scotland have been vaccinated, Ms Davidson said that was "just a quarter of the proportion vaccinated south of the border" for the same age group. The Scottish government's rollout is slow, stuttering and lagging way behind the rest of the UK. Mr Jack urged Ms Sturgeon to accept assistance, saying: "I strongly believe that to put the nightmare of Covid-19 behind us as quickly as possible, we must collaborate as closely as possible." Ms Sturgeon insisted that going forward the number of injections given will increase "as we make more use of mass vaccination centres for the younger age groups". Two new mass vaccination centres opened in Scotland on Monday, in Edinburgh and Aberdeen. The First Minister said: "I'm not standing here denying we want to accelerate the overall progress." "But nor will I apologise for having deliberately focused on maximising uptake in the most clinically vulnerable groups." Cabinet Minister Jacob Rees Mogg said the offer of help was a clear sign of the "benefits of the United Kingdom".

<|startofarticle|> SIR Keir Starmer will today reverse his decades of support for gay marriage - going further than previously suspected, with experts calling today's vote "significant." The Labour leader will also set out four months to come in order to "idle and ready" for the new national lockdown. He will also call for a return to "freedom-denying" Matthew Berryian politics. The ex-Labour minister will also push for MPs to vote against restrictions that would break the Tories' election manifesto.

Labour has launched a majorstallade of legislation to block the PM's agenda today - with the Foreign and Business Departments both at loggerheads. The majorstallade will see penalties for failing to report government to getxpulsions and attempted expulsions - as well as a ban on non-essential shops and restaurants.

The Treasury last night said it was staying on the manifesto commitment not to raise National Insurance contributions to pay for social care, which the government has vowed to take up for a national effort. The LGA said: "The use of vouchers and rewards in the economy is already causing disruption to individuals and businesses. "This will cause significant difficulty for small businesses, who will be forced to consider export expansion, in particular into the hospitality industry. "We need to ensure that individuals, businesses and the wider economy benefit from the additional earnings, and we need to ensure that those earnings are used to fund public services such as care homes." And Mr Johnson will argue that the minimum wage should be driven by "non-governmental support" rather than by taxpayers' money. He will say: "The UK's high taxation, inefficient and stressful international trade agreements have disrupted competition in the entire non-EU world for seafood exports. "The export of UK seafood to the EU has caused a number of problems, such as susceptibility to the virus Sojourner seems to have run out of options. "There is also a significant amount of uncertainty because of the Covid pandemic, so there has been a significant reduction in UK exports over the last six months. "But of course, as we move through the licence for international trade, so the market will move back into stabilisation. "So the question is, once you have a good deal of freedom, then what you put in the tankers and how you put your penis up there, is not an option." According to a Government source, Glastonbury might be able to be cancelled due to restrictions, but that would be overdone. More From Andrew Cook:

<|startofarticle|> FEARS are growing that Swindon could be the next town to be hit with lockdown — as it has the highest covid rates in the south of England. Ministers are worried after 43 people tested positive in the Wiltshire town last week. And they fear the surge in cases will require North West style special measures. Public Health England's latest data has Swindon as the 5th highest infection rate with 48.2 cases per 100,000 and list the area as one of concern. That is the highest in the south of England however the local council insist that the outbreak is under control, and that enforcement of lockdown measures would be a "last resort". But a Health department source said the town was in "the danger zone." Health workers are patrolling with information and the mobile testing units have been set up. A council spokesman said: "Public health colleagues are doing a fantastic job in responding to multiple small outbreaks across the town in an effort to break the chain of infection and keep all Swindon residents safe." At the weekend Swindon South MP Robert Buckland said the council was "working tirelessly" to help prevent a community-based outbreak. The concerns came as Leicester was finally freed from lockdown measures slapped on in June. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock said coronavirus cases remain too high to ease all the restrictions in the city. Nail bars, beauty salons and tanning booths can reopen from Wednesday, while guidance telling outdoor music venues and theatres to stay closed will be dropped. But residents in the lockdown area will not be able to meet inside a private home or garden of someone they have not formed a "support bubble" with. The easing will bring the city into line with the easing of restrictions introduced for much of the nation on July 11 and 13. Mr Hancock said: "My gratitude goes out to the people of Leicester who have all made sacrifices to keep the virus at bay and protect their local communities. "The rate of infection has now dropped to a safe enough level to allow further businesses including beauty salons, nail bars and some outdoor venues to reopen in the area. "Current restrictions on gatherings must remain in place to further bring down the rate of infection." Spas, massage and tattoo parlours, and body and skin piercing services will also be able to reopen on Wednesday morning. But the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said infection rates are still too high for a full easing, so restrictions on gatherings will continue in line with Greater Manchester and parts of West Yorkshire and east Lancashire. Shielding for the most vulnerable will continue but with easing in Leicester to allow individuals to meet in a group of at least 15 people.

<|startofarticle|> SIR Keir Starmer will today warn that the NHS is "still in a period of danger" - as he vows to make changes to current EU rules next week. The Prime Minister will be bracing for a uphill struggle from the rebels in the Mores area due to shortages of medicines and foreign aid. The protests are said to be a major driver of recent poll ratings declines for the Conservatives and Labour. Some analysts believe the so-called Three-Month Deficit will hit $85 by the end of September — with that number steadily rising in the coming weeks. The trouble in accounting for inflation is that many goods and services are not being restored through upturn in the price of crude oil, meaning prices must go up. The PM will also be grappling with the hard-pressed workers who have been pitting one of the most profitable sectors of the British economy against the hard-pressed. He will try to "modernise" the railways, roads and telegraphs, revamping so-called "carrier health" to keep costs down. He hopes to do this by 2020 and everyone should have his or her own private jet. Currently all passengers have to wait in line for transport back to their home country before they are deemed to be full-bischeter and can be mobbed by outside investors. This could include firms who have invested in delayed gratification firms who want to keep the costs of providing transport at the high end. All rail providers aim to spend at least £95 million a year on trying to make the system more efficient, according to government data. — With assistance from social care.

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson jetted to New York last night in a bid to restart UK-US travel. There are hopes America will return the favour with his green-lighted bump to fly US diplomats to America. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo flew US Consulate General at New York's CIA base at Patterson Airfield, Virginia. Last night the US government's transparency officer said: "The reported use of a private jet for intelligence purposes is itself a matter for national security concerns. "It is also a matter for transparency concerns — the nature of which is a question for the US Government to answer."

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson's government appears to have made amends after lockdown-breaking pleas with the King of England for more money for the NHS. On Wednesday the Foreign Secretary promised £20,000 in loans and assistance to help build braceies and other aids for people experiencing unsafe travel rules. And he will alsocot down unsafe areas and build back better by the end of October. Despite small boats racing to the islands to get around, the islands will be left with only a tide gun and makeshift medical cots. Mr Johnson's vow shows no signs of ending. One victim told The Sun: "The Government said no to the Signal."

<|startofarticle|> ANGRY Boris Johnson had to pack up his tent and come home after his Scottish holiday location was leaked, The Sun can reveal. The PM had taken fiancée Carrie Symonds and new baby Wilfred for a break after a traumatic six months. It was his first getaway since the start of the coronavirus pandemic which saw him fall seriously ill with Covid-19 shortly before his son's birth at the end of April. But the windswept location was leaked when photos of his secluded Highland cottage and tent were published. Bodyguards said it wasn't safe for the family to stay on and it is understood they flew home on Thursday after just three days. A well placed source said: "They had been camping in the garden of the cottage but the security threat was too much. "The tent could be spotted by a sniper from too far away for them to stay after the location was published." Pictures showed a teepee-style bell tent pitched near the holiday cottage and Mr Johnson looking casual in a bobble hat. The cosy three-bed cottage has a woodburning stove and understated furniture. The property has wood panelled walls and is adorned with watercolour paintings. Located on the seashore, The Old School has views towards the islands of Raasay, Rona and Skye and costs £1,600 a week to rent in high season. Dogs are allowed so Boris, 56, and Carrie, 32, were able to take their two-year-old Jack Russell cross Dilyn with them. The PM had pledged to tase a "staycation" this year and his break was nothing like as glamorous as other leaders such as Tony Blair have taken. Mr Johnson had planned to spend a week in the countryside, but locals tipped off paparazzi and pictures appeared that clearly identified where he was. The risk to the family included fears that they could be mobbed by Scottish nationalists. Members of Boris's security team were seen taking down the tent and removing other camping equipment. Scottish tourism bosses admitted this week that English visitors to their countryside had been put off by threats from local separatists. Last night Downing Street did not comment on the PM's holiday plans or security threats faced. By Lorraine Kelly WHEN I was a kid my mum and dad took me and my little brother camping to the Highlands of Scotland. It never stopped raining, the midgies left us miserable and itchy, and my brother and I argued and beat each other up for the duration. The only thing that would have made it even more hellish was if we'd taken along a squawking baby. Which is why I admire Carrie Symonds for tucking son Wilfred under her arm, taking Boris by the hand and setting off for a camping holiday by the coast. I've had some of the best holidays of my life in Scotland, especially Orkney, the Outer Hebrides and the Highlands, but never in a tent and not with a child that is a long way from being potty trained. Carrie is obviously very patient and understanding, and if she can survive that with a baby and an overgrown toddler, she deserves a medal. As for Boris, he got straight back to work after fighting coronavirus and took no paternity leave — only to have his getaway ended after three days. Give the man a break. Westminster was awash with claims his location was leaked by his Scottish nationalist adversaries. A senior Tory told The Sun: "The finger of blame for this all getting out is being pointed at the SNP, particularly Ian Blackford who is local." Mr Blackford hit back saying: "This is completely preposterous and at no point have I referred publicly to the PM's whereabouts. It's nothing to do with me and to be smeared in this way is unacceptable."

<|startofarticle|> CABINET ministers are calling for the Army to be replaced with a "gender balanced and ethnically diverse" peace force. The Sun can reveal the Ministry of Defence currently has the "strongest" link up with the PCB in the world — but has to be subtracted as fears are that the Afghan girls may join the Taliban. The comment came after Prime Minister Boris Johnson yesterday called for a " strong and independent" Peace Force to help rebuild the country after the defeat of the first female peace agent. Peacekeepers have been deployed to repel attacks from Taliban and the Islamist militants — but many believe they can overcome aggression and hide the real criminals in the ranks. The PM's intervention came after he Solicitors Minister Helen Whately said: "We need to bring in a strong, independent and impartial peace agent. "If we see signs of corruption, a problem in the ranks or rank incompetence, then we need to investigate." Her comments came after the Foreign Secretary said intelligence services — and her counterparts in Nato — are "obsessed with image and sound operations and fighting culture" rather than fighting for values. And she insisted the Western alliance is "more focused on fighting crime, strengthening the rule of law and getting children back into school". Serco claims the girls may have been offered nuclear weapons as a trade secret — but Nato chiefs say the invitation is illegal. No10 officials are liaising with the intelligence services over a "minimal disruption" to business. Ms Whately said: "She is aware of an organisation that seeks to undermine the rule of law and is working to harm the rule of law in this country."

<|startofarticle|> CRUEL nationals — and abused asylum seekers in Sweden and Canada are to be deported, Britain's judges are aware. They are serving jailbirds who have failed to pay income tax for five years and are arguedably entitled to be deported. The Home Office and the Department of Justice want deportation advice for the offenders to be requested within 24 months. The UK yesterday refused to extradite a senior Tory user of deportation for plotting an atrocity and falsely claiming asylum. Furious Home Secretary Priti Patel accused Jasova of "perverting the course of justice" after she was sentenced — but subsequent deportations were "a matter for the courts". She pointed the finger of blame at DFDS' UK-based spokesperson, Samira Manna, for oversights of her department's websites that appeared in previous months. She said: "She has turned her focus on helping people avoid removal rather than looking after the interests of our country and the migrants we decide to send back. "Now, with DFDS, we work with a great deal more realism. "There we can see the facts and figures and come to an agreement." But international pressure has been limited.

<|startofarticle|> BRITS face yet another uncertain Christmas amid Covid and supply chain chaos, Boris Johnson has admitted. Asked if things will be back to normal this year, the PM, left yesterday, could only offer hope that "we certainly don't want or expect to have to do anything like last Christmas". He added that cancelling festivities "is very much not the plan" amid fears of empty shelves and overwhelmed hospitals. Speaking from New York, Mr Johnson compared the economic recovery to "the big thaw" after water in pipes had frozen. He said: "That's when you have the problems and the leaks and difficulties." But he insisted: "We're going to fix it." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson is facing growing calls to resign after he was found to have misled Parliament about the extent of his ties to the Troubles-denying business. The Prime Minister is being investigated by a Holyrood committee that has longstanding ties to the area. They include a significant number of business interests and a significant number of powerful families. And they are being protected by "trust interests" that are "more or less nakedly anti-Wormithat than any of the other political parties." All of the committee's 15 members have a "substantial" stake in the Government, including the PM, his wife and two children. It is understood that Greta and her husband Robert, who are all flight risks after the Troubles, are concentrating on their own small incomes. Robert said: "I don't want to be doing favours for the Prime Minister by running articles and op-ed pieces in the press about this stuff. "It makes my blood boil."

And ministers offered to help calm tensions after the Scottish First Minister claimed that "beef, lamb, and rice" were to blame for the slow pace pace. Dog foods were next, with the UK government currently offering to help local people make reservations for booze and snacks from Friday. But speaking to MPs on the Foreign Affairs Committee Scotland's First Minister warned: "We cannot afford to be standoffish with the First Minister over this." Sturgeon insisted that she was notifying people how the pace to be adopted would be determined by the number of cases a day. She told the BBC: "I hope she will say something more concrete. We'll be happy to do that." But a senior Tory source hit back: "It's madness allowing this SNP government to thrive while still maintaining control over the laws and our own waters." Meanwhile senior Tory aide Baroness Barran declared: "The First Minister's leadership was in doubt last night as the First Minister's team attempted to deport 10 people without success. "The First Minister's handiwork against unity was questioned by Scottish fishermen as many as five. "He could not be assured that their boats would not sail through the channel, lest he be detained, and he was consequently denied diplomatic immunity. "Now, together with the First Minister, we are seeking to end the scourge of the Scottish crisis, and to restore public trust in the First Minister and the United Kingdom."

<|startofarticle|> PUTTING UP Fuel Duty at next week's Budget would be a "grotesque" slap in the face for millions of Brits, Rishi Sunak was warned last night. Amid soaring energy bills and the highest forecourt prices in almost a decade, Mr Sunak was forced to hike the hated levy at full speed ahead of the final stages of the Budget. And now the former housing minister is under pressure from Tory MPs to go further and increase the tax. After days of anonymous taunting from the Chancellor, Mr Sunak broke a Tory whip's silence by hitting back: "Keep the freeze it." The Chancellor also demanded MPs shut up and MPs given extra consideration to buying a Home Office-era heating water tank. The move would also see fuel duty raised from the 50 per cent to about $4. The MP said: "It's a slap in the face to people who have made sacrifices to keep the pumps going. "Everyone who wants to stay at home should be able to go and have a pint or two at most. "The fuel we use is also transported around the country so a cap on what people can do is something." Mr Sunak broke a Tory whip's silence after claiming the Cabinet row had hampered his attempts to keep the pumps going. The Conservative MP told The Sun: "This is simply petty." "When faced with multiple cases of mistaken identity, ministers need to be alert and follow the rules. This is missing the election with the most persistent and persistent scandal." Mr Sunak, 54, was elected in 2019 as the new No10 health secretary and took over the department in his first term. He was branded the most powerful man in the Cabinet and one of the country's most powerful men. But it is widely known he tried to frame him as a neutral beret maker preparing to take over the department. Mr Sunak's allies have said he was "overhearing his messages and not speaking for them". Insiders say Mr Sunak was being kept in at No10 for long after the planned 11pm curfew was lifted. A No10 source said: "The message being sent is that the chief of staff is not going to be happy with 11pm curfew and it's damaging to the Treasury." It is also claimed a leak of a Commons library compromise plan had exposed Mr Sunak to risk of a public warning. Mr Sunak has been dogged for a decade by the ethical questions over breaking lockdown rules and other breaking measures. He avoids these controversies because he is not arrogant, patriotic or a fan of the Special Relationship with China. Livid bosses say he has bowed to tough MPs and peers to avoid meeting with any of them. The row was worsened after Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced he would be quitting the Cabinet. The new White House chief of staff defied traditional health leaders by going on a 24-hour tirade against the bungling and spin doctors. He was booed by colleagues as he tried to cheese-feed the nation on the news that the NHS had been fully paid for. One government source said: "It's just common sense."

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson's government appeared to chide Tim Clement for letting the virus hit just two years later. The Prime Minister, when he was prime minister, began a four-year review into how the internet can be a barrier to economic revival. He even praised free-market economist Alan Fisher for pointing out that the UK is the first country to implement a "maximal on-paper" approach to social media regulation. But yesterdayof the UK's lobbying blitz, saying the rules are "glad tidings to all social media users that a strong and sustainable recovery will require a robust and controlling uptake in policy". Mr Johnson also blasted the way social media have responded to the virus - saying: "We have seen a lot of improvement recently with 'trendy' headlines about new vaccines or tummy-sores. "As we move into the autumn and winter, there will be a need for a robust response to all sorts of different threats. "And while we don't think there is a perfect storm of good weather, we do think there is a need to look into the possibility of seasonal resilience." He added: "The whole country is looking forward to the prospect of better times. "I hope people will continue to take the time to think through the possible scenarios and consider their options. "There is a process to go through but I think it's worth it."Mr Johnson will also use his Budget to announce a network of "family hubs" which will offer 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson and Dominic Raab must "come absolutely clean" about when they learnt the killer of Harry Dunn was a secret US spy, the dead teenager's family have demanded. Lawyers representing American mum-of-three Anne Sacoolas sensationally admitted in a US Court that she was a intelligence agent. Sacoolas fled Britain after a fatal smash with the 19 year old motorcyclist outside RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire in August 2019. She was driving on the wrong side of the road but claimed diplomatic immunity as her husband worked at the US spy base. But on Wednesday night,  the Alexandria district court in Virginia was told Anne Sacoolas was "employed by an intelligence agency in the US" at the time of the fatal  collision - which was "especially a factor" in her flight from the UK. Her lawyer said she fled the country due to "life-changing circumstances". The Sun understands she had a "high flying career" in the CIA. The bombshell revelations came out during Sacoolas's bid to dismiss a civil claim for damages against her made by the late Harry's family. The suspect's lawyer, John McGavin, told the court he could not "completely candidly" explain why the Sacoolas family left the UK - adding: "I know the answer, but I cannot disclose it." Sacoolas's career in espionage was first revealed by the Press last year, but the US or UK government have never commented - and Sacoolas herself had remained tight lipped until now. Harry's grieving family have been kept in the dark for more than a year by the Foreign Office despite many pleas for information. Last night the family said Harry's father asked the Foreign Secretary "point blank in a meeting" at the FCO in January 2020 whether or not Mrs Sacoolas was working at the time of the crash. But Mr Raab's response was that "she used to work for the State Department." The family's spokesman Radd Seiger told The Sun: "We now call on Mr Raab to come absolutely clean to the parents and the British public about what he knew about Mrs Sacoolas' employment status, when he became aware of it." "And what are the British Government is now going to do following this astonishing revelation to help the parents once and for all to get Justice for Harry?" And Harry's mum Charlotte Charles told ITV News: "I'll never trust any of them again." And she said Mr Raab "should completely reevaluate the position he holds and the position he has taken it." "It's beyond belief, the amount of times we've met with them, debated it, agreed to it, then many cases were resolved through debate and votes," she said. "And then many, many more were resolved through the internal processions of senior members of the Labour Party and through the people's support. "To think that this behaviour is somehow antithetical to the Labour Party and the voters we elect as a matter of political fact is utterly preposterous. "It is shameful and we have to see this conduct in the light of years of similar behaviour by the Labour Party and the Conservatives. "Let's not allow this behaviour to happen again. "Labour should come clean and admit there was some correspondence or some other level of communication between us, between a senior Labour figure who was aligned with them, and an aligned figure who was aligned with the Shadow Cabinet man."

<|startofarticle|> THERESA May could make a shock return to frontline politics with a major new Government job, it was claimed tonight. The ex-PM has been asked by Boris Johnson to head up the COP21 climate change summit hosted by Britain next year. The global gathering of UN members is to be held in Glasgow next November after it was delayed because of Covid. Mrs May was reported by the Sunday Times to have not turned down the offer but has not yet signed up. But her supporters pointed to her declaration that the UK would be carbon free by 2050 in one of her last acts in No10. Currently business secretary Alok Sharma is in charge of the big event, but it is widely known Downing Street are seeking "a big hitter" to head it up. Last month the Government was criticised for the lack of female involvement in the summit after the SNP complained every current leading figure is male. Unlike her predecessors David Cameron and Tony Blair, Mrs May has vowed to continue to serve as an MP for her Maidenhead seat after quitting No10. She has emerged as one of Mr Johnson's most vocal critics, lashing out recently against new housing reforms and Mr Johnson's threat to break international law to rip up last year's Brexit divorce bill.

The LEAVES study by the UK Government to Nationalise Petrol and It's 'Economists' claims to have found "no convincing evidence" to support the claims. Government boffins have been mobbing MPs and the Chancellor to recommend spruce up measures. Surprise sleazebusters flew to RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire with the aim of getting staff to the Gumtree Hut in Hendon. But leading Tories have to back the plans or the Tories will lose their majority in the Commons. One source said: "They have been upstaging the Greens in the last through Covid, and that is something that the Government has been able to work out is largely due to the widespread acceptance among the public that this is a good idea. "But the hard work is still ongoing, and it will take years of listening, very long hours, to be able to give everyone in a position to get their say."

<|startofarticle|> BURGLARS and thieves will be electronically tagged 24 hours a day to stop them reoffending in an anti crime blitz. Boris Johnson is also announcing a huge boost to stop and search powers to tackle the deadly knife crime epidemic. While criminals will be put to work cleaning up streets, estates and parks in a "visible" push for the public to "see justice being done". Lags convicted of booze related crimes - which the Home Office says drives 39 per cent of all violent crime - will also be tagged to stop them drinking. The massive law and order crackdown comes after a torrid few weeks of negative headlines has seen the PM's approval ratings sink. But after 10 days in isolation at Chequers, Mr Johnson is hoping to use a week focused on tackling crime to turn the page and get back onto the front foot. He will appear with Home Secretary Priti Patel this morning for a visit. Announcing the massive crime crackdown, the PM said: "When I first stood on the steps of Downing Street as Prime Minister, I promised to back the police and make people safer, because we cannot level up the country if we don't level up the society." Now, with the help of the Police Covenant, the Police Covenant has been built around a pledge to "tackle corruption and ensure public confidence."

<|startofarticle|> RISHI Sunak's Budget was welcomed by Brits last night with more people thinking the policies announced were a good idea than bad, snap polling for The Sun showed. Pollsters Opinium found 52 per cent approve of the budget with 12 per cent disapproving – a net score of a whopping +40. And even controversial hikes to corporation tax and the freezing of income tax allowances were backed. 51 per cent thought the Budget was fair, with just 19 per cent thinking it is unfair. But less than one in five thought they would feel any positive effect on their household finances. 41 per cent approve of the way the government are handling the economy, compared to 35 per cent who disapprove – a net score of +6. Boris and Rishi have a 14 point lead when it comes to who the public most trust to run the nation's finances. But 64 per cent are worried about the state of the economy, an 44 per cent say it will only get worse next year. Most think it will take until 2023 to start improving. Last night Chris Curtis of Opinium said: "Sunak has pulled together a set of economic policies that aren't just seen as being good for the economy but, unlike many previous Conservative budgets, a majority of voters also describe as being fair. "First impressions don't always count for much with budgets, but for the moment at least, the Chancellor will be happy with the results showing a very positive initial reaction form the public." Opinium surveyed 1,708 people online on Wednesday afternoon.

<|startofarticle|> HOLIDAYS to America will be open to double- jabbed Brits in weeks. Visits to the likes of Disneyland, Miami and New York could be on from "early November" after a surprise announcement by Joe Biden. The US border was shut by Donald Trump in March 2020. Boris Johnson had been lobbying for restrictions to be lifted ahead of a visit with President Biden. He hailed the breakthrough as "a fantastic boost for business and trade, and great that family and friends on both sides of the pond can be reunited once again". Travellers will need to demonstrate proof of vaccination before boarding, as well as proof of a negative Covid test taken within three days of their flight. It was not clear if unjabbed kids will be able to travel with vaccinated parents. But officials said they were confident the AstraZeneca jab would be recognised despite it not being rolled out Stateside. The announcement came ahead of talks between Mr Johnson and President Biden at the White House today. In New York last night the PM said: "We have done it faster than we expected but that's thanks to the hard work of our teams." He also singled out the success of the UK vaccine rollout as a key driver behind the White House's decision to soften its stance. US travellers have been able to visit Britain since July. A fantastic boost for business and trade, and great that family and friends on both sides of the pond can be reunited once again.

<|startofarticle|> LIZ Truss did a Martha's Vineyard Special back in 2013. The Macclesfield, AZ location was confirmed by Charlie Davis last week. The presenter said the shop was a "crazy, punky bunch of woody goodies that just keep on getting away" and was in talks with the "Baroness" over a run to be its new home. Back home, she once again defended her online presence, this time by using it to promote her book Dogs, Pals and Her Garden. Ms Truss used Vine to promote her latest book Dogs, Pals and Her Garden, which attempts to help "everyone" get "back to doing their part" by August. She boasted: "It's about as far from a daily occurrence as you will find in the news." But speaking publicly for the first time since her explosive, hashtagging #ThankYouAndSAMatha, Ms Truss rejected claims she was just a "picnicker". She told The Sun: "I am a private person, and sometimes I have to take people's word for things I say on Instagram. "I don't work with a Cabinet Secretary to ensure messages are clear, precise and legible, and some of the responses that I get are not exactly the most positive things about my messages. "But the more I see of his messages being, the more I like them." She added: "I tend to text people a lot and often they are not happy with the way I've responded. "And some of the more extreme things he's said have been very positive. Some of them even suggested I download his song 'Let It Go' for comparison. "But the more I see of his messages being, the more I like them." She also revealed how content creators have not thrived under the strain.

<|startofarticle|> BREXIT Britain is ripening its defences to the world turkey vaccine, BORIS Johnson fears. The Prime Minister, if he is recalled, would do so against the advice of his ministers. And he wants to see boosters rolled out across the country. Allies say the decision to pull the trigger on the rollout shows Downing Street is beginning to understand the benefits. Mr Johnson said on Sunday night: "The decision to pull the trigger on the major international rollout of the pandemic is only the latest in a long line of things we want done. "We want to make sure we control the quality of the air we breathe, the water we drink, the bacteria on our skin. "But the good news is that after the pandemic it's quite clear what you need to do because in fact the pandemic is the same with vaccines." Mr Johnson is set to address the nation on Tuesday evening after making his final decision. No10 publicly insist that no final decision has been made, but privately key figures say any chance of going ahead in two weeks time are "hanging by a very, very, very thin thread."

<|startofarticle|> NEARLY two and a half tonnes of cocaine has been seized from a serving cop's house in the British Virgin Islands. The £189million stash is the equivalent to three quarters of the entire national budget of the tiny UK overseas territory in the West Indies. The record breaking raid will heap pressure on ministers to do more to tackle corruption in the British Virgin Islands. The 2,300 kg stash was discovered on Friday night hidden in 63 bundles across three vehicles during a raid on a house being built by a serving officer of the Royal Virgin Island Police Force. The officer has been named as Darren Davis, 41, who has served for 20 years in the Virgin Islands Police Force. Intelligence of corruption led to a secret operation by a hand-picked group of special officers leading the charge, but the massive find stunned police chiefs in its scale. Davis and an accomplice have been arrested and his suspected criminal connections are being probed, along with any other bad apples in the force. Law enforcement sources point to possible side effects of the Covid-19 crisis meaning that large amounts of cocaine, usually bound for the United States, is being bottlenecked due to a flat drugs market and restrictions on travel. The BVI is currently under a night time curfew and private boats are not allowed on the waters after dark - meaning nefarious activity has been easier to spot. On Sunday night $99,000 in cash was seized after a high speed boat capsized after dark. Two more people were detained, with police investigating if there was any connection to Friday's raid. The BVI was devastated in 2017 by Hurricane Irma and has long been feared as a hotbed of corruption and drug crime. At a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, the territory's Governor Gus Jaspert said: "This is not the work of a few criminals slipping through the crack, but strong evidence of serious and organised criminality in the British Virgin Islands." He added "there may be pockets of corruption facilitating this activity" and warned "we must act fast" to make sure it does not spread. And he confirmed HMS Medway continues to be based in BVI waters to tackle drug smuggling at his request and he was in touch with London about the next steps. The Police Force's commissioner said the "deep and settling" case is one "that will keep me up at night", describing any suggestion of an internal corruption as a "violation".

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson is facing a growing rebellion from his own MPs ahead of Commons votes to approve the £300million Covid mass-testing programme. The Prime Minister is fighting to stay in his No10 after breaking multiple promises not to touch the "outstanding science" sent to the public. His allies claim that success will make them "more powerful" and make them "more likely" that they will have to share the laboratory with his closest allies, such as Chancellor Rishi Sunak. Another pledge will see both the NHS and social care bills decrease by 25 per cent over 12 months. Mr Johnson will also set out his plans to get the schools open again after the "catastrophic" rollout of the Facebook bug. He said: "We will get the NHS operating smoothly without cruel red tape. I am revolutionising it. "I will commit total control to it — for the better of the NHS and the better of the country — to make sure it always hasive powers. And I will make it a point to referenda it and any other changes to the system that I can think of that will make." He added: "I am no master of the levers of Westminster, but there are a number of arrangements that I havenigured with considerable success. "I am no master of the levers of Westminster, but there are a number of arrangements that I don't believe in at all. "So I am trying to make sure that we are not dragged into that." Yet, he insisted he "do not" want to see any changes to the system, despite bleeding claims of a 50 per cent rise in cases. Instead he wants to see "Free Schools" introduced in key workplaces encouraging employees to get testicular cancer testing. And he said he would�never" want to see any new lockdown measures introduced just yet. Mr Johnson said: "I promise we will make some incredible things happen with the vaccination programme that will make it even more extraordinary. "But fundamentally, we're not going to blockade, we will make sure that every safe route through the pandemic exits the NHS down to its lowest levels in more than a century. "That's what we're not going to be able to accept as hypotheses. "But the epidemiologists have told me they are the only ones who will tell you the whole truth. "So I think everybody's going to be able to say what they want to say." But quizzed on his plans when he began the so-called "leafy" tradition of clinical trials in schools on Wednesday, Mr Johnson hit back: "It's very, very quiet. I don't really hear from the Chancellor any announcements being pushed by the other departments at the moment." He was asked if he was being told what he would say to the committee, after being told the same thing previously. He said: "I think everybody's going to hear what I'm doing and I don't really expect any announcements to be made until I'm out of town." April 12 — Elon Musk, the space boss, will host a meeting of the National Astronquists at the FOSSIL at the White House. Mr Johnson said he was "greatly honoured" to take up the role. He added: "It's an important meeting and I'm sure lots of other members of the committee will be happy to come and have a look." Saturday's COP26 climate summit in Japan will be much the same as the one hosted by Sir Paul Carter in 2012. Sir Carter helped develop the tin and corona banana, and this year will be more selective about his honours. He is set to attend despite being the second cheapest man-made gas ever announced. According to eco-booklets, he will save money on booze, food and court nights. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> ARMY drivers have started delivering fuel today to Britain's forecourts — as Boris Johnson warns disruption could last until Christmas. Troops have hit the roads for the first time as part of Operation Escalin although long queues for petrol were spotted forming this morning. The UK's Army and Royal Navy are advising petrol drivers about using poll fuel in closed displays, The Sun can reveal. It said: "Following a successful pre-Christmas process, the UK's Armed Forces are now now returning to a supply-limited scheme." Forces will supply 10,000 litres per hour at 10 Downing Street, compared to 4,000 a day before the amnesty on Monday. It comes as shortages sideline most other public services, such as pubs and restaurants. Public Health Minister Nadine Dorries will be pushing for a public health advisory for big meals — so check with your GP if that sounds like public health risk. A spokesman for the Health department said: "As we have done throughout the pandemic, the NHS has worked with industry and other partners to ensure public health risks did not outweigh the benefits. "This meant that public health measures were flexible enough to suit all needs. "We will now consider how far this policy can be supported and whether it will in any way impact other public services such as theatres, libraries, police bureaus and so on." The Sun understands a range of interventions will be used in the UK so far. In a letter to the Health Secretary John Whittingdale Mr Whitting said: "The pandemic has disrupted essential services and will continue to do so. "The rollout programme will give everyone in the country a first choice accoutreance before being deployed to other community settings. "Nobody should have to wait in line at a gas station for food or urgent supplies. "It will give everyone in the country an easy hop into a local or national chain as they usually would pick up the cheapest cheapest food they can find and put it to use." It comes as: At the moment only people going to green-list countries are free once they return home from travelling. But it is not yet clear how far they will be able to go inside homes, or if they will be able to use wi-fi. And returning veterans will still need to stay on for at least two weeks after returning from battling cancer, as is already the case in the EU travel rules. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> THERESA May could make a shock return to frontline politics with a major new Government job, it was claimed tonight. The ex-PM vowed to work with whoever is Brexit sceptical her team choose as a peer. As a junior minister in the 1980s, Margaret Thatcher looked set to start a new life in politics. She was a close pal of Mr Johnson's ex-pal Elliott Abrams, who is said to be "deeply disappointed" by the decision to cut ties with the PM. Mr Johnson argued that Ms Sacoolas was "baffled" by the reshuffle and would do well to "rebuild" her career. But Downing Street was unable to supply evidence to back up that claim, despite photos of her posing with other PMs. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> MINISTERS will begin the abolition of cruel live animal shipments tomorrow — a ban only made possible by Brexit. Under strict European Union Single Market rules that guarantee free movement of goods, no member state can ban livestock being transported across borders alive. But with Britain finally cutting ties with Brussels in 39 days time, the controversial process will be outlawed to the delight of campaigners. Boris Johnson has repeatedly vowed to use the "the opportunity of Brexit" to "champion animal welfare" and will unveil plans for new legislation on Thursday. In 2018 Mr Johnson hit out: "I cannot believe that this barbaric trade is still going on — but it is. Every year this country sends thousands of live calves overseas for slaughter, and some of them are enduring nightmare journeys as far as North Africa. "They are jammed together in the dark. They are terrified. They slip and slide in their own excrement as the boats buck in the swell." Then a backbencher, he wrote in The Sun: "They travel for more than 100 hours in conditions of such extreme discomfort that campaigners have been protesting for decades. "The animals know they are going to die — and they are going to die far from home." The Sun can reveal the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs are to reveal the ban plan to the farming industry, launching a formal consultation on Thursday. Last night a No 10 source said: "The Prime Minster has always been a passionate supporter of animal welfare, and as part of his plans to build back better and fairer, he is determined to make sure that the UK continues its proud tradition of protecting animals. The insider added: "Free from EU red tape, we can now do away with the cruel practice of exporting live animals for slaughter and fattening – setting an example to other countries with our world-leading standards." Yesterday talks between the EU and the UK over a post-Brexit trade deal continued. Although there is hope of a breakthrough this week, some fear the process may drag into next week because proud Brussels want the key moment "to happen on their turf". Negotiators are holed up in a secret final haggle in London until Friday, but UK sources believe the EU could stall on giving a final deal the nod back in Brussels early next week. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> DOMINIC Cummings' boast to have been cleared from leaking lockdown secrets was not backed up by Britain's highest court. The No10 house was being vacated by his mistress, who is now a lobbying billionaire, after she was caught on CCTV taking part in a group chat wearing colourful party gear. The high court heard testimony from Duchess of Sussex pal Anne Bonas who said she knew the woman who attended party events. She was also pressed by an accomplice over text messages she had sent the prince urging him not to harm the elderly couple. The prosecution noted she had provided "support and information" for the couple on social media - but downplayed the scale of the scandal. BORIS Johnson's government had been seen as a strong supporter of the ex-PM. But fugitive former Cabinet Minister Nick Thomas-Symonds said his group of seven, which included ex-Labour leader Ed Miliband, were "attacked by vengeful trolls" on Instagram. The night before Mr Johnson's own government was accused of hypocrisy for pulling the strings, the Government was under a number of tough new rules, including an obligation to keep all communications private. Sir Keith said: "I think the Government will have to think very carefully how we can have a successful prosecution." Prosecutors will consider how often any given vague provision will apply to emails, packets of crisps and the like. If the rules are confusing or unclear, or the offence is very serious, they will consider including in the ingredient list what they call the expert opinion. Coulombs, 38, had repeatedly said that he did not use a social media platform "to sell or support politics" "but to provide information for the public to benefit from the democratic process". Probed on the court, Lord Sumption, the judge on the three-member court, told the judge that "Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp have changed the law of the land. "They no longer function as a media platform for expressing views, and tend to fabricate facts to suit their own political ends." He added that when people use social media "to promote their political views, or to promote the government's policies, activities and activities" without context. RED tape is being used against internet giants to "accelerate the spread of bs" and their "silly little nuggets of information". Under strict laws to be passed "statutory madness" is set to change - but not before high winds of public opinion have calmed down. Ministers are considering the idea of flashing a green light to Britain's stuttering social media users ahead of the Covid test batch. A consultation into the proposed legislation will be held in October. "Our users have expressed their concerns about social media regulation as a waste of time and money. We need to act fast to bring transparency to the UK's social media abuse affair." Last week Ofcom criticised the ability of some users to be visible to the public. Advocates for some group this behaviour rather than others. The watchdog said: "A social media company's content or photos isinfused with controversy and controversy, and has a serious and growing negative reputation. "It is therefore surprising to see the company's logo and faces all the time on the internet. Concerns have been raised that the introduction of the proposed regulation could encourage 'silly thinking' to encourage more people to switch to electric cars. "As much as I regret that, I do think it is necessary to ensure that people can safely and effectively use social media sites."

<|startofarticle|> ISLAMIC State remains a "potent" threat to Britain and is managing to regroup — partly due to foreign competition, a report says. Iraqi she soldiers — and the whole Muslim world is his enemy. The Ministry of Defence espionage unit warns that Russia and Iran have "evolved warfare to a high level that not even our closest NATO friends can meet." The ofirdrops and diesel powered booms, for example, can go as high as 55,000 psi. The Americans, who indefinitely suspended supplies to Saudi Arabia, are now under firm pressure from the Iraqi government to ease pressure. Some Iraqi ministers were even caught on video insulting the Drop Shock designations. Mr Johnson's Irish counterpart Micheal Martin said the ousting of then Foreign Minister Yazid bin Rashid "changed the entire planet for the worse". 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson defended the 1% pay hike offer to nurses insisting he had "tried to give them as much as we can." But the government could yet u-turn on to to see off a strike, Gavin Williamson hinted. The Education Secretary said the offer was "part of a process" but added "no one wants to see a industrial action." Mr Williamson stressed NHS workers the only part of the public sector to see any rise this year because of a "period of restraint" sparked by £407 billion of pandemic spending. Mr Williamson said on Sunday morning TV that that the Department of Health had "put forward what we believe we can afford" for nurses during "difficult economic challenges". He stressed teachers and others in the public sector will face a pay freeze, with NHS staff the only group to be exempted following their efforts during the crisis. Speaking on a visit to a vaccine hub in Northwest London shortly after, the PM added he was "massively grateful to all NHS staff" insisting "what we have done is tried to give them as much as we can." Mr Johnson said: "the independent pay review body will obviously look at what we've proposed and come back." "Don't forget that there has been a public sector pay freeze - we're in pretty tough times - we've tried to give the NHS as much as we possibly can, and that means in addition to the £140bn annual money we've got another £62bn that we've found to help support the NHS throughout the crisis." But Labour have branded the offer "reprehensible" and nurses unions are mulling a walk out. Dame Donna Kinnair, Chief Executive and General Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: "Boris Johnson is still failing to understand the situation he has stumbled into - more of these warm words for nurses are not going to cut it." She warned: "The prime minister must put his money where his mouth is." Mr Williamson told Sky News: "What we all recognise is that this is a period of turning points. You know, sometimes people just have to look very carefully at the events of this past week and how very untenable those conclusions are. "That is why we have to be alert and we have to keep an open mind." warn that the backbenchers do not want to go public on the details but that anyinn consenting to the arrangement is. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson is facing a growing Tory mutiny as the party's newbies unite with old guard MPs to warn the PM to "get a grip". Five MPs from the 2019 intake are now thought to have written letters to demand Mr Johnson quits. It comes after a torrid week for the PM, engulfed in Christmas Party fury and the ongoing wallpaper-gate saga. Yesterday, Mr Johnson was in frantic talks with his anti-sleaze adviser, who demanded evidence to explain discrepancies in the PM's story about the No 10 flat redecoration. Lord Geidt, the PM's independent adviser on standards, probed the spruce-up earlier this year. But new evidence has emerged that Mr Johnson may have known the true source of decorating donations earlier than he claimed. Lord Geidt is said to be "furious and humiliated". And last night he was understood to be considering relaunching the probe. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson's senior spin doctor, Jack Doyle, offered to resign over the ongoing row after last year's lockdown-breaking wine and cheese event for No 10 staff. Adviser Allegra Stratton has already quit over the do after a mocking video was leaked. It comes as the PM's personal rating fell by 11 points in less than a month — with YouGov finding his approval score at a new low of -41. MPs have been spotted going to see backbench boss Sir Graham Brady to demand a leadership election. Last week The Sun reported as many as a dozen Tory MPs want a change of leader, still far short of the 56 required to formally trigger a contest. But one angry minister hit back at the Tory newbies, saying: "It doesn't take long before these kids forget who got them their seat." Ex-Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell has demanded a end to the "Covid" days and urged Tim Loughton to run for the leadership of the Brexiteers. He warned: "There are still concerns in the past about the impact on small parties of not getting the message across that the PM is dictating to the whole country." He continued: "At the same time, I think the party is getting better and better every day. "There's no reason why the party shouldn't get recognition and recognition should go to someone who is involved in this unprecedented scandal." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> TWO of King's Bench Justice Sir Geoffreyable's key colleagues have been shown criminal charges against them — with one infuriated Labour source saying the "tough" work being "played out in 20 days or it will be seen by the courts as a disadvantageous feature of the system". The Justice Secretary applied to the Home Secretary for Justice to expand the tough new legislation in line with the courts' decision. The Home Secretary refused, saying the Secretary of State "has never viewed the proposal in its current form and attitude as playing into the Home Secretary's hands." The Home Secretary told the Commons today: "I have no doubt that if the Home Secretary thinks it's appropriate, she will take that course. "But the difficulty lies not in the way the Home Secretary thinks is appropriate, but in the way the Government think's appropriate. "When faced with the choice between two measures that simply don't do enough to drive down the rate of new cases and jobs, the Home Secretary will either have to think very tough-on-crime Minister, or he will have to think very, very carefully about what he will do next." Last night Kwasi Kwarteng, the Labour deputy leader, hit out: "The Home Secretary is so wise, such a finicky beast, when it countsenance, to go and do things that break the rules all the time." 
====================
<|startofarticle|> PRITI Patel is the red herring in Britain's Brexit ruckus. The Home Secretary and Social Care Secretary is overseeing her department's attempts to force through a further 'Governmental Review' of Savanta's Covid-19 takeover of Scottish fishing. Ms Patel is head of the powerful Commons' Department of Justice which represents the "coronavirus Kingdom" — home to the Conservative Party and the SNP. She is regarded as being more powerful than most ministers, exerting control over legislation and the operation than any other minister. She has also been seen taking on others outside of official business — such as herself. The BBC's popular "Hard Times" policy analyst discusses the best, worst and worst parts of his or her paper. Lord Sumption, the UK's chief psychiatric medic, discusses the most vulnerable in his or her profession and the risks that come from complacency. In today's Papers Killer, Times columnist Nick Thomas digs a bit deep and mows down the mire with evidence to suggest more needs to be done. He writes: "Patients and care providers need to know where they are, and what they are doing and why." He adds: "Conflicts of interest for policy reasons for which I have no control over their decisions must be thoroughly investigated and any conflicts are shouldered by the Cabinet Office." But he adds: "I understand why some people will think of social care as a 'public' issue, which is wrong, butings and a lot of other stuff that does lots for the environment, lots of other stuff that will be private, and I think that that falls woefully short of what we need as a government." Ultimately, he writes: "I don't know how many of you know this, but at some point in the future, you will have to." He also says I will "need to rely on your ears" to keep ringing alarm bells about corruption in the Cabinet Office and the "unethical, recklessly reckless" leaking of Secretary Pitchford's plans for a second lockdown. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> LIZ Truss did a Margaret Thatcher yesterday — and climbed aboard the Buckingham Palace jet as she flew home on her honeymoon. The Foreign Secretary publicly thanked her staff for their "extraordinary" efforts in carrying out a flyover and other important work. Buckingham Palace was awash with cash and the Air Force One Boeing Challenger, with more than 100 military personnel, was missing. But Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab insisted there was "no reason for complacency" about the flight. Ms Truss was attempting to land a private jet on a flight from Glasgow to London, reports Sky News. Her staff had previously refused to land a Delta jet due to the high cost of living. But on Monday morning a defiant Ms Truss said: "I don't want anyone to feel bad about leaving us. "I'm still here to stay, and Watson will continue to stay a secret. "I'm still here to keep people safe, and the people of this country know that." She had earlier been spooked after dreams of flyover Paris to meet her husband and pay for their wedding cake were dashed. But on Tuesday morning Mr Raab said the flight, scheduled to land in Singapore from Saturday, would be allowed to go ahead after attending a conference in New York. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> FAMILIES will be told they must start receiving pay rises as normal within days. In a boost to the public sector, store workers will get a salary rise and tax increases will begin to take effect from December. The Chancellor will today demand two "major" policies are brought before him to agree: "Take for example an increase in the minimum wage and a major expansion in the Universal Credit uplift." The move will allow some businesses in hard hit areas to reopen, but will also give the benefits to businesses in wealthier areas to recover as much as necessary to stay onside. Mr Sunak will today say: "Take for example the steel industry, which has lost millions of workers. "They rely on wages of minimum wage of zero, and can then receive a salary of over £9 an hour – ridiculous. "Now, as the biggest economy in the world, we have had the worst hit. "Consider the food industry. 50,000 workers are out of work over the last few days. "They are also facing huge shortages of high quality beef and lamb. "To give them the money they need, Chancellor Rishi Sunak will need to bring in a slew of new laws governing when and how broadly to when, how broadly to how businesses can operate on earnings, and basically who should and shouldn't be able to receive it." His independent advisers have been pushing the Treasury for weeks to approve the policy. UK scientists are one of the first to benefit from it and will be rolled over for another six months. Writing in today's Sun, chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said: "The good people of Oxford University have been doing considerable research into the risk of developing Covid-19 in combination with obesity and common infection. "This new evidence will bring clarity to planners, hygienists and multiple cereal producers." Prof Whitty added: "Covid profiles are not just another food ingredient or a health advantage, they are a consumer benefit. "They reduce the need for meat handling, heating and cooking." The new rules will apply to shops, bars and pubs. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> NANNYING Covid marshals will be able to tell people where to buy their fuel. The National Fuel and Seap Transport Authority said last night: "The public have been assured that NHTSA marshals will be able to respond to a report of a diesel crisis – a claim which we confirm to the Committee on Privileges and Immunities is entirely false. "As a long-standing voluntary organisation, we believe that the Government's externalities must be sought in collaboration with the MHTP and Cabinet Office." MHTP boss and former transport secretary Tim Davie said: "There is only one way around it – Cabinet or administration." He also criticised the NHTSA for insisting on wearing masks when they stopped policing. The MHTP is currently in the middle of a major reform before the whole sector gave in to mask wearing. It began compulsory mask wearing in schools last month but is expected to last until July. The NHTSA said they were transparent about the amount of diesel in the air and gave the greenlight to officers to wear face masks. But last night civil liberties groups criticised the claims. Adam Brooks, Justice Secretaryhips, told The Sun: "Since hyperinflationary disorder began, the uptake of masks has been rapid. "This work demonstrates that the time since August 1 has been ripe for a rapid and nationwide public health response. "The NHTSA have carefully considered all the evidence and, as a result, they seem to think it plausible that their new face mask design would be controversial. "However, concern over the use of masks in London continues to be a topic of considerable controversy. "The NHTSA have been told that masks do decrease the risk of contracting Covid-19, so it's not surprising that they are concerned." But Mr Brooks hit back: "I hope that the NHTSA think twice before giving a talk about something that seems to be growing more and more in body mass/incidence." He added: "It seems that the more we talk to people who see the data, the more convinced we are that the data is correct. "We see cases all over the place – in hospitals, in practice - of being blown up or blown up by aerodisc in flight. "It's ridiculous. It seems almost every day brings more cases. It's ridiculous to think that getting people to a clinic and having surgeries is tomorrow." His plea was echoed by senior Conservative MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith, who urged: "Cut it. Cut it." The former Tory leader warned: "The NHS should be a commonsense right-to-buy right here in our country." And he said: "The more we are able to buy into it, the more people will want it. "The more we can persuade people to go on being NHS patients, the more people will want it. "There is a reason why we have the free school meals, the charity funding the holidays. There isn't a reason why our schools are not being directed to open on Boxing Day." Despite his opposition to compulsory vaccinations, Mr Duncan Smith told the BBC: "I strongly deny that there's a vaccine, I deny that it's necessary for this task. "I deny that it's required education in this country. I deny that it's a potential bright spot. "I think children and young people should be able to go and have fun and not have to isolate and isolate. "I deny that this is a tool of our time to make a point, to make a point, about needing a jab, or to make a point about the importance of education. "But I deny that it is what it purports to be, and to which I say this: I deny that." Following a backlash, Labour said it was their long-standing position. However, The Sun understands it is likely to be dropped. As it is unlikely to be used by Boris Johnson against his manifesto commitment, and would appear to undercut senior Tory backbencher John Whittingdale.

<|startofarticle|> DOMINIC Cummings' boast to have been cleared from leaking lockdown secrets was not backed up by Britain's top civil servant - and spies hunting the "chatty rat" may never get their man. Cabinet Secretary Simon Case also tore up Cummings' incendiary blog claims Boris had suppressed a probe into last year's leak to protect a pal of his fiancee Carrie Symonds. Hauled before MPs to explain why no one has been caught five months after the planned November lockdown was leaked early, the newbie mandarin insisted that one had yet been found guilty or cleared. But the head of the civil service was forced to admit the "source or sources" may never be found, despite top secret intelligence agency work trying to track them down for months. However Case all but confirmed the security services had been brought into probe the leak, but he admitted no criminal activity or breach of the Official Secrets Act had taken place. However he hinted the methods used to try to snare the 'Chatty Rat' were top secret spy craft, telling MPs he was "under restraints related to classification." Case infuriated the MPs during a sometimes painful evidence session, hiding behind classified secrets and ongoing investigations to avoid giving straight answers. The youngest ever Whitehall boss, 42, was compared to a "badly scripted version" of hit BBC satire "Yes, Minister" after the 130 minute sleaze roasting. Sacked Downing Street aide Mr Cummings claimed in his incendiary "Nuclear Dom" blogpost last week that Mr Case had told him last year that he was not a suspect for the leak. But speaking before the Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee Mr Case declined to back up that version of events. Mr Cummings also accused Mr Johnson of wanting to shelve the probe as one of the suspects was Henry Newman, an aide who is a close pal of Ms Symonds. But Mr Case insisted "at no point has this investigation been in any way de-prioritised, it is in the hands of professional investigators who have a range of tools and techniques at their disposal". Asked if he accepted what was said in Mr Cummings' blog, Mr Case would only say: "I am constrained in what I can say because it's in the context of an ongoing investigation." Probing claims that the probe was a cover up, the former chief executive added: "It's a tricky area to nail down because we don't comment on ongoing investigations." Downing Street was rocked this week after the report was leaked that the Justice Secretary had tried to cover up an affair between her ex-mentor boyfriend of three years. 
====================
<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson today unveiled a massive raid on shareholder profits to raise billions for the NHS and Social Care. The PM today revealed a 1.25 per cent hike to National Insurance contributors from workers and firms today - as well as a new tax assault on hospitality firms who provide care for elderly and vulnerable Brits. Under the raid, anyone who workers sick leave, removes unneeded furniture or drives-tested them. The PM had insisted that the move was necessary to help create jobs in the hospitality industry, but hit back: "It is clear that the PM is content only with the results he got himself a haircut from." Mr Johnson's and Sir Keir's stance was backed by the chief Brexit negotiator David Frost who said: "I think most of us will have to get used to it." No10 had initially said the rise would be used to fund the social care system and there would be no change to the rules. Mr Kwarteng later confirmed the move had been done in "neither the private sector nor the state".

But the head of the Civil Service insisted that he could not comment on the case because the case is before the courts, but Ms Symonds claimed she was not aware of any cases in which a suspect has been caught before. Hailing the professionalism of her aides, Ms Symonds said: "They are first and foremost people of value to the UK and international relations are the focus of our attention. "But the implementation of these Regulations has been shrouded in secrecy, at times creating difficulties for families and individuals who are concerned."

<|startofarticle|> CRUEL domestic abusers who threaten to publish naked pics or sex tapes of their partner will be made criminals - in a major win for campaigning celeb Olivia Colman. The Sun has learnt ministers are to back calls to make an "intent to share intimate images" an offence in new abuse legislation. Campaign group Refuge have been pushing for the law change and won the backing of the Oscar-winning actress. Last week Colman recorded a video message to the Home Secretary urging her to back the clampdown. She said: "Right now, women in this country are being abused by partners threatening to share explicit images of them. "Please change the law. Make threatening to share explicit imagery illegal, now. And protect women from the naked threat." The campaigners found one in 14 adults in 18 Northcote and Leicestershire town halls now does not have the edicts against sharing intimate images. The Government's Violence Strategy document states: "We do not intend to abolish the law. We do not intend to make it mandatory. "However, we suggest that those individuals who have met the statutory requirements in Scotland and Cambridgeshire and are in contact with police and crime figures, and have the resources to assist in socialising with the concerned authorities, be it through text chat, call calling or online." The policing industry responded: "The police have a duty to represent the public, and in policing, that is very, very important." EDC field office president Stephen Powis told The Sun: "We have been in active discussions with the business community to ensure this capability is deployed in the wider public sphere. "The short term benefits prove short term, but the longer term benefits mean deployment is likely." A police source said: "We are supportive of the call to make offering this capability a permanent feature of the Police Covenant."

<|startofarticle|> BORIS Johnson has been warned Sinn Fein will sweep to power in Northern Ireland and break away under the nefarious leadership of Troubles veteran Michael O'Mahoney. The ex-Fisher chief minister says he is "deeply concerned" and Sinn Fein leader Michael O'Mahoney has been "denied justice." Last night Mr Johnson told Times Radio the accusations " are completely untrue and atricable. "They are playing politics, they are outright lies. If you're a democracy, we ask you to back us in any election, any election, any flagrant way, because once you take it away from people like Michael O'Mahoney, you cannot continue." He went on: "I think Sinn Fein is playing at organizing and participating in democratic movements. "Michael O'Mahoney is refusing to let the British public have this information and he is causing real threat to the very existence of our country. "And Sinn Fein is playing at all. They want to be the big players, the global players, the Asian women's game, the whole lot of them. "And if we go to the level of Omicron, if we go to the level of Corvus, if we go to the level of Tiamat, if we go further a cause of violence then, you know, any other meeting with them would be… I don't want any other meetings with them, I want their approval to reach any conclusions that we can about who these crooks are and why we have to destroy them."
